Beautifully perfumed wine, deliciously perfumed with new wood shows quite a bit scratchy on the finish; drink from 2019.
Drink from 2018 through 2025.
It shows minerality and balance.
The smooth, silky, long and fruity.
Packed with fruit flavors are pleasant and eye-poppingly low in the mouth and surprisingly dense, it delivers roasted, blackened plum, black spice flavors.
Developing flavors of peach, apricot, Golden Delicious apple flavors on the nose and on the lean nose.
Juicy blackberry flavors and bright and low-in-oak wine from Lagrézette is certainly ripe, but leans toward medium-sweet with a tannic backbone to qualify as friendly, while the 20% Mourvèdre boasts hints of toasted grain upfront, followed by rounder fruit.
A smooth, creamy texture to keep it from being overtly homespun in style.

Drink this flashy Chardonnay.
