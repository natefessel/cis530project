              "[\"Made from vines nearly 30 years old, this ultra-ripe Sauvignon Blanc was oak-aged in neutral barrels, and comes across with Chardonnay-like richness. It's viscous, rich to the point of liquorous—not for all palates, but done well in its way.\",\n",
              " 'Pure Syrah from the Boushey Vineyard, this was barrel aged in a mix of half new Russian and French oak. Citrusy acids brighten up this wine, where the tight-wound, tangy red fruit flavors suggest wild, just-picked raspberries. With excellent concentration and focus, this is a wine to cellar for up to a decade.',\n",
              " \"There's no mistaking the grape in this spiced and peppery wine. Candy-shop aromas and bergamot flavors go together with a light acidity to create a wine that's drinkable now.\",\n",
              " 'Aromas of red berry, grilled herb, oak-driven spice and a balsamic note lead the nose on this. The palate is still tight and closed but eventually gives up raw cherry, strawberry, sage and espresso alongside assertive, raspy tannins. Let the tannins soften a bit and then drink up before the fruit fades.',\n",
              " \"From a new winery that uses estate grapes that fall outside of any appellation besides the countywide one, this big, dry Syrah is very appealing. It's Northern Rhône in style, with cherry and blackberry flavors laced with leather and herb  otes, and the tannins are sizable. This is a wine to watch. Drink now through 2007.\",\n",
              " 'This medium-bodied Cabernet is elegant and supple enough to offer some pleasure, but also boasts some green bell pepper and eucalyptus notes. Drink now.',\n",
              " 'This is a lightly aromatic wine, with faint aromas of melon, lemon-lime and yellow flowers. The palate is soft and thin, with similarly delicate flavors as the nose. Drink now.',\n",
              " \"This wine's tight nose gives little away. Its light-bodied, dry and slightly spritzy palate delivers fresh lemon fruit, which lingers into the zesty finish. This easy, fresh and ready for immediate drinking.\",\n",
              " \"Tastes brittle and aloof in its youth, with a very dry mouthfeel dominated by acidity and tannins, although the texture is silky and smooth. You don't want to open this too soon. Given the core of cherries and pomegranates, it should develop, but no guarantees. The Freestone area is very cool and its possibilities are unknown but promising.\",\n",
              " 'Juicy in blueberry and explosive blackberry fruit, this offers the right succulent mix of dusty spice and well-mannered fruitiness. For pairings, aim for the usual barbecue but perhaps also a risotto or finely made pizza.',\n",
              " 'Produced in the typical flinty (silex) soil of parts of Sancerre, this wine has a crisp steely texture that is balanced by the ripe yellow fruit. The combination is both taut and ripe, giving good balance and tension. Drink this wine from 2017 to allow it to develop further.',\n",
              " 'Dark and concentrated, with aromas of kirsch, blackberry, carnation, sage and menthol. The medium weight mouthfeel shares the same flavors as the nose, but are supported by notes of mocha and sousbois. Needs some time to open up in the glass if enjoyed now; otherwise, hold until 2010–2012.',\n",

              " 'Exotic and refined, with a stately bouquet of violets, mineral and cassis. Sensational quality for a wine from rugged Patagonia. It bursts with black raspberry propelled by firm acids. Then it folds back into a darker space, where fudge and pepper notes make for a warming, spicy finish. Shows off the skill of Danish winemaker Hans Vinding-Diers.',\n",
              " \"Waxy lime and lemon peels perfume this fresh, floral Riesling. It's invigoratingly crisp, boasting tart green-melon and tangerine flavors and racy hits of lime and lemon acidity. An elegant wine for a very approachable price.\",\n",
              " \"From a vineyard poised along Eastside Road, this wine is juicy in flavor and dense in color and on the palate upon entry. Marked by great, well-defined acidity, it's gorgeously floral in fresh rose petal and orange peel with just a touch of reduction, with an additional weight of black tea and cranberry.\",\n",
              " 'This seven-acre Petit family estate is dominated by Merlot that gives the wine its rich generous character. In this vintage it was balanced by crisp acidity and a lively aftertaste. The tannins promise further aging. Drink from 2020.',\n",
              " \"Dry and elegant, with the silky texture and cherry flavors you want in a good bottle. Yes, it's a little light in body and intensity, but the price is pretty good for a Pinot with this much varietal pleasure.\",\n",
              " \"Coming from high altitude vines, this Zin defines a certain jammy, hotly ripe style. Although it's basically dry, it has soft, jammy flavors of raspberries, cherries and blackberries, with a licorice and cola finish that reprises the prickly heat from 15.2% of alcohol.\",\n",
              " 'Light aromas of basil and thyme mix with coffee, cherry and vanilla. The palate is all about elegance and detail with drawn-out fruit flavors, chewy tannins and tart acids. Just a baby now, this wine has a long life in front of it. It will be best from 2020–2025.',\n",
              " 'The aromas pop on this 100% varietal, with notes of dark plum, mountain blueberry, vanilla and cream. The flavors are smooth and sultry, mixing fruit and barrel with a plush feel and a lightly astringent finish. The variety is hard to get but it delivers a lot of enjoyment.',\n",
              " 'This expression shows lightness, freshness and clear luminosity; Delivers creamy, foamy bubbles with bright aromas of peach, honey and citrus.',\n",
              " 'This base Barolo from the Antinori estate in Piedmont delivers a blast of bold flavors such as chocolate fudge, mature blackberry, spice and sweet fruit preserves. It earns high marks for the thickness and roundness of its mouthfeel and ends with a bright note of sweet berry fruit.',\n",
              " 'The nose on this Pinot Gris—full of nutty spice and minerals—has instant appeal. On the palate, it offers a combination of subtle spice and fresh fruit, a delicate balance. The wine has curve but is overall clean and spicy. Poised but approachable.',\n",
              " 'Still young, this intense wine is packed with tropical and citrus fruits. It is also structured, textured with a chalky, mineral feel. This is a wine that feels rich and that needs several years aging. Drink from 2016.',\n",
              " 'Typically soft and ripe, this is already a delicious, fruity wine. It is strongly perfumed and has the acidity typical of the vintage. Ripe red fruits and acidity are well balanced, with dry tannins that are still in the background. Drink the wine from 2018.',\n",
              " 'This is a rich wine from several parcels of vines in the Clos de Vougeot. It has great intensity, powered both by tannins and by the dark black fruits. Serious and concentrated, the wine will age magnificently. Drink from 2024.',\n",
              " \"With its gold luster and strong aromas of fresh-cut wood, you know it's fully oaked. To that end, an overriding resiny scent melds with hints of flowers, melon and butterscotch. The palate kicks up applesauce and spice, while the finish is defined by dry oak and white pepper. Full-bodied and deserving of serious food.\",\n",
              " 'With firm dry tannins, the wine gets its balance from the ripe black-plum skins and fine acidity. It is a fruity wine although with plenty of structure. It is ready to drink, balanced but firm.',\n",
              " 'Burnt caramel, vanilla and herbaceous dill notes lend an oaky feel to the dainty red-plum and violet flavors. The tannins are finely grained but persistent, extending the long, sour-cherry-flavored finish.',\n",
              " 'This wine is 86% Cabernet Sauvignon and 14% Petit Verdot. Aromas are exuberant, with notes of dark cherries and raspberries along with soil, anise, savory herbs and light barrel accents. The palate is surprisingly restrained in style, with the fruit expression and oak dialed back. A core of acidity keeps the interest high.',\n",
              " 'This ruby-red sweet wine is nonvintage made and from Muscat Hamburg. It has aromas of cassis syrup and freshly ground dried herbs. In the mouth, there are flavors of sweet ripe cherry preserves, blackberry sauce and sweet pomegranate juice.',\n",
              " 'Jumbled jammy berry aromas lack specificity. This has a forceful tartaric mouthfeel that supports tart plum and currant flavors. Keeping things consistent, this is angular and acidic on the finish, with sour plum and racy berry flavors.',\n",
              " 'A coppery orange color, this opens with aromas of mealy melon, peach and strawberry. The palate is a departure from the nose—surprisingly astringent in tart currant and red-plum skin flavors that finish sharp and fast.',\n",
              " \"Winemaker Laurent Montalieu has outdone himself with the fruit from this heritage vineyard. Silky and deep, with a luscious mix of berries, it's a supple, seductive Pinot, wrapped in sleek layers of spicy, toasty oak.\",\n",
              " 'Richly fruity and semisweet, this medium-bodied wine smells like cotton candy and tastes like pear syrup. Smooth in texture and mouth-filling in concentration, it finishes on lingering sweetness.',\n",
              " \"Well balanced and nicely integrated (the fruit elements jive smoothly with the oak components), this is a modern incarnation of traditional Barbera. You'll get spice, warmth and a velvety texture in the mouth.\",\n",
              " \"Off-dry, this has solid flavors suggesting cracker and grain, honey and melon. It's a flavorful, sturdy take on Riesling, but does not have the pretty floral character.\",\n",
              " \"One of the better deals for top-quality Pinot, Steve Dooley's entry-level bottling invites the nose with deep and dark black cherry, grape soda and even blueberry aromas, leveled by a hint of ethereal roasted game and dried sage. The purple note holds into the palate, which shows lavender and other potpourri elements.\",\n",
              " 'This fortified red blend was aged in wood for 20 years. That has taken away fruitiness and, as with an aged Tawny Port, has given the wine flavors of dried prune, spice and old wood aromas. The wine is for sipping and savoring, ready to drink now.',\n",
              " 'Charred earth, smoke, roasted coffee bean and raisin aromas come together on this. The brawny palate offers prune, blackberry jam, licorice and mocha alongside tightly packed tannins that leave a drying, rather astringent finish.',\n",
              " \"Citrus and tropical fruit notes are pure, powerful and provide a fine entry to the wine, which dances with melon, green tobacco, pineapple, honeydew and lime flavors. It's big and ripe, with prickly acidity and good complexity. A nice example of Casablanca Sauvignon Blanc with all the zest and ocean influences you should expect.\",\n",
              " 'Minerally and intense on the nose, this Riesling remains fresh and strident right through the palate and onto the long finish. Apple and citrus flavors seem to carry a hint of sweetness, but it could just be the ripe fruit coming through rather than residual sugar. Drink now.',\n",
              " 'An excellent, delicious wine, but it shows a slight imbalance of its parts due to the limitations of the vintage. The flavors, isolated from everything else, are rich, suggesting buttered toast spread with raspberry jam and sprinkled with cinnamon.',\n",
              " \"One of Portugal's most popular brands, this is rich, soft, solidly textured. It's a fine blend of five grapes including Syrah and Cabernet, giving a warm, enveloping feel. Acidity offers a balance, leaving a ripe, full flavored wine that needs a few months but is ready now.\",\n",
              " 'This is rich, but never too rich, allowing some acidity to shine. It is ready to drink now, though it will age for several more years.',\n",
              " \"Broad aromas of grapefruit marmalade, dried tangerine skins and fresh-squeezed lemon juice show on this bottling, which is more fleshy than crisp on the nose. It's racy on the sip with razor-sharp, sizzling acidity, but also nicely rounded in the midpalate, sure to grow richer in the cellar.\",\n",
              " \"There is some green bean and ashtray aromas on the nose, but also some maple-like wood. The palate is also slightly green at its center, but surrounding that is a fair amount of plum and cranberry. The finish is smooth, properly textured and tannic enough to create a dry, cheek-gripping feel. There's definitely some character here.\",\n",
              " 'A very seductive nose of baked apple and even apple juice is tempered by a peppery, greenish spiciness. The palate shows even more of that pepper but makes the full-fruited nature of this Austrian native (not related to Grüner) a very moreish, lightbodied but richly textured wine with ample freshness. A very friendly style.',\n",
              " \"Here's a full-bodied Pinot Nero that opens with aromas of ripe red berry, graphite, and a touch of mint. The elegant, accessible palate doles out juicy strawberry, red cherry, white pepper and a light vein of mineral alongside supple tannins.\",\n",
              " 'Ripe, lightly buttered pears are tinged with a light muskiness and married to tropical fruits like guava in this soft, easy-to-drink wine that tastes like Chardonnay, without the overlay of oak to which consumers are so accustomed.',\n",
              " \"Nice and fresh, and definitely the best vintage of Analivia we've tasted to date. The nose bursts with floral aromas, apricot, apple and minerality, while the palate is clean as a whistle, with apple, tangerine and pineapple flavors. Slightly pithy on the finish, but that's normal for Verdejo from Rueda.\",\n",
              " 'Aromas of truffle, tilled soil, dark berry and a whiff of blue flower lead the nose on this easygoing red. The lithe palate delivers dark cherry and a hint of baking spice alongside supple tannins and bright acidity.',\n",
              " \"Dark-pink-orange in color, this wine is muted in floral tones of beauty and simplicity. Crisp, clean and simple layers of creamy vanilla are mixed with Meyer lemon and white peach. Refreshing and light on its feet, it's memorable in its stony minerality and its full embrace of citrus intrigue.\",\n",
              " 'The immediate impression is of extreme youth and mandatory cellaring. Bluntly, this is not an easy wine to like now. It has a peppery edge, and the blackberry fruit is buried under tons of dark, brooding tannins. Best to age until at least 2009, but it should be worth the wait.',\n",
              " 'Packed with spicy wood flavors, this is a rich, black-fruited wine. It has a sense of structure that comes as much from the wood as from tannins. On the finish, the black-currant-like acidity kicks in.',\n",
