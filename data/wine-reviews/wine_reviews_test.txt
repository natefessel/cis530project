Made from vines nearly 30 years old, this ultra-ripe Sauvignon Blanc was oak-aged in neutral barrels, and comes across with Chardonnay-like richness. It's viscous, rich to the point of liquorous—not for all palates, but done well in its way.
Pure Syrah from the Boushey Vineyard, this was barrel aged in a mix of half new Russian and French oak. Citrusy acids brighten up this wine, where the tight-wound, tangy red fruit flavors suggest wild, just-picked raspberries. With excellent concentration and focus, this is a wine to cellar for up to a decade.
There's no mistaking the grape in this spiced and peppery wine. Candy-shop aromas and bergamot flavors go together with a light acidity to create a wine that's drinkable now.
Aromas of red berry, grilled herb, oak-driven spice and a balsamic note lead the nose on this. The palate is still tight and closed but eventually gives up raw cherry, strawberry, sage and espresso alongside assertive, raspy tannins. Let the tannins soften a bit and then drink up before the fruit fades.
From a new winery that uses estate grapes that fall outside of any appellation besides the countywide one, this big, dry Syrah is very appealing. It's Northern Rhône in style, with cherry and blackberry flavors laced with leather and herb  otes, and the tannins are sizable. This is a wine to watch. Drink now through 2007.
This medium-bodied Cabernet is elegant and supple enough to offer some pleasure, but also boasts some green bell pepper and eucalyptus notes. Drink now.
This is a lightly aromatic wine, with faint aromas of melon, lemon-lime and yellow flowers. The palate is soft and thin, with similarly delicate flavors as the nose. Drink now.
This wine's tight nose gives little away. Its light-bodied, dry and slightly spritzy palate delivers fresh lemon fruit, which lingers into the zesty finish. This easy, fresh and ready for immediate drinking.
Tastes brittle and aloof in its youth, with a very dry mouthfeel dominated by acidity and tannins, although the texture is silky and smooth. You don't want to open this too soon. Given the core of cherries and pomegranates, it should develop, but no guarantees. The Freestone area is very cool and its possibilities are unknown but promising.
Juicy in blueberry and explosive blackberry fruit, this offers the right succulent mix of dusty spice and well-mannered fruitiness. For pairings, aim for the usual barbecue but perhaps also a risotto or finely made pizza.
Produced in the typical flinty (silex) soil of parts of Sancerre, this wine has a crisp steely texture that is balanced by the ripe yellow fruit. The combination is both taut and ripe, giving good balance and tension. Drink this wine from 2017 to allow it to develop further.
Dark and concentrated, with aromas of kirsch, blackberry, carnation, sage and menthol. The medium weight mouthfeel shares the same flavors as the nose, but are supported by notes of mocha and sousbois. Needs some time to open up in the glass if enjoyed now; otherwise, hold until 2010–2012.
This direct and appealing wine offers notes of maple, sugared plum and woodspice. Flavors are light but plush in feel, straight down the fairway.
Exotic and refined, with a stately bouquet of violets, mineral and cassis. Sensational quality for a wine from rugged Patagonia. It bursts with black raspberry propelled by firm acids. Then it folds back into a darker space, where fudge and pepper notes make for a warming, spicy finish. Shows off the skill of Danish winemaker Hans Vinding-Diers.
Waxy lime and lemon peels perfume this fresh, floral Riesling. It's invigoratingly crisp, boasting tart green-melon and tangerine flavors and racy hits of lime and lemon acidity. An elegant wine for a very approachable price.
From a vineyard poised along Eastside Road, this wine is juicy in flavor and dense in color and on the palate upon entry. Marked by great, well-defined acidity, it's gorgeously floral in fresh rose petal and orange peel with just a touch of reduction, with an additional weight of black tea and cranberry.
This seven-acre Petit family estate is dominated by Merlot that gives the wine its rich generous character. In this vintage it was balanced by crisp acidity and a lively aftertaste. The tannins promise further aging. Drink from 2020.
Dry and elegant, with the silky texture and cherry flavors you want in a good bottle. Yes, it's a little light in body and intensity, but the price is pretty good for a Pinot with this much varietal pleasure.
Coming from high altitude vines, this Zin defines a certain jammy, hotly ripe style. Although it's basically dry, it has soft, jammy flavors of raspberries, cherries and blackberries, with a licorice and cola finish that reprises the prickly heat from 15.2% of alcohol.
Light aromas of basil and thyme mix with coffee, cherry and vanilla. The palate is all about elegance and detail with drawn-out fruit flavors, chewy tannins and tart acids. Just a baby now, this wine has a long life in front of it. It will be best from 2020–2025.
The aromas pop on this 100% varietal, with notes of dark plum, mountain blueberry, vanilla and cream. The flavors are smooth and sultry, mixing fruit and barrel with a plush feel and a lightly astringent finish. The variety is hard to get but it delivers a lot of enjoyment.
This expression shows lightness, freshness and clear luminosity; Delivers creamy, foamy bubbles with bright aromas of peach, honey and citrus.
This base Barolo from the Antinori estate in Piedmont delivers a blast of bold flavors such as chocolate fudge, mature blackberry, spice and sweet fruit preserves. It earns high marks for the thickness and roundness of its mouthfeel and ends with a bright note of sweet berry fruit.
The nose on this Pinot Gris—full of nutty spice and minerals—has instant appeal. On the palate, it offers a combination of subtle spice and fresh fruit, a delicate balance. The wine has curve but is overall clean and spicy. Poised but approachable.
Still young, this intense wine is packed with tropical and citrus fruits. It is also structured, textured with a chalky, mineral feel. This is a wine that feels rich and that needs several years aging. Drink from 2016.
Typically soft and ripe, this is already a delicious, fruity wine. It is strongly perfumed and has the acidity typical of the vintage. Ripe red fruits and acidity are well balanced, with dry tannins that are still in the background. Drink the wine from 2018.
This is a rich wine from several parcels of vines in the Clos de Vougeot. It has great intensity, powered both by tannins and by the dark black fruits. Serious and concentrated, the wine will age magnificently. Drink from 2024.
With its gold luster and strong aromas of fresh-cut wood, you know it's fully oaked. To that end, an overriding resiny scent melds with hints of flowers, melon and butterscotch. The palate kicks up applesauce and spice, while the finish is defined by dry oak and white pepper. Full-bodied and deserving of serious food.
With firm dry tannins, the wine gets its balance from the ripe black-plum skins and fine acidity. It is a fruity wine although with plenty of structure. It is ready to drink, balanced but firm.
Burnt caramel, vanilla and herbaceous dill notes lend an oaky feel to the dainty red-plum and violet flavors. The tannins are finely grained but persistent, extending the long, sour-cherry-flavored finish.
This wine is 86% Cabernet Sauvignon and 14% Petit Verdot. Aromas are exuberant, with notes of dark cherries and raspberries along with soil, anise, savory herbs and light barrel accents. The palate is surprisingly restrained in style, with the fruit expression and oak dialed back. A core of acidity keeps the interest high.
This ruby-red sweet wine is nonvintage made and from Muscat Hamburg. It has aromas of cassis syrup and freshly ground dried herbs. In the mouth, there are flavors of sweet ripe cherry preserves, blackberry sauce and sweet pomegranate juice.
Jumbled jammy berry aromas lack specificity. This has a forceful tartaric mouthfeel that supports tart plum and currant flavors. Keeping things consistent, this is angular and acidic on the finish, with sour plum and racy berry flavors.
A coppery orange color, this opens with aromas of mealy melon, peach and strawberry. The palate is a departure from the nose—surprisingly astringent in tart currant and red-plum skin flavors that finish sharp and fast.
Winemaker Laurent Montalieu has outdone himself with the fruit from this heritage vineyard. Silky and deep, with a luscious mix of berries, it's a supple, seductive Pinot, wrapped in sleek layers of spicy, toasty oak.
Richly fruity and semisweet, this medium-bodied wine smells like cotton candy and tastes like pear syrup. Smooth in texture and mouth-filling in concentration, it finishes on lingering sweetness.
Well balanced and nicely integrated (the fruit elements jive smoothly with the oak components), this is a modern incarnation of traditional Barbera. You'll get spice, warmth and a velvety texture in the mouth.
Off-dry, this has solid flavors suggesting cracker and grain, honey and melon. It's a flavorful, sturdy take on Riesling, but does not have the pretty floral character.
One of the better deals for top-quality Pinot, Steve Dooley's entry-level bottling invites the nose with deep and dark black cherry, grape soda and even blueberry aromas, leveled by a hint of ethereal roasted game and dried sage. The purple note holds into the palate, which shows lavender and other potpourri elements.
This fortified red blend was aged in wood for 20 years. That has taken away fruitiness and, as with an aged Tawny Port, has given the wine flavors of dried prune, spice and old wood aromas. The wine is for sipping and savoring, ready to drink now.
Charred earth, smoke, roasted coffee bean and raisin aromas come together on this. The brawny palate offers prune, blackberry jam, licorice and mocha alongside tightly packed tannins that leave a drying, rather astringent finish.
Citrus and tropical fruit notes are pure, powerful and provide a fine entry to the wine, which dances with melon, green tobacco, pineapple, honeydew and lime flavors. It's big and ripe, with prickly acidity and good complexity. A nice example of Casablanca Sauvignon Blanc with all the zest and ocean influences you should expect.
Minerally and intense on the nose, this Riesling remains fresh and strident right through the palate and onto the long finish. Apple and citrus flavors seem to carry a hint of sweetness, but it could just be the ripe fruit coming through rather than residual sugar. Drink now.
An excellent, delicious wine, but it shows a slight imbalance of its parts due to the limitations of the vintage. The flavors, isolated from everything else, are rich, suggesting buttered toast spread with raspberry jam and sprinkled with cinnamon.
One of Portugal's most popular brands, this is rich, soft, solidly textured. It's a fine blend of five grapes including Syrah and Cabernet, giving a warm, enveloping feel. Acidity offers a balance, leaving a ripe, full flavored wine that needs a few months but is ready now.
This is rich, but never too rich, allowing some acidity to shine. It is ready to drink now, though it will age for several more years.
Broad aromas of grapefruit marmalade, dried tangerine skins and fresh-squeezed lemon juice show on this bottling, which is more fleshy than crisp on the nose. It's racy on the sip with razor-sharp, sizzling acidity, but also nicely rounded in the midpalate, sure to grow richer in the cellar.
There is some green bean and ashtray aromas on the nose, but also some maple-like wood. The palate is also slightly green at its center, but surrounding that is a fair amount of plum and cranberry. The finish is smooth, properly textured and tannic enough to create a dry, cheek-gripping feel. There's definitely some character here.
A very seductive nose of baked apple and even apple juice is tempered by a peppery, greenish spiciness. The palate shows even more of that pepper but makes the full-fruited nature of this Austrian native (not related to Grüner) a very moreish, lightbodied but richly textured wine with ample freshness. A very friendly style.
Here's a full-bodied Pinot Nero that opens with aromas of ripe red berry, graphite, and a touch of mint. The elegant, accessible palate doles out juicy strawberry, red cherry, white pepper and a light vein of mineral alongside supple tannins.
Ripe, lightly buttered pears are tinged with a light muskiness and married to tropical fruits like guava in this soft, easy-to-drink wine that tastes like Chardonnay, without the overlay of oak to which consumers are so accustomed.
Nice and fresh, and definitely the best vintage of Analivia we've tasted to date. The nose bursts with floral aromas, apricot, apple and minerality, while the palate is clean as a whistle, with apple, tangerine and pineapple flavors. Slightly pithy on the finish, but that's normal for Verdejo from Rueda.
Aromas of truffle, tilled soil, dark berry and a whiff of blue flower lead the nose on this easygoing red. The lithe palate delivers dark cherry and a hint of baking spice alongside supple tannins and bright acidity.
Dark-pink-orange in color, this wine is muted in floral tones of beauty and simplicity. Crisp, clean and simple layers of creamy vanilla are mixed with Meyer lemon and white peach. Refreshing and light on its feet, it's memorable in its stony minerality and its full embrace of citrus intrigue.
The immediate impression is of extreme youth and mandatory cellaring. Bluntly, this is not an easy wine to like now. It has a peppery edge, and the blackberry fruit is buried under tons of dark, brooding tannins. Best to age until at least 2009, but it should be worth the wait.
Packed with spicy wood flavors, this is a rich, black-fruited wine. It has a sense of structure that comes as much from the wood as from tannins. On the finish, the black-currant-like acidity kicks in.
Dry and harsh in the mouth, this Temp's acidity and tannins are just too strong for comfort. It has modest flavors of cherries, red currants and mocha. Jahant is one of the new Lodi appellations.
A lean wine, all tannins and missing the fruit. It has acidity, a smoky character, but there is a hollow feel to it.
Black olive, caper, oregano and exotic spice color the nose of this thickly extracted Aglianico. The wine is tight and solid with rock-hard structure and polished tannins. Pair it with black olive tapenade.
From a vineyard in southern Oregon that is actually its own, self-contained AVA (Red Hill Douglas County), this wine is approaching full maturity at 5+ years of age. Soft, round and rather delicate, it has the light color and pleasant charm of a simple Bourgogne. Rhubarb, pomegranate, cherry, white pepper and a splash of root beer capture your interest; there is more going on than you'd suspect at first sip.
Spicy, sharp and tight, this is packed with compact herbs, spicy fruit, smoke and black tar. Tannins remain sharp-edged and a bit unforgiving for now. Very young, herbal and aggressive, this is a wine that has the structure and power to develop complex, unique flavors in the bottle. Definitely needs more time.
Aromas of plum, pressed violet, toasted oak and a whiff of exotic spice lead the nose. The palate offers dried black cherry, raisin, licorice, espresso and black pepper alongside fine-grained tannins.
The finest Jester Cabernet I can remember, this full-bodied yet supple wine features aromas of cassis, cedar and vanilla in fine balance. Cassis and chocolate flavors continue in the same vein, followed by a silky, long finish. Drink now–2028.
Underbrush, oak, mature black fruit and a leather note lead the nose on this wine. The ripe palate begins with lush black cherry accented with grilled sage, thyme, black pepper, vanilla and mocha. But the fleeting tannins, soft acidity and lack of energy show this is already evolved. Drink through 2019.
Here's a Sicilian Nero d'Avola with heft and dimension: Aromas include allspice, cinnamon, cherry and sweet almond. It has a chewy, succulent feel and polished tannins on the close. The wine is made by Prosecco producers Villa Sandi.
Opulent and ripe, full bodied and rich, this has notes of toast and spice as well as apricot and pear flavors. With its balanced character, it can be consumed now, but it will also age for another year.
Almost lacy on the palate, with a crisp, delicate structure, this effortlessly drinkable Tokaji is the perfect introduction to this genre of fine wine. Ebullient with scents of lime skin, white flower and waxy honeycomb, its sweet fig and caramel palate is cut with brisk, pineapple-driven acidity.
Offers cracker and wheat aromas, and light white stone-fruit flavors that seem coated in confectioner's sugar, or talc. Perhaps it's the “unwooded” designation talking, but this wine seems a little light, and not much like Chardonnay.
A rich nose with deep cherry and spice notes opens this dense, even jammy wine. It's not often you find Sangiovese this ripe from Tuscany, but the fruit here is very good, and there's a lot of it. The finish is full and juicy, with mild tannins and good length. In weight and texture, almost like an Aussie Shiraz, but with Sangiovese flavors.
A caramel note combines with soft yellow-fruit and spice flavors. It's rich and rounded, with hints of toast and orange jelly.
Don Giovanni seduces with bright aromas of Granny Smith apple, citrus, kiwi and exotic fruit. There's a touch of soft sweetness in the mouth, with bright fruit flavors on the finish.
A wine that is all about crispness, structure and bright fruits. The creamy texture from lees aging gives a rounder dimension, but the main thrust here is minerality coupled with delicious acidity.
The volatiles are quite amped up here along with abundant barrel spices, such as vanilla and toast. The palate brings sweet jammy slightly dried-out raspberry and cranberry flavors but they have a hard time making up the difference.
Made from Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Petite Sirah, it's an easy drinking wine despite the firm tannins. Shows lush, ripe blackberry, black currant, raspberry, cola and spice flavors, with a dry finish. Ready now.
Light and fruity, this has red fruit flavors that are tempered with soft, perfumed tannins and balancing acidity. Some sweetness shows through toward the finish. Ready to drink now.
Seems a touch green and stripped at first, but airing brings it around. Still, there's a lot of fresh wood and resin, which somewhat masks the plum and berry fruit that's eager to emerge. Spicy on the finish, with a decent feel.
Saucy aromas of molasses, baked beans, tomato and asphalt are gritty. Ditto the palate, which is snappy and hard around the edges. Flavors of leafy, spicy plum and cherry are mildly green and herbal, as is the finish.
Arguably on the heavy and rich side, but if you like chocolate, spice and pretty good pop across the palate, this is recommended. Rugged but not out of whack, with meaty dark-fruit flavors and bitter espresso/pepper on the finish. Should come together nicely over the next two years.
Aromas of honeysuckle and a whiff of passion fruit lead the way. The round, simple palate offers yellow peach, tangerine and a note of bitter almond alongside fresh acidity.
This medium-weight, fleshy Sauvignon offers aromas of ripe gooseberries and stone fruits, then backs that up with nectarine and citrus, just tinged with herbal character. Good length on the finish for such an inexpensive wine, a tribute to winemaking consultant Alan McCorkindale. Imported by Precept Brands.
Side-by-side, Sheldrake Point's two Riesling ice wines are a fascinating study of how yeast affects flavors in wine. This regular-label ice wine, fermented with inoculated yeast, has a sunny, sweet charm. Notes of pressed apple, warming spice and potpourri perfume lend a cider-like tone. The palate lingers, countering bright, lemony acidity with a long peach kiss.
Similar to Loring's other single-vineyard Pinots in the exceptionally ripe fruit, with flavors veering into blackberry and cherry pastry, deep espresso, cocoa and spice. However there's considerably more tartness here, with a brisk acidic tingle that accentuates the tannins. Best to cellar this young wine for five years and try again.
Red currant jelly aromas burst into a sweet, but not luscious wine. There is just a touch of botrytis to go with freshness and some crisp acidity. A dessert wine for drinking, not sipping.
From a blazingly hot harvest comes this wine, with baked fruit flavors and a Porty sweetness to the finish. It shows that not every vintage in California is perfect for every variety.
This is firm, in the Pommard style. But because this is a 2015 vintage, the wine is also generously rich and with great red berry fruits. The acidity is in the back of this wine with its bold flavors and concentrated texture. Drink from 2023.
From three vineyards, including Roberts Road, this wine impresses in floral honeycomb and a freshness that belies its medium-bodied weight and pithy texture, finishing in vanilla that never gets sweet.
An excellent follow-up to the 2011 Roussanne, this elegant, precise wine intrigues from the first sniffs of camomile, lemon zest and honeysuckle, right on through a full-bodied middle with a range of stone fruits. There's a refreshing baseline of wet stone, and some very pretty toast from a mix of new, neutral oak and stainless fermentations.
This blend of equal parts of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay is impressive. On the dry side of Brut, it is crisp, tight with intense acidity and a nervy texture that will soften. It's a perfumed, structured wine full of potential with its citrus and spice flavors. Drink this bottling from 2019.
This balanced Cab represents the region and the vintage well, offering velvety soft tannins and components of herb, cassis and raspberry in a long lingering package.
A pure Sangiovese from the Seven Hills Vineyard, this spent three years in barrel. Though listed as “used French oak” the barrel flavors drown out the fruit. The tannins are astringent, with strong streaks of tobacco and vanilla.
Lightly spicy, this is a soft, off-dry wine. Fresh citrus and apple fruit flavors are perfumed and fruity in the mouth. Not for any aging, it's already a rounded, soft, still fruity wine.
With a touch of sweetness, this brut is made from about 75% Chardonnay and 25% Pinot Noir. It's rich in strawberry, lime, orange and raspberry flavors, with a savory yeastiness. The tiny bubbles are the signature of a top-notch sparkling wine. Drink now.
Toasty, dark aromas set up a smooth, semirich palate of creamy berry flavors mixed with spice, vanilla and pepper. This wine won't take you to wonderland but it doesn't go off course, either. Good and tasty Merlot with more than adequate balance.
This wonderfully refreshing, dry Riesling is redolent of ripe honeydew melon and freshly pressed Granny Smith apples. Lime and a nice steely backbone combine mid-palate with the sour tang of lemon drops and a lingering bitter almond finish.
This intriguing blend of Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc works well, displaying richness as well as an intense herbaceousness. This is a lively wine, with its apple and pear flavors, topped with grapefruit acidity.
Richer, fruitier and heavier than Sangiovese really ought to be, but then, this is Alexander Valley, not Tuscany. It's a big wine, jammy in chocolate-covered cherries and licorice, and while the only thing Italian about it is the acidity, it's a tasty wine.
Cabernet Franc ripens nicely in Washington, and has built a bit of a cult following, as it is usually available in tiny quantities from tiny boutiques such as Cuillin Hills. This is a solid effort, loaded with tangy boysenberry and plum-flavored fruit. It's ripe, clean and fruit-driven, and the oak (25% new) lightly handled, adding whiffs of toast and coffee.
Lots of ripe fruit in this wine, offering rich flavors of raspberries, cherries, persimmons and red plums, with a tart note of cranberry. Tastes fresh, lively, and rather young. Drink over the next six years.
A success despite a certain leanness, a young wine in need of mid-term cellaring. Notes of of green olives, bacon, unsweetened dark chocolate, and boysenberries are wrapped in sumptuous, lush tannins that melt on the palate. This bone dry wine needs rich meats.
From the eastern slopes of the hill of Brouilly, this attractive, open and fruity selection shows a fine red-fruit character that's laced with fresh acidity. It has a firm structure, which creates a solid base for the fruitiness. Drink now.
This blend of Verdejo and Viura deals floral aromas along with hints of honey, apple and peach. It's zesty enough in the mouth, with ripe peach and melon flavors, but it's not sweet. The texture on the finish holds up to scrutiny and the afterflavors are good. Drink now.
Lots of crunchy acidity in this Chardonnay, and smoky oak too, with buttered toast and pineapple jam flavors. Tastes rich, clean, fine and opulent, in the California style. fine and opulent, in the California style.
89–91. Barrel sample. Showing rich fruit, this is a juicy, red berry flavored wine. It's ripe and ver fruity, its firm tannins well integrated into the full fruitiness. Likely to be for medium-term aging.
Fresh and immediately appealing for its silky texture and forward flavors of cherries, cotton candy, vanilla and sweet, smoky oak. But this is no mere taste treat. It's a serious, layered Pinot Noir, whose vital balance will help it evolve over the next six years.
A bit reserved on the nose at first, this stylishly labeled bottling offers aromas of bright red fruit, crushed graphite and light fennel. Flavors are a bit simple though completely pleasant, with sagebrush spicing up the darker cranberry fruit.
Firm and full bodied, this conveys aromas of mature, dark berry, allspice, coffee and Mediterranean herb. The rich palate offers a core of juicy black cherry, while notes of black pepper, cinnamon and clove provide backup. It's smooth and round with supple tannins.
This Sangiovese, Merlot and Cab blend is sharp in acidity and has overripe blackberry flavors that veer beyond currants into raisins. Lots of new oak adds char and vanilla. Drink now.
Delicate scents of white flower and apricot lead the nose. The bright, round palate doles out ripe peach, pear and a hint of hazelnut that lead to a fresh finish.
A sinewy wine that begins with fruits de bois and chocolate, bolstered by cherry notes on the palate and just the faintest splash of tannin. The lovely plum-infused finish goes on and on. Drink with the best wood-burning oven pizza.
Suffers from a burnt taste and an overall rustic mouthfeel, neither of which will age away. Although the wine is dry, it's hot and clumsy.
Aliso opens with ripe fruit aromas of blackberry jam and cinnamon bread. It's a simple, plush red wine that would pair well with pasta, meatloaf or roast beef.
Deeply toasted notes emerge first and segue to tobacco, almond nut, cola and spice. There's not much vibrant fruit this vintage but the wine tastes full and ripe nonetheless.
With rich, fine tannins and a grilled meat edge to the blackberry, currant and black pepper flavors, this bone-dry Syrah offers lots of pleasure. If it were more concentrated, the score would soar, but still, it's a pretty elegant wine.
Fragrant floral and fruit tones characterize this luminous Chardonnay from northern Italy and give the wine a cheerful aromatic lift and a sense of liveliness. This is a well-made, simple but crisp wine with a nice feeling of density and creaminess in the mouth.
Here's a delicious, focused Nero d'Avola that seamlessly weaves together blue flower, tilled soil, exotic incense, blackberry, blueberry, black pepper, carob and subtle oak sensations. The chiseled palate is balanced, with silky tannins. Enjoy now through 2019.
Light almost to the point of inconsequence, this floral, citrusy Riesling is off dry in style, with modest apple and citrus flavors. Drink now.
Delicate black cherry, forest floor and leather aromas lead the nose. The dense palate delivers mature black plum, vanilla and star anise flavors supported by ripe tannins. Drink 2018–2023.

From vines at La Sambinerie in Romanèche-Thorins, this ripe fruity wine is rich and full-bodied. It has spice, light tannins and juicy black-cherry fruits. With acidity and structure at the end, it is a fine wine, ready to drink.
A barrel-fermented blend of Semillon and Sauvignon Blanc, this is a great wine to drink with almost anything. It's stylishly dry and crisp with acids, with a creamy texture framing subtle flavors of lime, gooseberry and dried herbs.
The year 2009 seems to have been a tannic one in Fleurie, producing wines that will benefit from some aging. This fits that bill well, a mineral and austere black fruit flavored wine, with a smoky aftertaste to go with tight acidity.
88-90. Barrel sample. This firmly tannic wine has a dry character that lays over lighter fruits. With soft spice and some sweetness, this wine is developing already.
Ad Libitum opens with a particularly spicy nose with tones of clove, crushed black pepper and ripe fruit or plum. It offers soft, ripe fruit nuances in the mouth and could pair with marinated pork or lamb.
An attractively perfumed wine that adds Muscadelle to the blend. That gives a spicy, bright character as well as fragrant acidity to accompany the lime and peppered pear fruitiness. Drink now.
Lots of enjoyable cherry, currant, licorice and sandalwood flavors in this dry, crisp Pinot Noir. Firm tannins give it some toughness, but it doesn't seem to be an ager, so drink over the next 3–4 years.
Outstanding. Almost equal parts Cab and Merlot, this wine is immature now, all primary cherry and currant fruit, unintegrated oak and chunky tannins. But it's a stunning wine, brilliant and pure, with a rich earthiness. You can drink it now, with a few hours of decanting, but it will be best after 2010 and beyond.
Green aromas of grass and mint lead the way on this unspecified blend of red grapes. The palate is full and solid in feel, while sweet, almost candied flavors of blackberry finish creamy but with a sweetness that seems artificial.
Bright, saturated, and deeply colored, this poster child Merlot proves that there is no other place in the world that can do Merlot in this style. Magnificent in color, aroma, depth and texture; it is polished, elegant, firm and confident. Blossom, fruit, herb and barrel aromas are beautifully interwoven. The tightly packed fruit has it all, from red, blue and black berries on to cherry and cassis. The mid-palate, though quite full, is fleshy and tight. The acids are firm but not sour, the tannins fine and smooth and ripe. The finish, still young and compact, hints at an almost existential longevity.
A spicy, muscular example of Hermitage, this wine features red currant flavors tinged with darker shades of cassis and chocolate. It's slightly creamy in the mouth, turning dry and tannnic on the finish. Drink 2010–2020.
Herbal, foresty aromas are followed by a palate that delivers strawberry fruit and some light oak. Not a prime-time wine due to a biting lean finish and thin mouthfeel. Lots of red fruit throughout, but also drying tannins.
Fascinating earthy, spicy aromas and flavors give an extra dimension to this full-bodied and richly textured wine. New leather, cardamom, and cumin scents infuse the aroma, while ripe but not sweet black currant, dark cherry and clove flavors flood the palate. It's rich enough to enjoy now but will be best after 2019.
Like most Tapestry offerings, this wine shows plenty of cedary and cinnamon-like oak, but the soft plum and blackberry fruit serve to provide balance. It's full and creamy-textured in the mouth, then finishes with some warmth and a burst of tart acidity for balance. Drink now-2017.
Fresh and fragrant, this offers aromas of rose and violet with a whiff of woodland berry. The elegant palate delivers bright red cherry, crushed strawberry, clove and peppercorn alongside polished tannins and fresh acidity. Drink through 2020.
Very soft and sweet in dessert pastry flavors. Not much structure, but delicious in cherry- and raspberry- pie filling flavors.
This impressive Rosso delivers a silky and smooth texture, with aromas of bright fruit backed by toasted nut and spice. The balance and overall harmony of the mouthfeel are what set this wine apart.
Blackberry and cassis aromas are ripe and floral like violets. The palate is more tannic than fully built. Berry and plum flavors show tea and light herbal notes, while flavors of coffee, thyme and plum share space on a bright finish.
Mulchy on the nose, with compost, leather and purple fruit notes. There's decent body to the wine but the flavors are stalky and green, with burnt, stemmy leftovers on the finish. A blend of 60% Malbec and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon.
Once past an element of burnt rubber that mingles with the ripe blackberry aromas, this becomes a hearty and concentrated wine yet one with very moderate alcohol. It has plenty of tannins to add texture, and enough concentration to keep the vivid berry and wood smoke flavors lingering on the finish. It's made without adding sulfites.
This is an extremely aromatic and floral Sauvignon that delivers an intense bouquet of sage, exotic fruit and tomato leaf. It earns high marks for personality and good cheer and offers zesty lemon flavors on the finish.
This is a relatively light-bodied and elegant version of the variety, softly approachable and enjoyable even in its youth. Leathery pepper sits atop nuanced layers of chocolate and blueberry, with a tang of sour cherry and a leanness to the finish.
Pretty good Merlot for its dryness and classy mouthfeel. Shows blackberry, cherry, herb and oak flavors, with solid tannins. Beginning to dry out, so drink now.
This Verdicchio opens with floral aromas of Spanish broom and acacia, along with a hint of petroleum that recalls Riesling. The linear palate is a bit lean but offers up lemon, bitter almond and mineral notes alongside bright acidity.
This is a fun and informal Soave with vibrant aromas of citrus, peach, white flower and mineral. It tastes fresh and crisp and would pair with fried finger foods.
Yellow in color, with heavy popcorn oak and aromas of burnt almonds. The flavors are of melon rind and buttered toast, and while the finish isn't exactly cloying, it's definitely thick and grabbing. Seemingly 1998 is just too old for a white wine with a pedestrian pedigree.
Nice, plummy, strawberry and black raspberry fruit anchors this smooth, forward Cabernet. There's a slap of tangy cranberry in there also; it isn't softened to the point of being spineless. The finish is a bit chalky.
Les Meslaines is the name of the parcel of Pinot Noir that produces this Blanc de Noirs. It has richness, a ripe character with fresh apricot flavors, a Champagne that has the weight of a wine. It could do with bottle age, but for freshness drink now.
This is a fruity, juicy wine that Heifara Swartvagher made to be drunk young. With black currant freshness over firm, dry tannins, it's ripe, packed with attractive fruitiness and ready to drink.
Dark and fairly big for a Pinot, almost Grenache-like in its weight and full-bodied mouthfeel. Tastes rich in cherry pie with the crust, blackberry jam, licorice, bacon, cola and black pepper. Dry and luscious, but a bit muscular now. Needs time, and should improve by 2012.
The vineyard is relatively new, and the block from which this wine was made is entirely Dijon clone 777. It's a rich, fruit-forward wine, brimming with crushed cherry pulp and black raspberries, to which charred oak barrels have lent richer notes of mocha. The wine also is quite dry and acidic and even tannic, in Farrell's usual style. That should lend it ageworthiness.
Filippone is a 50-50 blend of Sangiovese and Merlot that is layered tight with aromas of wild berries, blue flower, plush cherry, moist earth and a touch of playful spice. The structure is firm without being hard and the wine would pair with pasta or meat.
This dessert-style wine is very fruity, quite sweet and boosted in alcohol. It has a spicy, earthy aroma, lots of plum and prune flavors, a rich mouthfeel and lingering finish.
From a number of old-vine parcels, designated in the past as L-O and only produced in the best years, this wine is beautifully ripe with great layers of rich apple and pear fruits. They are cut with zesty acidity and a more mineral aspect. The wine still needs to age further, so drink from 2019.
Dry and crisp and with some complexity. The oak is 50% new and very evident in the smoky caramel, while the fruit veers toward peaches and pineapples. As is often the case with Napa Chard, there's a sweet, herbal quality. Drink now through 2009.
This blend of Syrah and Grenache is hard and tough, with stringy, dry tannins and flavors of vegetables and cherry cough syrup. Lots of new French oak does little to make it more palatable.
Lightly chocolaty and herbal, the reserve is marginally fruitier than the regular 2005 Syrah, with the same mix of cherry tobacco and licorice. Tannins are chewy and quite dry.
Emozione is a lovely sparkling wine with a floral fragrance of acacia and orange blossom. The palate offers white peach and apricot flavors, along with toasted walnut notes. It's long and linear, with a refined perlage.
Fragrant red and black currant aromas pervade on the nose of this blend of Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. A lively palate of tart berries and worn leather is supported by chalky tannins and vibrant acidity.
An excellent introduction to the wines of Cornas, this is a gently structured example, but one that shows ample complexity. Coffee, herb and green olive notes intertwine with a smoky, bacon-like element. An espresso note and soft tannins linger on the finish. Drink now–2020.
Dry River doesn't get a ton of press for its Chardonnay, but this is a terrific example of what Martinborough can do. Restrained toast and oak-spice elements complement fruits that range from melon to apple and citrus. It's medium in body, with a long, crisp, citrusy finish. Drink it over the next 5–6 years.
An earthy dimension still clings to the zesty notes on the nose but on the palate a whole load of citrus flavors are expressed without strain: For now, lemon and the tangy zest of tangerine carry everything on this slender but concentrated wine to a glorious, totally refreshing finish. This is the glory of youth but with such purity and bundled energy this has a long, promising and decidedly delicious future. Drink 2016–2036.
A field mix of seven varieties, this is a sanguine, thick and rich wine, softly layered in licorice, fig and cranberry, with a big presence on the palate. Dusty and leathery, it begs emphatically to be paired with pizza.
Fronton's Négrette grape is found in few other places. Made 100% from the single variety, this wine displays the grape's juicy character as well as the spice and violet aromas and damson flavors. The wine is made to be drunk young.
Lean and evolved, this offers raisin, espresso, orange zest and grilled sage notes. Bracing tannins leave an abrasive finish.
Concentrated lavender and incense aromas make for a woody perfume on the nose of this appellation blend, giving lots of character to the core of cherry syrup. The palate shows the same levels of intense incense and purple flowers, which nearly overpowers the cranberry and pomegranate fruits.
Here's a wine that, while expressing the structure of the vintage, brings warmth and a rich blackberry flavor as well. It has a fine texture and a firm, upright feel. Ready for drinking in a year.
Fun and refreshing, this über-simple sparkler offers green apple and grapefruit sensations. Racy acidity and vivacious bubbles keep it crisp and informal.
Delicious and wood-aged , this is a cool wine from a hot place. With as much citrus as tropical fruits, it is crisp, fresh, cut with refreshing acidity that contrasts with the toast and minerality. The wine could be drunk now, although it will be better from 2016.
This blend of 42% Cabernet Sauvignon, 33% Merlot and 25% Cabernet Franc boats ample cassis fruit and is soft and supple in the mouth. So what is holding it back? It thins out a bit on the finish, and some weedy and stable-y notes mark the bouquet. If you're turned off by ultraclean wines made with superripe fruit, give this one a spin.
This bottling masterfully handles the young appellation's tropically inclined fruit, with apple candy aromas and a soft, rich mouthfeel. The flavors nod briefly toward the traditional greener, grassy side of the grape, but it's a smoother experience, less biting, with a hint of barrel smoke.
This straightforward, robust Rosso offers aromas of espresso, underbrush, and black berries. The warm, accessible palate delivers crushed black cherry accented with notes of baking spices and licorice. Enjoy now to capture freshness.
A red fruit flavored wine, light and packed with acidity. The wine may not have the richness of the vintage, but it does have a fine line in red cherry flavors. Drink now.
A solid wine with lots of character and a core of ripe, almost sweet cherry fruit. The sweetness is balanced by complex leather, tarragon and earth aromas, and on the palate by an attractive mineral note that continues to the long finish. Crisp acidity and firm tannins provide a good frame for evolution. Cellar for 3 or 4 years.
This is aged in 100% new American oak, putting tight berry and cassis flavors behind plenty of dried herb notes and astringent tannins. Fine for drinking with a thick steak, but not so much for sipping on its own.
Really too lean and watery to recommend, although it's clean and dry.
High-toned red fruit stars in this wine, a nice showing of the sought-after vineyard site atop Moon Mountain. Soft, elegant and integrated in terms of tannin and oak, it retains the structure and acidity to age well and take on additional complexity. Drink now through 2020.
Extracted in dark blackberry and leather, there's a soft structure that makes this affordable wine work, leaving room for the peppercorn and dried herb so beloved in the variety.
Perfumed and floral on the nose, but there's also a fair degree of crushed stone buffered by hints of green apple and citrus. Flavors are strongly floral and mineral, then finish stony and dry.
A bright golden color and generous, intricate aromas make this dry wine tempting even before sipping. Schramsberg says it has the least residual sugar of any wine they've made in 50 years. It offers light citrus, ginger and honey aromas, then a soft mouthfilling mousse and tangy lemon-lime flavors. Concentrated but steely and nicely bone-dry in texture, the wine will be fantastic with caviar.
This ripe, full wine has layers of green fruits over the acidity and mineral texture. It is structured and shows plenty of tight texture. But the fruitiness dominates, giving a refreshing edge and a crisp aftertaste.
Classic in its aromas, earthiness, zesty acidity and dried fruit character. The mouthfeel is bright, juicy and fresh, with earthy berry flavors, a mild baked element, chocolate notes and leather. Expands on the finish, and overall this is a textbook wine that's honest and sings of what Rioja represents.
This ripe and rounded wine features soft tannins and generous fruitiness. Cherries dominate along with juicy plums, all cut by acidity. An edge of tannins give weight and a concentrated feel. Drink now, but even better wait until 2015.
An interesting wine, grown in Cabernet country, that's as full-bodied as a red wine. The flavors are solidly Viognier, though, with exotic tropical fruits and wild flowers that drink almost off-dry. Plenty of oak and sur lie aging provide textural complexities.  —S.H.
Aromas of superripe red fruit and charred wood match the soft mocha and red fruit flavors on this Croatian red made from the Teran grape. Finishes a bit sour with mouth-puckering acidity and tannins.
Too young now. The wine is tannic and acidic, with cherry-berry flavors. It's not really very interesting; instead it's kind of raw and dry. Maybe it will go someplace.
This tight and mineral wine reflects the granite terroir on which it is grown. It was made with semi-carbonic cold maceration without addition of yeast or SO2. The fruit is still lean and needs time to round out and balance the acidity. Drink from 2016.
A full-bodied expression of the variety, blended with 5% Cabernet Sauvignon, this soft, rounded wine is dense in blueberry and currant, with a complexity of leather, pencil and soy. A pinpoint of reduction on the finish gives it a tinge of bitterness.
A serious and structured wine, N'Antia shows spicy black cherry and tobacco aromas, and plenty of toasty new oak as well. It's firm and somewhat tight right now, with bitter chocolate, cherry and mineral flavors peeking through the oaky frame. More of the delicate cherry fruit starts to emerge on the finish. A year or two of bottle age will bring this beauty around
Wonderfully fruity, this is a clean, crisp and food-friendly rosé. It poised and elegant, with a ripe fruit character that's balanced by taut acidity and lime zest flavor.
A fresh wine with juicy red fruits, but weighed down by harsh tannins. The mouthfeel is dry, just bitter. It's only in the finish that good fruit acidity shows through.
Dark and brooding, this Cuvée of Cabernet Sauvignon with smaller amounts of Petit Verdot and Malbec opens with spicy acidity before it delves into mouthcoating layers of mocha and black licorice. Nearly black in color and definitely full bodied, it finishes with length and a strong seasoning of cinnamon.
A lovely, delicate Pinot Noir, with vibrant acidity that creates a searing cut across the palate and into the finish. Bone dry, with subtle flavors of cranberry and sour cherry, it needs food. Try with ahi tuna, either tartare or grilled, or beef carpaccio.
The legendary Mouchão, one of Portugal's most revered wines, has finally made it to this country. Made in traditional open stone fermenters, this is not a modern wine. It's a wine, whose dark tannins and dense fruits demand attention and time. At this stage—six years in—it remains a baby, but in another five years, it will start to be a great wine, one that will show a hedonistic mix of power and beauty.
WIth cinnamon-tinged lushness on the nose, this Petite is inviting from the start. It delves satisfyingly into raspberry and blackberry flavors with bits of toast and tar, especially on the finish. Soft and layered with a tannic bite, it's ready to drink now or lay down for several years.
Kestrel vineyard grapes (75% Cabernet Sauvignon/25% Cabernet Franc) are sourced to make this wine. This follow-up  to the inaugral 2002 seems tannic, hard, and volatile. Give it plenty of air and it smoothes out some, but still hits that hard, green, tannic wall. Chewy, highly astringent and disjointed. The plastic cork seems out of place in a wine at this price point.
With all the freshness given by the Négrette, this is a red fruit dominated wine, its acidity ripe, touched by candy and strawberries. This is a wine to drink now, with all the crispness of 2004 still in place.
Perfumed plum and raspberry aromas are slightly earthy and leathery. This is medium-to-full in body, with smooth, chunky tannins. Earthy, lightly baked plum and wild-berry flavors finish loamy and expansive. Drink through 2017.
An easy to like Merlot, with the weight of Cabernet. Smooth, ripely soft tannins, lots of smoky new oak, and true varietal flavors of ripe cherries, black raspberries, cocoa and vanilla. Finishes soft and fruity.
There are some interesting things here, and also some problems. On the plus side is a dry, silky mouthfeel and a persistence of cherries into the finish. But this Pinot is overly soft, and those cherries are kind of one-dimensional.
Can Blau's wines are always black in color and fully extracted. This is no different, and its aromas of boysenberry and wood smoke are inviting. Full, flush and meaty on the palate, this multigrape blend pours on the black plum, blackberry and boysenberry flavors, while the finish is dense and chocolaty. Drink through 2020.
Intense aromas of candied orange peel and honeycomb are accented by pollen and spice on the nose of this rich, mouth-clinging ice wine. The palate is sunny and plush, marked by sunny acidity and ripe yellow apple and tangerine flavors. A lingering thread of bitter cardamom and spice lend interest to the finish.
A pretty Pinot, showing just the right balance of weight and fruit. It's light and silky in the mouth, but the raspberry and dried red currant flavorsare developed and delicious. With crisp acidity, it's fine for drinking now with lamb, steak, salmon or tuna.
The nose isn't very expressive but the firm palate delivers red berry, menthol and baking spice. Assertive refined tannins provide the backbone. Give this time to fully develop.
This succulent wine's bright, well-defined fruit flavors of pineapple, grapefruit and citrus add life and lift across the entire palate. The fruit is the star here, and whatever new oak has been applied has been used well. There is just the right touch of butterscotch and toasted almond on the finish, but the fruit keeps the flavors rolling through the back of the palate for a long, leisurely ride.
A simple but effective Chardonnay. It gets the basics right, with apricot, pear and orange juice flavors, with a touch of buttercream.
Warm and toasty, with heavy aromas of vanilla and nuts along with a soft, creamy, low-acid palate to match. The wine pours on the banana, oak and vanilla flavors before turning flat on the back end. Ripe and friendly but not much power.
This is a dark, earthy wine. Clove and leather notes accent modest black-cherry fruit, but the texture is plush and silky, making it approachable now.
Made from Sangiovese selected from top sites in Carpineto's Poggio Sant'Enrico vineyards and aged in barriques, this wine opens with plum, underbrush and coffee aromas. The palate is youthful and well balanced, delivering restrained black fruit, spice, espresso and oak flavors. Drink after 2016.
This wine leads with vanilla over characteristic varietal notes. The palate is spritzy, while modest flavors of nectarine and citrus finish light.
Jammy strawberry, crushed raspberry and mineral aromas define the bouquet. The palate is lifted by good acidity, while flavors of vanilla and tomato accent the raspberry and plum fruits. Fresh and subtle on the finish, this is a middleweight wine with a juicy disposition.
Sweet, tropical aromas lead the way, followed by notes of melon and vanilla. It feels fresh, with citrus and lychee flavors. The finish is tropical and green tasting, with nervy acidity.
Buttery warmth shows on the nose of this wine by vintner Travis Proctor, alongside poached pear fruit and an iodine edge. Featuring original artwork by James Caprell on the label, the wine offers pan-seared golden apples, tart pear skin and more of the iodine edge once sipped.
Blackberry, black cherry and blueberry aromas are cut by complex hints of dark chocolate and nutmeg on this Cabernet Franc and Merlot blend. The tannins are quite firm on the palate, framing black plums, vanilla, caramel, dill and dried mint flavors. Drinking 2018–2030 will allow more black cherry and blueberry character to evolve on the sip.
This is a perfectly good, honest Chilean SB with snappy, pungent aromas of gooseberry, grapefruit and lime. The mouth is racy as it should be, with textbook lime, grapefruit, nettle and pithy flavors. If there's any drawback, it's on the finish, which ends with bitterness.
A blend of 51% Cabernet and 49% Merlot, this is fully mature and not likely to improve further, but it is a rich, succulent mouthful of red wine. Savory and sweet elements combine easily, mingling meat and umami notes with plummy fruit and cigarbox nuances.
This ripe Chardonnay has a soft texture and only the lightest minerality. It is fresh, tangy with lemon-zest flavors and refreshing acidity. The aftertaste with a burst of crispness is particularly attractive.
Released, for some reason, at the age of four-plus years, this Syrah is losing fruit and showing its age. It's dry and tannic and showing some vegetal, herbal bones, but with enough of a blackberry and cherry coat to get by. Not going anywhere.
There's a highly stemmy quality to this interesting wine from one of the appellation's multi-generation families. The nose shows funky herbs, papilla chile and raspberry extract, leading into a very spicy, savory palate of marjoram, Indian spices and green olive laid across pungent cranberry fruits. It's a winner for fans of stem inclusion.
Parceto is an earthy, resiny wine with loads of ripe fruit and dark spice elements. Smoke, mesquite and barbecue tones come though on the wine's long, but not overly intense fade.
Light red-fruit aromas include a note of chewing gum. This wine is medium in body and solid in feel. Currant and nectarine flavors are basic and snappy, persisting on the finish.
This 100% varietal wine is a blend of fruit from Grand Ciel (42%), Upchurch (31%), Ciel du Cheval (19%) and Klipsun vineyards. Wound-up aromas of black cherry and barrel spice are followed by pitch-black-fruit flavors, with the tannins combed to a fine sheen. It flat out impresses.
Despite plenty of vanilla and oak on the nose, this Cab Franc is powerful enough to show plenty of varietal character: scents of tobacco and flowers are accented by just the merest hint of green bean. On the palate, the cassis fruit stands out, shaded by layers of cinnamon and clove, with less weight than a Napa Cabernet Sauvignon. Supple, spicy and long on the finish.
This perenially mediocre wine is a little worse in 2012. It smells blowsy, floral and strange, while in the mouth it's like oaky apple cider. Flavors of cider and faux oak are less than impressive, as is the overall balance.
This wood-aged wine comes from a small parcel of old vines in the Quinta Nova vineyard. With its ripe, smooth and creamy texture, it has a full, almost Burgundian feel. Ripe peach combines with vanilla to make a wine that has concentration and richness, cut with final acidity.
This is a Portuguese classic. Made in a structured style, it is dry with plenty of tannins under the fruit. It is a real food wine, with its black-currant flavors firmly under control. The wine will be ready to drink from late 2017.
This Barolo shows the forwardness of the vintage—it's delicious now. The fragrance shows ripe plum, balsamic herbs and a whiff of leather. The palate offers lush black cherry and plum flavors layered with coffee and chocolate notes and big but ripe tannins. Imported by Superior Wines and Specialty Cellars.
Made from certified biodynamic grapes and the Musqué clone, this is crisp with a creamy texture and a long finish. Tasting of brioche, lemon chiffon and wood, it screams out for seafood.
A traditional Riesling in the dry style, this wine is crisp and clean to the point of austerity, with the main components reduced to green apple, lime and chalky minerality. Long and tart on the finish. Drink now for its briskness, or try extended aging to see if honeyed complexity emerges in a decade or more.
Bright pink in color, this is a fresh wine with some citrus character that gives crispness. A sweeter side shows at the end and gives a soft aftertaste.
Clear and lucid to the eye, this Verdejo shows pine, grapefruit, orange and apple aromas along with oily pith. The mouthfeel is more plump and wet than defined, while lychee and melon flavors are offset by tolerable bitter pyrazines and grapefruit flavors.
Aromas of flowers, herb, wood spice and dark fruit lead to plentiful dark-berry flavors. It shows the warmth of the vintage.
Barrel influences takes over aromatically, with notes of wood, toast and dark chocolate in front of golden raisins, with the fruit seeming somewhat dried out. The palate brings tart cranberry and cherry flavors that show a sense of liveliness. Good things are going on but the aromas and palate seem a bit disconnected at present.
Steve Leveque, the winemaker at Chalk Hill, is doing everything right. Everything he touches is gold, including Cabernet. The '03 is extraordinarily balanced and beautiful, a dry, ripe wine of power and full-bodied substance, but enormous subtlety. The cassis fruit meshes seamlessly with toasty new oak to produce compellingly complex flavors. Drink now through 2010.
Blended from selected vineyards across the Sonoma Coast near Carneros, including the producer's own estate, this wine is made to be approachable and ready to go. It was aged in neutral oak casks, stainless steel and some larger neutral French oak. Herb and mint stand out against a backdrop of rustic black cherry.
A lovely Chardonnay to drink tonight, this one, from the winery's fine Carneros vineyard on the Napa side, shows bright, mineral-infused pineapple, lime and spicy clove and pepper flavors. The acidity will balance a rich dish, such as seared scallops in a coconut-curry sauce.
Some good things are going on with this wine, including abundant red fruit and a soft feel. However the wood overpowers them with strong aromas and flavors of vanilla, dill and coconut along with a bitter note that distracts.
Fiery stuff with aromas that suggest cheese and leather. The mouth has a forward feel and then leafy, herbal berry flavors with sides of compost and leather. Lightly herbal on the finish, and while it's big, sweet and chunky, it doesn't click to the maximum.
Ferrari's sparkling wines are always creamy and smooth. This Perlé Brut expression opens with fine nuances of baked bread, almond and mature fruit followed by brighter tones of citrus and honey.
Crisp, steely and linear with grapefruit and pineapple flavors, this is a refreshing Pinot Gris from one of Lake County's newer sub-appellations. It's an interesting contrast to the winery's upfront and fruity Pinot Grigio. On the finish there's a hint of tree nuts.
Saxum has taken a considerable price increase with the '05, which is a blend of Syrah and Grenache, with a touch of Mourvedre. It's a soft, rich wine, powerful in red and black currant, cherry liqueur, chocolate and licorice   flavors. It's also fairly tough in tannins, although acidity is low. That gives it a slight rusticity. Drink now.
A fresh, lemon-scented wine, with white flower aromas and soft, crisp lime flavors. The wine has some softness as well as an attractive zesty finish. Screwcap.
Vendôme's situation, north of the River Loire, naturally lends itself to this bright style of rosé. It has a fine structure, forward red fruits and a light vanilla touch, well balanced and ready for food.
This starts with a smoky aroma, like charred steak over the grill. Then highly concentrated fruit flavors zoom across the tongue, along with very firm tannins and powerful, ripe blackberry and blueberry flavors backed by a mouth-coating texture. It's an unusually focused and structured wine.
A slight herbal edge graces the dark plum and cassis fruit aromas and flavors of this wine, with a straightforward and overall quite approachable character. Medium weight in the mouth with light tannins and an easy finish. Drink now.
There's a tiny bit of effervescence in this twist-top bottling, which shows light cola, red cherry and pencil shaving notes on the nose. The entry to the palate is soft, bringing tart cranberry and thyme flavors, with a light vanilla note on the finish.
The blend is 70% Pinot Blanc, with Riesling and Pinot Noir splitting the rest. The winery calls it a “red-style white” and it has some tawny color from five days fermenting on the skins. But it's simply odd, flat and lifeless, with dusty generic fruit.
Horse & Plow turns out so many lovely wines it's heartbreaking not to include this one in the mix. It was sourced from one of the great organic Mendocino vineyards, old vines no less, but there just wasn't much there, the wine tasting tight without much fruit.
Yellow fruits lead off this sophisticated wine. With its creamy texture, overlaid by a more steely texture, it's a wine that has aging potential as well as present fruitiness for early drinking. So age for four years or give in to the freshness now. Screwcap.
Very ripe and aromatic, throwing out cascades of inviting scents. New toasty oak dominates, with undercurrents of blackberry jam, blueberry, mocha and anise. In the mouth, huge, lush, powerful, an explosively fruity young wine, yet maintains balance and elegance. Really good. Best now–2015.
Initially earthy in character, this is a powerful blend of Touriga Nacional with Bordeaux grapes. It is still young, but is showing a great intensity and concentration. It has weight and a firm core of very dry tannins interwoven with black, juicy fruits. It should develop into a complex, rich wine. Drink from 2017.
A selection of the best lots of the vintage, here sourced entirely from biodynamically-farmed blocks of the Maresh Vineyard in the Dundee Hills. Among the most Burgundian of all Oregon Pinots, this complex, cellar-ready wine shows ripe red and black fruits, old vine hints of dried leaves, light herb and autumnal profundity.
This is Midnight's most expensive red, a blend of all five Bordeaux reds. Like its other '04 reds, it shows great poise and balance, with very ripe fruit in equilibrium with strong tannins, new oak and just-so acidity. The result is just fine. Midnight has quietly been working at its reds for years, and it shows.
This moderately aromatic wine offers notes of yellow apple, flowers and ale. It's medium bodied with watery fruit flavors, pulling up short on the back half.
Light bodied and fruit-driven, this wine leads with refreshing, easy citrus notes and friendly red apple nuances. It finishes dry.
Pieropan's base Soave is not labeled “Classico” only because the wine is packaged in a screw cap bottle. You'll love the fresh notes here of chopped sage, citrus, pear and spring flower. Fifteen percent Trebbiano di Soave is added to the blend.
Small in production and clearly defined from Carneros, this Blanc de Noirs blends 92% Pinot Noir with 8% Chardonnay to great effect. Pretty in peach color, the intense flavors are a combination of fresh-cut herb and strawberry kirsch.
An attractive pale-pink color and light red-berry aromas introduce this fruity and fresh wine. It is crisp with red fruit flavors that are bright and lively. Acidity and a light texture make this a fine apéritif style of wine.
The most structured of Trinchero's single-vineyard Cabernets, with supple tannins to counter the lush chocolate, cassis and tobacco flavors. Longest on the finish as well.
This is a well made Gewürz that just lacks a bit of intensity. Pear, spice and a hint of pineapple on the nose; pineapple and pear flavors in the mouth. Finishes crisp and mouthwatering, bringing you back for another sip. Imported by Wimbledon Wine Company.
This Burgundian-styled Oz Pinot is harmonious and sturdy, though a little tight and sour at this stage. Tree bark and meat aromas usher in mixed cherries, orange peel and oak flavors. Medium-long and chewy on the finish. Could benefit from a few years in the cellar. Imported by Epic Wines.
Shy aromas of crisp yellow apple and brown sugar follow up on the palate, with compelling hints of orange blossom along the way. Quaffable and likable, it's made from 100% Chardonnay and finishes mellow and refined.
Monterey's cool-climate flavors of lemons and limes marry richer, more tropical Santa Barbara notes in this creamy smooth Chardonnay. Oak plays a prominent role, lending an edge of vanilla and buttered toast. This is a very good price for the quality.
Now for something completely different. Wild strawberry leads the way aromatically on this lean, high-toned Cabernet, lower in alcohol than most of its peers. The fruit is tight and structured, the wine angular and soft, with a seasoning of herb on the finish.
A touch of earthy peach appears on the nose. The palate repeats that earthy peach theme and adds some lemon freshness. This is aromatic, off dry and should be drunk while flavors are at their peak.
Berry, baking spice, dried iris, mint and a hint of vanilla come together on this structured wine. On the palate, notes of white pepper, sage, anise, orange zest and yellow peach accent the red cherry core while a balsamic note closes the finish. Firm, refined tannins provide the backbone.
This is a lightweight, refreshing rosé, with charming aromas and flavors of crushed stone, tart cherries and fresh limes and a crisp, citrusy finish. Drink it up before winter.
Lightly volatile, balsamic aromas blend with cedary notes and berry scents. This feels round and fresh, which is typical of the Uco Valley. Blueberry, spiced plum and cassis flavors finish with chocolaty oak and mocha flavors as well as juicy acidity.
This seems as if it was assembled from lesser barrels. It's pleasant, very light, simple and tart; the dominant flavor is cranberry juice.
Immediately this wine stands out from most Aragón-region Garnachas. It's deep and poised, with smoky blackberry aromas. The palate is deftly woven, saturated and meaty but also creamy and smooth, with mocha and controlled tannins. Freshness is not lost despite its modern, clean power. Drink now through 2013.
This estate selection is herbal and tart, with a mix of cranberry and strawberry fruit. It has tangy acidity also, and would best be drunk with a roast of pork or poultry.
Rather oily and hard on the nose, with dried cheese, brett, mint and black fruit. The palate is rich and extremely forward, and the flavors are sweet but not that substantive or complex. Chocolate and mocha on the finish are about as much carry-through as you get.
Produced just north of Sancerre, this wine shares many of the fresh, lightly herbal characters of those wines, just on a smaller, softer scale. Fruity with lemon zest and crisp acidity, it is ready to drink now, though will be better from late 2016.
This is an elegant wine that's finely balanced with acidity and a chalky, steely texture. The wine is delicate, fresh and very perfumed. The acidity on the finish lends a highly-strung, tense aftertaste.
This gets special attention because winemaker Kevin Riley is one of the few to engage with old vines of the historic Mission grape variety. Light watermelon, orange spritz and wet cement show on the nose, while the slightly watery palate offers red fruit, crushed rock and citrus rinds on the finish.
Onion-skin color leads to a wine that is packed with deep fruit flavors. Considerably dry but a great food wine, with good acidity and ability to age well in bottle. The sample tasted was too young, and needed at least a year's aging. Imported by Domaine Select Wine Estates.
This is one of the vintage's knockout rosés, thanks in part to the Grenache and Gamay grapes that make up the blend. It's pale pink in color, with supple lime pith, strawberry, chalk and melon aromas. The palate is tense with structure, its bubblegum and lemon peel flavors riding a wave of acidity that persists long into the finish.
A heady, minty nose is joined by fuller fruit of green and yellow pear. On the palate, highlights of pepper appear amidst lemon and grapefruit peel. This is sleek and slender, with wonderfully zesty concentration and brisk freshness. Take your time drinking this, there is a lot going on.
Rich and soft, this Castelão-based rosé seems to miss out on freshness and acidity. Instead, it is broad, full in the mouth and heavy. It could work with food.
An assertive oak influence gives this full-bodied wine a cedar and pencil shavings aroma. On the palate ripe black cherry flavors mingle with more spicy, perfumed oak elements. It's quite tannic, but the ripe fruit and oak seem to balance out the astringency in a way that will make it a great match with rich, meaty dishes.
The wine seems soapy and out of focus. It's soft while missing fruit. The acidity and freshness at the end are the best parts.
The grapes are partially severed from the vine, then left to dry prior to harvest. The result is a medium-bodied dessert wine that has become an Australian classic, with intense pineapple and citrus flavors that echo through the long, balanced finish. Imported by USA Wine West.
Crisp, dry, light wine, its freshness coming from redcurrant fruits. A gentle caramel overlay gives extra weight.
The red-berry aromas and flavors suffer from a tinge of bell peppers. The herb accents, decent fruit-to-acid balance and nice earthiness on the finish are all positive, but the vegetal cast keeps this otherwise solid wine from being more than good.
This is a little too heavy and full bodied, but it's bone dry and rich in blackberry and currant flavors, with an earthiness that suggests mushrooms. Drink over the next year or two.
Highlighted in Rainier cherry and cassis fruit, with a core of high acidity, this is a drinkable, affordable red wine worth looking for.
This New Mexico Mourvèdre has a deep, soulful profile with aromas of blackberry and spice and mouthfilling flavors of blackberry and vanilla toast. Soft but lingering, the wine is an elegant, food-friendly choice.
From vineyards 600 meters above sea level comes a Chard with white peach and mineral notes at its core. On the nose, they're dressed up in a subtle dose of burnt sugar; on the palate, they're backed up with vanilla and floral notes. Soft and even a little oily in feel. 20,000 cases produced. Imported by Cumulus Wines Inc.
Underbrush, spiced plum, vanilla and French oak are some of the aromas you'll find on this full-bodied red. The dense palate offers dried black cherry, toast, coconut, licorice and oak-driven spice alongside round tannins. A walnut note closes the finish. Drink soon.

Here's a real Champagne curiosity, wine made from six grape varieties. Apart from the usual three (Pinot Noir, Chardonnay and Pinot Meunier), there are Pinot Blanc, Petite Meslier and Arbanne, a variety that is almost extinct. All are permitted under Champagne rules.

Winemaker Michael McCay considers this white a field blend, listing Vermentino, Verdelho, Muscat and an improbable dollop of Pinot Noir as the varieties.

Hendry Vineyard Zinfandels are among Napa's best. With this release, Rock Wall brings their high alcohol, lusty touch to the wine. It's a huge Zin, dry and tannic, with ripe blackberry, dark chocolate and crushed black peppercorn flavors. Drink it now and through 2021.

Although it is labeled as Extra Brut, the ripeness of the fruit keeps this wine from being too shockingly dry. Instead, the pure green and ripe apple fruits are allowed to shine in a textured character that is crisp and fresh at the end.
This is declassified ice wine, picked frozen. It does not have the depth of the other dessert wines from Viento, but it is a remarkable effort, textural and delicate, with threads of straw, honey, cracker, candied tropical fruits and more, but all in a light and delicate style. This could easily become a wine that will amaze people in a blind tasting given the price.

This is serious and concentrated, probably built to age a few more years before its peak.

All of the best barrels are in here, and it shows. This limited (75 case) Bordeaux blend is wonderfully concentrated with sweet, stiff, sappy fruit, Juicy in the mouth, but tightly wound, it is fleshed out with buttery oak flavors of vanilla, toast and caramel.

Hugely dense, foursquare wine with great fruit and the purest tannins. Chocolate and coffee predominate at the same time as sweet tannins and acidity. A wine that combines charm with great power.

Lots to like in this smooth, polished Chardonnay. It shows plenty of ripe pineapple, peach and pear flavors, with overtones of vanilla and buttered toast. Good price for the quality.

Fully dry and elegant in structure, with fine acidity and dusty tannins, it offers a wealth of cola, cherry pie, mushu plum sauce, cinnamon and cardamom spice flavors. Will easily develop over the next eight years.
This very limited production reserve was fermented and aged sur lie in a concrete egg. Egg-zactly what that did for the flavor remains a mystery. It conveys crisp flavors of green berry, green apple and pear.
Medium bodied and fresh-tasting, this well-balanced wine emphasizes its apple and lemon flavors without much oak intervention. It has refreshing acidity and a clean finish.
Light (for Sineann) and almost delicate, but expressive and delightful, with lovely fruit displaying highlights of peach, cherry and hard candy. Broadly appealing, with a lick of light chocolate in the finish.
A light colored, Pinot Noir-dominated wine, with soft tannins, flavors of red plum skins and soft, ripe, strawberry jam. It has a round structure although it definitely tastes cool climate with light flavors and texture.
This wine from Benjamin Silver is peaking right now, with fascinating aromas of exotic red fruits, sesame oil, maple syrup, hoisin sauce, Korean BBQ spareribs and smoked, coffee-crusted meats. It's in your face on the palate too, with pomegranate and rhubarb ripeness mixing into espresso and meatiness.
Owned by the Quiot family of Châteauneuf-du-Pape, this is one of a pair of wines produced from the region of Sainte-Victoire. It is a full and fruity wine, rich with raspberries and freshened by final grapefruit acidity.
Very structured, with strong new wood flavors and black currant fruit. The wine feels relatively light, almost fresh, while also having considerable tannins and dryness.
Pretty scents and flavors suggest raspberry jam and blueberry compote; then some rather scrapey acids and stiff tannins kick in. The excellent fruit is there to begin, but it quickly turns one dimensional and finishes tannic and stemmy.
There's a strong herbal backbone to the core of this wine, surrounded by fleshy notes of melon and white peach. The earthy notes mix with a lime rind freshness on the palate, with a nice tropical fruit flavor that stays well into the close. Drink now.
Straddling richness and beautiful liveliness, this is going to be an impressive wine. It does need aging. At this stage, the wood is a big element, but then the bright white fruits—pears, white currants along with tangerines—will move center stage. Keep at least six years, almost certainly more.
Beautifully made, complex and complete, this full-bodied wine embraces seductive, spicy oak flavors, ripe fruit and a mouthfilling texture. Intricate vanilla, nutmeg and toasted baguette aromas lead to mulled plum, rhubarb and red-cherry flavors that coat the palate and linger on the finish.
Showing the structure of the vintage, while missing some of the flesh. The wine has a dry, firm and tannic core that hides the red fruit flavors. The wine, still on the austere side, will be ready to drink in a year.
Reflecting the structure and fruit of the 2010 vintage, the wine has dry tannins that are balanced by juicy black fruits and fine acidity. Drink from 2017.
Despite excellent vineyard sources, this is overripe for my palate, with flavors that are pruney and soft, and lacking definition and authority. It's soft and mysteriously weightless, with figgy fruit and a quick finish.
Dominated by Aragonez and Syrah, this is a fresh, fruity wine, tasting of delicious red fruits, light acidity, soft tannins. An earthy edge adds vigor.
Earthy with subtle Asian spice and forest floor scents, this wine is medium in build and generous in tannin, still untangling its limbs in the glass.
This wine is pale pink in color, with aromas suggesting herbs, cherry and red apple. It drinks off dry and is an easy-drinking porch pounder.
A mature Champagne, this shows as much toast and cookie character as fruit, making it soft, ripe and delicious. The fruit moves toward tropical, with pineapple and peach flavors. It is not a wine to age.
A smooth-textured wine that shows some ripe Merlot, firm fruit tannins and soft spice. There is an edge of wood, but the fruit is bright enough to cope. It should develop well into a rich wine.
Rounded and smooth, this wine has fine acidity to go with its black plum and herbal flavors. The fruit is full in the mouth, richly spiced, while also textured with dusty tannins. Worth aging, but deliciously juicy now.
A blend of Roupeiro, Perrum and Antão Vaz, this is a wine that shows how crisp and fresh (and light) whites from the hot Alentejo can be. There's simple, fresh, crisp fruit, with green plum and tropical fruit flavors, just great for chilling and drinking.
This is a soft, gentle wine, made for immediate consumption. It features bright cherry and pear-drop aromas and pleasant, if somewhat simple, fruit flavors. Two-thirds Grenache, with the rest being a blend of Syrah, Carignan, Cinsault and Mourvèdre.

The Warre's style is for unfiltered Late Bottled Vintages, which means they are can age in bottle. This wine, now released at 12 years is a case in point. In richness and in structure it is more like a fast aging Vintage Port. It is full of dark fruits, dense tannins and great concentration. A very fine wine, it is ready to drink.
This juicy wine is full of ripe, open fruit that makes it drinkable when young. It offers spice as well as rounded strawberry fruits that have just enough acidity. Drink now.
All white fruit, lemon and grapefruit, soft and with a hint of softness. It's a fine apéritif wine, right up front and friendly. Screwcap.

This untamed, boisterous wine has aromas like herbs and cola leading to powerful grapy, berrylike flavors and an assertive, grainy texture.
This is a light, clear and candied wine, somewhat thin, that's also tangy in acidity. Also holding 5% Zinfandel and 5% Sangiovese, it's definitely fruity in cherry and vanilla without getting overripe, a good value made by longtime winemaker Dr. Richard Peterson.
Heady aromas of blackberry, licorice, raisin and prune are at max ripeness but don't go overboard. That's the theme of this Catalan blend of known and local grapes including Carignan and Garnacha. Bold yet bright on the palate, this deals a full-throttle, toasty mix of root beer, mocha and blackberry flavors. Additional notes of chocolate, toast and spice drive the finish and complete the package. Drink through 2023.
Blackberry, oak and a light dusting of spice all make for a pleasant but common bouquet, while the palate is full of ripe but sterile black fruit, acidity and not a whole lot else. This is rock solid. Imported by Excelsior Wine & Spirits.
An intriguing headiness of red cherry promises an unadulterated purity of fruit. On the palate there is pepper, too, and more of that ripe, red cherry. This is fruit-forward, refreshing and simple but at the same time very balanced, fresh-faced and wonderfully authentic: Its honesty shines alongside the pure cherry fruit.
A low intensity wine with simple fruit flavors of berry and plum and a slight effervescence in the mouth.
Generous and inviting notes of peach and yellow plum make for an exuberant, almost festive, nose. The palate is equally rich with generous stone fruit: peach, plum and mirabelle plum. A spike of lemony freshness provides a balance on the frothily fresh palate. Full marks for fruit and joy.
A really nice wine that shows how well Sauvignon Blanc can grow in Livermore Valley. The wine is completely dry and quite tart in acidity, and the lemon, lime, tropical fruit and grassy flavors are enriched with notes of vanilla and buttered toast.
A little toasty but not too much, with apple, pear and other standard New World aromas. The palate is smooth, tropical and easygoing, with buttery, warm flavors of melon and apple. Holds it together on the finish.
Aromas of cherry, raspberry and a whiff of mint lead to flavors of dried cherry, raspberry and strawberry in this easy quaffing Pinot Noir.
Burnt slightly acrid aromas lead to a grabby palate. This tastes more salty than fruity, while a note of spent lees creates a wheaty flavor. A low fruit quotient is contiguous from nose to palate to finish.
Cherry and raspberry aromas are spunky and simple in front of a crisp edgy palate. Medicinal, lightly rubbery flavors of cherry and plum finish with a raw rub, juicy acidity, a lean body and mild heat.
While more mineral than fruit-forward on the nose, this pretty, dry Riesling is quite yielding, suggesting ripe, rich pink grapefruit and white peach on the palate. It's feather light but silky in texture, balanced by a strike of lemon acidity that lingers on the finish.
Peachy has long produced an Old School House Zin, but this is the first OSH Cab I know of. Like the Zin, it's a warming, rustic, friendly wine, awash in blackberry, dark chocolate, coffee and sweet oregano flavors, bone dry and finely tannic.
A blend of Braucol and Tannat, this a dark-colored blockbuster, with firm tannins that are mitigated by the smooth, rich blackberry flavor. It has power, immense concentration and great density. Age for 3–4 years.
Smoky, cedary and, frankly, a bit dominated by oak. It's nice oak, and the fruit is rich in body and thick in texture, just slightly muted. Perhaps an additional year or two of cellaring will see the oak integrate more and the fruit come forward.
Cheesy tomato-based aromas are rubbery and fiery. This feels lean and monotone. Stewed, salty flavors of earthy berry fruits are off base and dirty, while this is cheesy tasting on the finish.
This Cab shows the firm tannins and concentrated fruit of Atlas Peak, combined with the modern style of soft approachability. It's rich in blackberry and cherry pie flavors, with a generous overlay of sweet oak. Seems too sweet and one-dimensional for aging, so drink it now and through 2015 for freshness.
This wine has structure and strong old-wood flavors. It comes from the most southerly Premier Cru in the Côte de Beaune, close to the Chalonnaise vineyards. The fruit is still working its way through the tannins of this firm wine. It will have a juicy red-berry character as it develops, giving the potential for aging. Drink from 2018.
Aromas recall yellow pear and tropical fruit together with a touch of vanilla. The palate offers pineapple, citrus zest and Golden Delicious apple alongside bright acidity.

Young and impressive for its size and balance, despite some hefty tannins, this wine won't come into its own for a while. The ripecore of blackberry and black cherry fruit is big enough to suggest cellaring. Hold until 2007 and beyond.
Hats off to the Zonin family for being among the first to offer a Viognier from southern Tuscany. This shows the thick viscosity that is characteristic of the variety, with floral notes of violets and lemon blossoms. There's a dusty touch of mineral or brimstone on the finish.
A dirty nose spoils this otherwise attractive, easy, crisp Chablis. The palate has some notes of yeast and bright white fruit, with a citrusy finish.
A compelling effort, stylish and dark, this has a crisp minerality that underpins fruit flavors of black cherry, fig and plum. The texture, length and definition are first-rate.
Full-fruited plum notes tinged with cinnamon lend a touch of warmth and generosity to the nose of this wine. The palate holds these them tight in a fresh, citrusy embrace. It's medium bodied and harmoniously balanced, with a moreish tension, fine tannins and long-lasting freshness.
Here is what all the excitement is about:  a Washington Syrah bursting with dense, thick, textured, rich, ripe fruit, yet not too “jammy.” The acids are there to support all that weight, along with generous amounts of oak. The zippy, berry-laden fruit shines through, then the oak kicks in with an abundance of smoke, coffee and licorice notes. Big, sappy, sensuous and flat-out sensational wine. Editors' Choice.
Solid and dense, this shows the structure and concentration from the famed Côte du Py in Morgon. It has a lot of tannins at the moment, although the potential of the red berry fruit and acidity is evident. Age this for four years.
Ripe- and fresh-smelling--peach-like, with overtones of pink grapefruit. Plump and slightly viscous in the mouth, offering pink grapefruit and melon flavors. A bit low in acid, likely a result of the tremendously hot vintage, but still tasty.
96-98 Barrel sample. Concentrated and dense, this is a wine that fits well into the power of 2009. There is richness, but as well there is great elegance, a great structure of richness and sweetness, with the final bite of honey.
A neutral nose leads onto an apple-fresh palate of Golden Delicious and pearmain apples. There is a creamy aspect, bathing this in a softer, friendly light. Both crisp and rounded apple fruit charms throughout on this balanced Morillon, a local term for Chardonnay.
Buttered black cherries and olallieberries mix with snapped dark chocolate and crushed peppercorns on the nose of this blend of 62% Syrah, 14% Grenache, 12% Zinfandel, 4% Touriga Nacional, 4% Tinta Cao, 2% Bastardo and 2% Alicante Bouschet. The palate shows lots of brick and earth, with sagebrush, licorice and pomegranate-hibiscus flavors.
Cabernet Sauvignon comprises 95% of the blend, along with 5% Merlot.

There's a lot of new oak. Drink now–2018.
Gorgeous, rich Pinot flavors float over soft, ripe tannins. Strawberry-fruit flavors offer freshness and bright acidity. The dense texture is very evident, layered with wonderfully perfumed flavors from wood and fruit.
A fleshy, big-boned Pinot Noir from high-elevation grapes, Brassfield is priced fairly and a nice wine full of cranberry and leather, intense and coarsely textured.
A bit heavy in body, and very extracted, this single-vineyard Pinot from Boonville has jammy flavors of cherries, raspberries and currants. Extensive new oak adds layers of caramelized meringue. Tasty, although a bit obvious, the wine should hold its own for 5 years.
This opaque, fully extracted blend of Malbec, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon smells outright grapy, with a spunky pomegranate note. A syrupy laziness to the palate and jammy blackberry flavors finish chewy, with a leaning towards Concord grape. Tasted twice with similar findings.
From the Messina area in northern Sicily, this is a 50-50 blend of Nero d'Avola and Nerello Mascalese that bursts with bright berry freshness. The finish is clean, bright and tight.
This wine comes from a single vineyard in the heart of the appellation. It is soft, just hinting at the lime acidity while focused on ripe yellow and green-plum fruits. This wine can develop further and will be at its best from 2017.
Light and simple on the nose, with peach and flower blossom notes. The palate has some zip to it but not a whole lot, while the flavors are your basic mix of peach and nectarine. Zesty on the finish and then it evaporates. Drink now.
Tender notes of elderflower fill the nose with an almost confected note. The palate is fresh, crisp and clean with the same aromatic swing. A summer wine to be drunk as soon as possible for fragrant refreshment.
This unique Ripasso is heavily characterized by a smoky mineral tone or ashy note that lends a sensation of finesse and dryness to the overall picture. There is red fruit too, but mostly in the aftertaste.
This generous and full-bodied wine is full of juicy red berry fruits, ripe tannins and just enough structure to support its opulent character. Wood aging gives a fine-grained texture that will allow it to age. Drink from 2016.

This wine offers fragrances of vanilla, cherry and cherry cola. A fruity palate of cherry and black plums is backed by soft notes of vanilla and a core of satiny tannins.
Ripe, juicy and fragrant, this has a delicious red berry flavor that is ready to give pleasure. Maybe it's not a wine for long-term aging, but keep it for at least for 4–5 years.
The Celilo vineyard has contributed the fruit to many outstanding Chardonnays from a who's who list of winemakers, but none better than this. Intensely concentrated and deeply extracted, it explodes with marvelously pure fruit flavors—the full range of citrus, citrus peel and crisp tree fruits. A wine with perfect virtually balance, exceptional texture and amazing length.

Pommery's prestige Champagne is named after one of the great Champagne widows of the 19th century who took over when her husband, Alexandre Pommery, died.

You'll find strong flavors of grilled blackberries and black cherries, tobacco, unsweetened baker's chocolate and black pepper in this dry, tannic wine. Made from Syrah, Mourvèdre and Counoise, it's rustic and high in alcohol. Makes you think of beef tacos.
New wood aromas give minty character to this wine. The palate is dominated by that wood, which covers the fruit and just leaves structure. Considering that the wine is now five years old, this imbalance will probably remain.
This is one of the most expensive Cabernet Sauvignons ever from Paso Robles, but the truth is that it expresses a new, emerging style from that region of balance and complexity. Made from 100% Cab, it's dry, full bodied and balanced, although a little conspicuous in alcohol. The black currant flavors are powerful and delicious. Drink soon.

Simple, off-dry, and very much in the style of the Riesling. The blend includes 9% Muscat Canelli. It's basically a fruity, somewhat sweet tasting room wine.

Unacceptably harsh and hot with overripe raisiny flavors and charred oak notes. It's like cheap Port with some sweetness.
Densely tannic and deep in flavor, this full-bodied wine should continue to develop nicely because two days after opening, it was still terrific. It leads with anise and charcoal aromas, settling on dark chocolate-covered cherry flavors, while its firm, dry mouthfeel holds it all together. Best after 2022.
The red plum and cassis aromas are meaty and oak-laden and carry to the smoky palate. This simple wine shows firm tannins and good acids, finishing with a toasty herbal note.
Unattractive, with funky, medicinal cherry flavors and a soft, collapsed texture. The oak sticks way out.
Soft and round, this is a wine that has the warmth of the Alentejo coupled with a tangy, fresh slice of lemon. Blending Antão Vaz, Roupeiro and Perrum, it's a wine to drink now, or just age for a few months.
Spicy wood notes, dark fruit, rum cake, dried ginger, licorice and cola add up to an ethereal and elegant Brunello that is more smooth and silky than it is bold and bulky. Spice, sandalwood and cedar appear on the close, but it has a compact, streamlined structure.
Smells oxidized, as if it's dying. The palate is bland in feel and the flavors suggest fermented orange juice. Not hideous but uninspired; shows only a modicum of citrus character and pulse.
A nice, highly affordable bottling that highlights Argentina's value potential. The palate is soft, almost silky, with melted tannins and full flavors of raspberry and ripe plums. There's even some toasty warmth to the finish. A textbook easy rider.

This big, earthy wine has aromas of ripe black plum, tilled soil, leather and coffee. The palate shows blackberry, prune marinated in sprits and black pepper alongside tightly woven and assertive tannins.
The Freedom Hill is the biggest of all the Ken Wright Pinots, except possibly the Shea. Tannic and leathery, this has a distinct streak of coffee grounds running all through it. Gutsy and potentially the longest lived.
Dusty and warm up front, this has baked apple and peachy aromas. It feels round with only mild acidity, while the flavors yield barrel resin, citrus and sweet melon. It's not too evolved on the finish.
This GSM blend is oak-forward, with charred black and red berries meeting dark coffee on the nose and palate. Medium bodied with a mild tannic grip, enjoy alongside a coffee-rubbed rib eye.
Tempranillo brings its signature delicacy, acidity and cherry fruit. Syrah contributes the weight, black pepper, tannins and, in this case, a cool-climate note of roasted meat. The result is a beautiful and versatile wine, complex and dry, that will go with just about anything calling for a medium-bodied red.
This smooth, tasty, very well-balanced wine glides over the palate and tastes like Bing cherry spiced with cinnamon and nutmeg. Fresh acidity and fine, firm tannins support the flavors well and keep the wine appetizing and mouthwatering, even in the aftertaste.

A tang of salty minerals extends throughout this sublime spätlese. Intensely fruity, its sweet white-peach and mango flavors seem to fall on the tongue in crystalline shards. Light-footed and vibrantly acidic, it's a superbly balanced wine that drinks well now but should improve through 2024 and beyond.
The aromas are light, with notes of baking spice and black and blue fruit. Tart cherry flavors linger on the finish.
Structured and dark-hued, this powerful wine is dense with tannins as well as black cherry fruits. It is initially tough, but behind the solid exterior lies a warmer wine, full of delicious fruit waiting to come out. Drink from 2018.
An amalgam of pastry crust, mint, and mixed wild-berry aromas lead on the nose. Medium to full in body, this sports firm, brittle tannins and lax acids. It finishes with traces of vanilla and dried herbs.
Apart from Columbia's Otis Cab, this is Yakima's (and Washington's) oldest Cabernet vineyard. Newer plantings of Merlot and Cab Franc enhance the blend. The wine is marked by its finesse and exceptional grace. Silky and sensuous, it's a wine that warrants the old-fashioned term “breed”—suggesting manapricot-scented lemon and lime flavors are tinged with peaches, wildflowers and nered elegance. Cherry, bramble berry, plummy fruit and exotic spices light up the finish.
A salmon-infused slate color, this wine starts off gently with a nice yeast aroma. Citrus flavors interact with light boysenberry, again with a soft overlay of yeast. Crisp, with nice body and good bubbles, this is balanced and delicious.
A good, everyday sort of Zin, dry and fruity. It has a rich tannic structure, with spicy cherry, tangerine, currant, cola and cocoa flavors.

The wine is not overdone or over extracted and you'll appreciate the touches of cherry, blackberry and natural rubber. It wins more points in the mouth thanks to its power and determination.
The 2008 Noemía wines all seem a little sedate and short compared to prior years. This wine is dark, crusty and tarry on the nose, with requisite black fruit and a slightly soupy quality. The palate is full and chewy, with medium-intensity black fruit and chocolate flavors. Finishes short, without much velocity.
The village of Gamlitz is dominated by the Kranachberg vineyard. The example from Sattlerhof shows the natural tropical richness from the warm soils. There is a herbal character to go with the more spicy, fruity. A mineral texture at the end gives bite. Glass stopper.
Zesty lemon paired with riper tropical notes of pineapple counter the racy acidity of this full-flavored wine. This takes time to open up but the intense palate is worth the wait. So serious it should be had with food.
There's a touch of dried apple skin or volatility that masks some of the wine's aromas of forest berry and pipe tobacco. The mouthfeel is fresh and there's subtle firmness too thanks its polished tannins.
This is a lush Syrah, smooth and rich in blackberry jam, milk chocolate and sandalwood flavors, with sprinkles of pepper and anise. So fruity, it's almost sweet, but the finish is clean and dry. Drink now.
The liquorous old gold color of this wine indicates the long barrel aging. It is rich with spice, dried fruits and old wood flavors all finely interwoven. The wine, which originated in a field blend of old vines, has a final shot of acidity to bring it to life.
Succulent in white peach, pear and apple, this is a nicely balanced, pretty wine. It offers just the right amount of richness on the palate, with a swirl of vanilla caramel suggested in the background amid an intriguingly unexpected salty, pretzel-like finish.
Soft ctirus notes appear first. The palate follows with gentle but focused mandarin peel and a bright, luminous core of citrus freshness and weightlessness. Nonetheless, this wine offers a depth of citrus fruit with clear focus and precision. This is lovely, pure and lasting.
Aromas of dried strawberry and cherry preserves brighten notes of toasted oak and dried herbs in this wine. The palate is crisp and youthful, with red cherry flavor, and a slightly bitter edge that adds depth and dimension. Soft, chalky tannins linger on the warming finish.
While delicate in bouquet for Muskateller, aeration brings out pretty whiffs of blossom, basil and gooseberry in this slightly off-dry white. Overripe, slighty ruddy melon and lychee flavors are a bit clumsy, but bright acidity brightens the finish. Drink now.
Big, yet creamy in texture and refined, with plenty of silky tannins to frame the superripe black cherry fruit. Just lacks a little complexity, but still a very good, juicy mouthful of fruit and oak. Drink now–2013.
The caramel character of this wine is less attractive than its background of red fruits. The two sides need to come into balance for it to work completely, so wait until late 2016.
This new version of Tildio's Profundo is 90% Cabernet Sauvignon, the rest Merlot, with a mix of sweet herb and grass, blueberry fruit, and streaks of iodine or licorice. After a big, fruity opening, it falls away in the middle and turns a little bit harsh and green in the finish. Some cinnamon highlights from aging in 80% new French oak add interest.
Chunky aromas are lacking in fruit. The palate feels pithy and citric, while pyrazines and bland citrus drive the flavor profile on this Verdejo-Viura blend that's past its prime.
Savory spice and roasted meat aromas lead into flavors of tomato, olives and roasted meat. The wine has a brisk acidity and a smoky finish, making it perfect for grilled burgers, steaks and sausages.
This well priced wine offers typical Shiraz aromas and flavors, ranging from cherries to black olives and weaving in some smoky and tarry accents. It's medium-bodied, with a plump feel but also a firmly tannic backbone that would serve it well alongside steak, chops or burgers.
The dark color and crusty, wood-based aromas reflect a slathering of oak that comes across sort of lemony, but there's no denying that this Cab has body, tannin and heft. It's a little burnt and heavy on the nose and palate, but black fruit and brown sugar flavors give it enough richness to bring it up a notch.
A blend of 60% Shiraz and 40% Cinsault, this is a well-balanced and attractive wine. It offers up hints of black tea, bergamot and turned earth that grace the black plum and berry core. Medium tannins lend a framing structure to the ripe fruit flavors, finishing on whispers of pencil lead and toasted oak.
Streamlined, citric freshness dominates every delicious aspect of this wine: the fresh, zingy nose, the ripe and supremely juicy palate with its swirls of both ripe and tart apples, and the extended finish. This is mouth-watering stuff. It's cushioned but extremely sleek, apple-fruity, very moreish and so very pure.
This Merlot-Cab Sauvignon smells and tastes like tomato juice, with balsam and tobacco accents. Smooth tannins offer a creamy feel, but high acid makes it tart.
Delicate scents suggesting aromatic herb, citrus blossom and a whiff of orchard fruit come together on this. The palate is round but rather shy, offering notes of mature yellow apple, honey and bitter almond.
Dark, full and very oaky on the nose, this extracted Malbec is ripe and toasty smelling. Tannic, stacked and chewy in the mouth, with flavors of roasted blackberry, raw oak, chocolate and clove, this finishes with a ton of unabsorbed oak and related flavors of clove and mint.
A zesty wine, its fragrances suggest stone fruit, cut grass, pineapple and a mineral note. The bright, lively palate delivers yellow peach, papaya and citrus alongside a steely mineral note and crisp acidity.
A good wine in many respects, but it has dry, astringent tannins that make it feel harsh and sticky. The cherry and blackberry flavors are ripe and somewhat medicinal.
This is a tonic and fresh Prosecco Brut with pretty aromas of peach and pear backed by fragrant lemon, orange blossom and a tiny touch of chopped basil. The nose is extremely polished and pure with a very attractive mineral dimension.
This comes out swinging, with bullish berry and prune aromas that hint at being stewy but then pull back. It's saturated and tannic but not rough, with black fruit, chocolate, toast and pepper flavors. Minty and dark, with a licorice note on the finish. Drink now–2016.
Firm dark-berry aromas come with cola and leafy notes that feel tannic and gripping but alive. Big berry and black plum flavors are leafy and spicy in style. It finishes tight, but should open and relax with a bit of time in the glass, and would go well with pizza and burgers.
This wine offers an unusual combination of hot, jammy fruit backed by crisp acidity. Its aromas are big and bulky yet the mouthfeel is surprisingly fresh. Pair this wine with roasted duck or other fatty meats.
This is a structured wine, juicy with black-currant fruit and acidity. It will develop quickly, softening its tannins and filling out with ripe fruit. Drink from 2018.
An absolute pleasure to drink, especially with fresh pasta topped with grated Parmigiano cheese, this is a soft, yielding wine with mature pear, Golden Delicious apple, apricot and white stone. An attractive bouquet is followed by creamy consistency and good persistency.
Neutral aromas of dusty apple and peach are o.k. at best. Like most 2012 white wines from Chile, this seems heat-affected; the body is plump and heavy, while melon and citrus flavors finish soft and mealy.
Made from organically farmed grapes, this bright blend of Sangiovese (90%) and Merlot (10%) starts with aromas of violet, iris and freshly tilled soil. The lively palate delivers black cherry and raspberry flavors, while notes of cinnamon-spice add some depth. It's enjoyable now, but hold until 2016–2017 to round out.
Lots of elegance in this Cabernet. It's dry, full bodied and rich in tannins, with a good depth of black currants and sweet, toasty oak. Won't age, but who cares: Pop the cork and drink it now.

From the makers of Tuscany's legendary Sassicaia, this Carignano-Cabernet-Merlot Sardinian blend boasts sunshine within.

It's thick and firm in the mouth with bruising tannins and a long, tasty finish.
Beautifully balanced, this conveys both rich fruit and a tense, intense minerality. Combining the two strands impeccably, it brings out tangy apple and pink grapefruit flavors and a steely, tight acidity. It's a structured wine that needs to age. Drink from 2018.

This family estate, established since the 14th century, has produced a light, beautifully fruity wine in the difficult 2013 vintage. With red fruits and soft tannins, it is fully of ripe berry flavors cut by acidity.A light structure in the background will allow the wine to age, although it is ready to drink now.
Roasted coffee aromas are inviting on the nose of this Cabernet Sauvignon, blessed with 25% Cabernet Franc.

Broad shouldered, the wine is balanced with a jolt of minerality, suggesting cellaring through 2022–2027.
Rich and smooth, packed with strawberry and black berry flavors. It has weight as well, coming from a fine layer of wood, spice and solid tannins. There is great acidity, balancing well with the firm structure. For medium-term aging.
A full-boat, five-varietal Bordeaux blend. It's nicely balanced, and retains some inviting aromas of violets and candied rose petals, leading into a lip-smacking, fruit-driven mid-palate with blueberries, boysenberries and a whisper of saffron and chocolate. There is plenty of acid underpinning, and a judicious use of barrels that keeps the fruit front and center. The best yet from Tildio.
Made from traditional Bordeaux varieties plus Syrah, this is a soft, simple, fruity wine. The raspberry, cherry, cola and spice flavors finish a bit sweet. Drink now.

Here's a very successful and aromatic Pinot Grigio from cool-climate Trentino in northern Italy. A small percentage of the grapes undergo air-drying (appassimento) for extra heft and richness on the finish. Aromas include apricot, tropical fruit and a touch of white almond.
This is a woody, generously oaked white that's full and relatively fleshy, with a perception of ripe sweet fruit and vanilla.

Jammy, roasted aromas are more savory and offbeat than common and fruity. This Malbec has a fresh but choppy mouthfeel and flavors of tomato, basil and herbal berry fruits. A savory finish conforms with the rest of the wine.
This firmly tannic blend of 50-50 Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon is still developing. While its juicy black currant fruits are right there, it needs another few years to soften the dry, hard-edged tannins and minerality. The juicy acidity at the end promises the wait will be worth it.
Cabernet Sauvignon (73%) makes up the majority of this wine, with the rest filled out by Merlot (15%), Petit Verdot (8%) and Cabernet Franc. Anise, woodspice and herb aromas are at the fore, leaning a bit into the green. The palate is light and elegant, with the tannins bringing a fair amount of grittiness. It needs some food to keep them in check.
Slightly herbal in character—not surprising given that it's 70% Cabernet Franc, an unusual variety for the Gard. Those leafy notes persist from start to finish, balanced out hints of peach and raspberry. Easy to drink.
This limited offering, based upon a portion of 35-year-old vines, shows a chewy mix of red fruits that are rather bright and spicy. It's a bit reductive (and screwcaps can bring that out), with hints of plastic, that will need aggressive decanting.
Black plum, blue flower, oak, espresso and chocolate aromas waft from the glass of this densely structured wine. The palate delivers blueberry extract, roasted coffee bean, vanilla and spice alonside tightly packed wood tannins that generate an astringent, mouth-drying finish. Give it time to unwind. Drink 2018–2030.
This deceptive Pinot, from one of Oregon's newly-coined AVAs, enters with light cranberry and strawberry flavors, but keeps piling on nuances. First it adds in some baking spice, hints of cardamom and caroway, then seems to gain in weight and strength as it sails across the palate. The fruit moves into layers of plum and sour cherry, and the toasty tannins add still more depth to the elegant finish. Lovely effort in an elegant style.
This straightforward wine brings vanilla, citrus and toasted wood to the forefront, with interesting whiffs of petrol as well. It's still tightly wound for a white wine, so waiting until 2016 may reveal more magic.

Produced in eastern Alentejo, near Spain, this light and soft wine is easy and drinkable. It has a smooth texture, just hinting at lemony acidity. Drink now.
This blend of many vineyard lots seems less than the sum of its parts. Pungently herbal with characteristic Oregon tomato leaf tannins, its fruit remains hidden beneath the tannins. Age may enhance its beauty, but for the moment it remains tight and unyielding, with suggestions of heat around the cranberry/pomegranate fruit.
This is a milky, dark and deeply concentrated Barbera with soapy, floral notes and loads of blueberry and blackberry at the back. The quality of the fruit is sweet and chewy and although there is bright acidity here, the closing note delivers a blast of black cherry. A great value too.
Sweet, toffee aromas lead to an equally sweet wine. It has richness, a very smooth, soft texture that coats the mouth with toffee, treacle and only a hint of blackberry fruits. Dried fruits come through in the aftertaste.
It's rare to find a pure varietal example that all comes from a single site. This one offers aromas of flowers, moist soil, purple fruit and exotic spice followed by a dense, almost impenetrable palate that offers freshness and length. It's a standout example of the variety.
This has been a good bottling for Brassfield. It shows classic mountain intensity, with explosive currant, wild berry, mocha, pine cone, anise and pepper flavors, tucked into firm, sweet tannins. Could benefit from 2 or 3 years in the cellar.
Plenty of oak, which must be why it's called “Gran Reserva.” Along with the lumber you'll find chocolate, marinade and pickle. Fat on the palate, with bulky black plum and blackberry flavors. Licorice, coffee and green bean notes define the finish.
This is a likeable Syrah for drinking now. It has soft acids and tannins that frame notes of jammy cherry and blackberry. The flavors are sweet on the midpalate, but finish dry and spicy.
Tight, pure and just right from start to finish. The nose offers bold berry, roasted plum, vanilla and spice aromas along with exceptional clarity, and the palate is snappy and pure but also dark and loaded with coffee, chocolate, mocha and fine raspberry and cherry flavors. Slightly oaky but smooth late, and composed. Drink now through 2014.
Light in hue, featuring delicate cherry and crushed spice aromas and flavors that lean toward black pepper. It's on the light side, but still attractive, and would work well with delicate salmon preparations. Imported by Vincor USA.
Damp, foresty earth aromas meet those of cherry and dusty cocoa, which carry to the palate of lightweight red fruit. The balance of smooth tannins and gentle acidity is pleasant, but there is room for more heft and complexity overall in this wine.

A little rubbery at first, but then it unfolds with floral, blackberry and tar aromas. Fairly dynamic in terms of feel, with elevated red-fruit flavors balanced by oak and chocolate.

Muscular and dark for a $10 red, with aromas of herbs, olive and black fruits. The feel is tight and linear but clean, with grapey, lightly herbal flavors of blackberry and dark plum. Spice and licorice notes grace the juicy finish. Solid wine for the price.

Red-fruit aromas come with a hint of animal, something that's not uncommon to Bobal. An expansive palate is mildly abrasive, while chunky plum flavors end with heat and skins-driven bitterness

Beneath the surface tannins is great Merlot fruit, very ripe and full-bodied, a powerhouse of flavors. The depth and complexity of the wine is all there, along with a dark core of dryness. A wine for long-term aging.

Imported by Pivotal Inc.

A good value, this starts off a little shaky thanks to some barnyard scents on the nose, then rights itself. Herbal-tobacco notes accent plum-prune flavors in this medium-bodied wine with a creamy-smooth texture. Soft and easygoing, it's ideal to drink now.

Tolosa may be the only vineyard to produce two unoaked Chardonnays in the same vintage. Their '11 Central Coast is quite good. This one, from estate Edna Valley fruit, is even better.

A lovely Viognier that shows the variety's exotic richness while maintaining dryness and elegance despite high alcohol. The tropical fruit, wildflower, spice and honey flavors are deliciously balanced with crisp acidity.

The full-bodied, elegant palate offers crushed blackberry, succulent morello cherry, licorice and tobacco alongside a backbone of taut, fine-grained tannins. Drink 2018 through 2027.
Pronounced Kay-lee, this is the most tannic of the Syrahs from Efeste-. Forward black fruit flavors are wreathed in smoke, and there is plenty of supporting acidity. This finishes with a burst of cherry.
The differences between a good fino and a great fino are usually slight, but this one has pretty much all one could ask for. The nose is crisp, with hints of sea breeze, peanut and tart apple showing through. In the mouth, there's snap, saline and mineral-laden white fruits. Nothing is out of bounds.

Heavy and dull, with candied flavors of cherries, cola, currants and chocolate. Gets the job done.

A simple, rustic wine. It shows Pinot's silky texture, with racy acidity and subtle cherry, pomegranate and cola flavors. But it's chunky and clunky in the mouth. Seems to contain some unripe grapes.
Rock-solid Tempranillo that wows with its richness and depth, but also shows a touch of ripeness-based sweetness that critics could see as candied and simple. But that's splitting hairs, and we prefer to compliment the wine's dynamite intensity and its rangy finish. Maybe a touch bigger and less complex than Fournier's AlfaSpiga, but still excellent. Imported by Fine Wines from Spain.
There's something about this lush Cab that keeps you reaching for more. It's soft and velvety, with just enough tannins to keep things perky, but best of all are the flavors. Blackberries and cherries, dusted with cocoa, sprinkled with a dash of cinnamon, and drizzled with crème de cassis. Yummy.

The ultimate patio/terrace wine has been found, and it's Urban from O. Fournier. True as can be, with lychee, acacia and green melon aromas and flavors, this wine is plump but refreshing, with honest Cafayate character. Maybe the best under-$10 white wine being made in Argentina.
Very thin and yet tannic at the same time, this Tempranillo shares some classic traits of the grape, from earthy cherry to tobacco, even a suggestion of rose water, but it's all fairly understated and quick to end.
Even with 8% residual sugar, this dessert Merlot tastes simple, like elderberry tea with a spoonful of white sugar.

Dense tannins find their way to roundness amid a smattering of red and blue berries and an intense shock of dried herb. The finish is a mix of leather pouch and brine.
Joseph Jewell's 2014s from remote Humboldt County are dazzling.

Medium body, vibrant acidity and firm but light tannins add to its appetizing character.

Wonderfully balanced and structured, this is a wine that gives a complete series of flavors from chocolate, black stone fruits, layers of wood and finally the essential acidity. Its texture is grainy, dusty, firm and ready to age for several years.
A jubilant bouquet of orange blossoms, marmalade and stony minerals, this unctuous ice wine is profoundly aromatic and complex.

Spicy, sweet and lavishly creamy, it lingers endlessly on the finish.
The word "black" applies to a number of things here: cherry, coffee, currant. Cola is another part of the fabulous mix. Tons of polish, and creamy and rich. A palate-pleaser supreme; there's a lot of class and breed here. Fine and fancy, with excellent weight. What more could you ask for?

This is an underripe stench bomb with pyrazines coming at you from every direction. The nose is like a bowl of cactus and nettle, while the palate is harsh. Flavors of bitter pithy grapefruit show all that can go wrong with this variety.
A bit soupy and soft on the nose, with mulch, oak and tobacco along with dark-fruit aromas. This marks the second vintage of Intriga, a new Maipo Valley Cabernet Sauvignon from MontGras, and it's full and chewy, with raspberry flavors and size.

The nose of dried fruits and spices also features cigar box and tomato, while the palate of red plum, cherry and tomato is mature. With some length and intensity to the finish, this is perfect to drink now.
An earthy, rubbery Pinot that's not likely to sway the drinker of Burgundy any closer to Chile. This is tart, bulky stuff with size and zero subtlety.

Very dry, by modern standards, and while there's a noble core of blackberrry and currant flavors, there's also terrific minerality—as if the dirt had been set afire and liquified. The firm tannins make this Cabernet-based blend hard. With such great structure, it's a likely cellar candidate. Drink after 2015.
Ripe and at the same time structured, this wine is as broad as its palate is long. It envelops the mouth with nutmeg and almonds as well as white fruits and ripe acidity. It's delicious now, but there's structure to allow it a few years aging.

A huge improvement from the overoaked, flawed 2007 Sibaris. This is still toasty and resiny like most Chilean Chards, but it's also smooth and thorough in the mouth, with orange, melon, vanilla and toast flavors. Unfolds nicely on the finish; very good for Maipo Chardonnay and, as stated, a far more balanced wine than the previous vintage.

Savory herb and smoke notes on the nose contrast this Riesling's rich, unctuously fruity palate full of peach and apricot jam.

Musky, herbaceous tones juxtapose against candied fruit flavors in this dry, sprightly wine. It's peachy, forward and simple, but fun for its carefree, flirtatious nature.
This wine is floral and spicy on the nose, but lacks the richness on the midpalate to fully support those ambitions. The result is a highly perfumed but modestly flavored wine with medium body and a dusty finish. Drink now.

Still holding its deep red color, this is otherwise a wine that is now mature and ready to drink, hailing from the first vintage of the Vadio Project.

What a pleasant surprise awaits you here: It's delectable, decadent and downright delicious.

While the acidity is intense, it is balanced by the ripe cherry fruits and soft tannins. This is not a wine for aging much beyond 2014, showing a bright, fresh aftertaste.
Oaky aromas of coconut, balsam wood and vanilla control the nose on this Cabernet blend that's raw, rugged, acidic, tannic and grating on the palate. Big biting flavors of plum, oak grain and vanilla finish with screechy acidity and snap. Drink through 2021.

Dark spice, ripe berry, forest floor, Mediterranean brush and new leather aromas lead the nose on this powerfully structured wine. On the full-bodied palate, baking spice, licorice and pipe tobacco notes accent a juicy black cherry core while firm, velvety tannins provide the framework. Drink 2020–2030.
Aromatic with soda pop scents of Dr. Pepper, cola and root beer, this is nonetheless a reasonably substantial wine, not a simple fruit bomb. It's lively and full of interesting flavors that suggest herb, root and spice; the wood remains a background flavor.
Almost too fruity, the wine has red berry fruits in profusion. What is missing is the tannin to hold it together, making this a fruity wine to drink soon.
This ancient Corsican grape, found only in small quantities on the island, has been offered the spotlight in this wine. It's soft, warm and rich in style, with plenty of spice and ripe pear and apricot flavors. Its crisp aftertaste is a fine contrast to the rich fruit. Drink now.
Another fabulous Cardinale, better than the 2007 but short of the perfect 2006. This is so complete; it tastes like Cabernet on a cloud, light but ethereal, with ripe, polished blackberry and cherry flavors and touches of mocha, spice and cedar. The tannins are a wonder—soft and pliant—yet gorgeously complex. Drink now-2016, at least.
Shows the crisp acidity of the coast, with the hedonistic ripeness of the vintage, to produce a pleasantly rich wine to drink now. Floods the mouth with raspberry, cherry, bacon, cola, pepper spice and sandalwood flavors.
Good price for an everyday Cab this savory. It's juicy in blackberries, cherries and peppery spices, wrapped into firm tannins.
Made in the rich, ripe, over-the-top style that winemaker Mark McNeilly uses for his own Mark Ryan Viogniers, this is a superconcentrated wine with more than a passing resemblance to limoncello. Along with that comes notes of Key lime, candied pineapple and a bit of alcoholic heat. Some will find it excellent, others a little too extravagant.
Aromas of blueberries, beef roast and fudge give way to a light, straightforward palate of purple fruit. It's a clean wine, but not very complex.
This wine exudes southern warmth with its rich, soft fruit and ripe tannins. Generous and opulent, it is packed with red and black berry fruits and already drinkable. The aftertaste with its juicy acidity gives the wine a lift.
An unusual blend of 80% Clairette and 20% Bourboulenc, this medium-bodied wine is crisp and citrusy, marked by pineapple and hints of underripe peach and pear. It's light enough to be paired with more delicate seafood dishes over the summer months.
This crisp and light Soave Classico cleans the palate thanks to its well-integrated acidity and streamlined feel. It's a fresh and easy-going alternative to Pinot Grigio that would pair just as successfully with chicken salad or Chinese take-out.
Offering considerable weight and depth of flavor, this Pinot, from one of the most respected vineyards in the appellation, offers mid-term aging prospects. Dry and spicy, it offers powerful flavors of grilled cherries, red currants, licorice, cola and smoky oak. Drink now through 2012.
Probably the best vintage of this wine yet, this is a medium-bodied Chardonnay, showing restrained oak and understated white peach. Elegant and subtle, it finishes on a gentle citrus note. Drink it over the next year or two.
This is quite a success for a 2000 Cab, probably due to the extreme mountain growing conditions. Although it is strong and even astringent in tannins, there is a sweet, flattering richness of cherry and blackberry fruit that is particularly evident on the long finish. It is an obvious cellar candidate. Drink 2008 and beyond.
This is a ripely tannic wine, made from fruit that was sourced from a parcel of more than 40-year-old vines. While it is certainly fruity, rounded and warm, it has tannins as well. It's a velvety wine that retains its structure. Age for the medium term.
Sweet, oak-like flavors of vanilla and caramel dominate this simple Merlot. Underneath is a candied wine, with pastry flavors of raspberries and cherries.
Understated on the nose, but there are some pretty hints of melon, spice and crushed stone. Light in body, with modest fruit flavors on the palate, but some finishing anise and clove.
Orchard fruit aromas and a whiff of toasted hazelnut lift out of the glass after a few swirls. The racy palate offers pear, apple and a mineral note alongside vibrant acidity. It finishes clean and crisp.
Narrow berry aromas are straightforward but not complex. This is a smooth operator with round tannins, plenty of body and a mix of black fruits, licorice, herbs and spices on the flavor profile. Flavors turn more herbal on the finish, where oregano and thyme accent tastes of cassis and berry.
A nice example of the '08 Pinots, just coming out, and the price is fair for a wine of this quality. Dry and silky, it shows good varietal flavors of cherries, cola, chocolate, sweet pomegranates and smoky oak, with a long, rich finish. Drink now.
Enhanced with polished notes of toasted nut and vanilla (the wine sees 12 month of barrique) this is a more austere Pinot Nero with delicate nuances of spice, blue fruit and white mushroom. The fruit comes from a high-density vineyard planted in 1991 with clay and rocky soils.
Red berry, cinnamon and vanilla mingle playfully in this personality-laden Cab. The combo of pretty and slightly wild flavors works well—and firm tannins and structure mean the wine will age nicely. Imported by Monsieur Touton.
Lees and oak dominate the nose of this very ripe wine. The result is size: A big, rich, oaky, fruity quaff, it fills the mouth with flavors and palate impressions. At the same time, it's a one-dimensional wine; it assaults the senses, but on one plane. Finishes semi-sweet.
Ripe and open on the nose, with lush blueberry aromas mixed with vanilla and tobacco. Feels medium to full but not heavy, with raspberry, red apple skin, coconutty oak and spice for flavors. Almondy and sweet on the finish, with handsome dry spice.
From vineyards close to Saint-Estèphe, this wine has something of the dark tannins and dry character when young. Ripe fruit under the chocolate, coffee and new-wood flavors shows the potential for aging. Drink from 2018.
Licorice, dark spice and berry pie right down to the buttery crust make for a decent nose. In the mouth, it's creamy and warm, with full-bodied plum and raisin flavors alongside a shot of acidity and chocolate on the finish. Not very complex but it delivers the basics.
Toast, underbrush, fragrant blue flower and woodland berry aromas lead the way. The firm palate offers tart red cherry, licorice and baking spice alongside fine-grained tannins that lend elegant structure. Drink 2018–2024.
This wine spent time in French, American and Hungarian oak, 25% of it new. It offers a classically herbal expression of the variety, exhibiting notes of black olive and leather over fruity tones. Tight and grippy, it needs to open over time to let the aromas catch up on the palate.
While there is an herbaceous element in this wine, it is more to do with ripe berry fruits. It has a tangy orange-zest character that is bright and fruity, along with the black-currant flavors that give the wine some good intensity.
Could be a Zinfandel, it's so full-bodied, rugged in tannins and peppery. The wild berry, tobacco and cedar flavors also are Zinny. A good wine, if not particularly illustrative of what Sangiovese can do in California.
Over the years this Rhône blend, based on Mourvédre, Grenache and Syrah, has been an excellent value, and the '05 is one of the best yet. Rich and soft, it's packed with opulent cherry and blackberry pie filling, cassis, red currant, licorice, pepper and smoke flavors, with a creamy, chocolaty taste throughout. Yet the wine is totally dry and balanced.
There's lots of ripe raspberry and cherry fruit in this Pinot, with a rich touch of smoky oak and vanilla. It's nice and light in the mouth, with brisk, mouthwatering acidity. A great wine for the price that's ready to drink now.
This ultrayoung wine is all fruit. It is textured with minerality and a chalky character that is keeping the fresh green fruits in balance. The wine is delicious, although really not ready. Better to wait until 2016.
Smoky, dried fruit-flavored wine. There is some sweetness, its ripe currant flavors boosted by a broad texture and some spice. The acidity seems to be missing.
Here's a Cabernet to lay down in the cellar for 6–8 years—or even longer. Two things mark it: the extremely ripe, concentrated blackberry and black currant fruit, and the hefty tannins. Most people will probably open it too soon and miss out on what it could be, when the tannins drop out to reveal its sweet fruity essence.
Flat boysenberry and plum aromas are jammy and a bit floral. This feels clipped and rugged, with reedy plum and raspberry flavors that finish short.
White stone fruits, some smoke and toast, and ample spice makes the entrance to this wine really inviting. There's plenty of richness to the mouth, which is jammed with lemon, lime and a balancing dryness not unlike chalk. The fade is pure and dry, offering long nuances of spicy oak and white pepper. It's a wine that's integrated and satisfying.
Beautiful aromas of creamy apple, white flower and ripe pear carry over to the bright delicious palate along with a hint of lemon zest. Crisp acidity lifts the lingering finish.
Third in Three Brothers' series of four Rieslings, this bottling is accurately labeled as semi-sweet, although certainly sweeter than the 1st Degree. There's a consistency through the series with a savory nose of anise, fennel and petroleum. The mouth is full of ripe fruit—this time juicy honeydew and tangerines—and a hint of jasmine tea that adds astringency to the finish.
Deep purple fruits, black sage, big cherry and woody spices arise from this wine by Adam Lee, who recently sold to Jackson Family Wines but will remain in charge. The palate shows crushed clove and allspice, licorice, graphite and more dark fruit flavors.
The nose is a bit shy but eventually offers a whiff of black currant while the round, soft palate offers dried black cherry, blackberry and a hint of Mediterranean herb. It's simple but well made. Drink soon.

Gritty tannins frame this Cabernet, with classic blackberry, black currant, cassis and cedar flavors. It's rich, full-bodied and appealingly dry, although it's missing just a bit of the complexity you want in a top-tier Napa Cab of this price.
This is a soft and easy wine from a ripe vintage. With black currant fruit, plenty of acidity and a light touch of tannin, it's made to be drunk young.
The small enclave of Buzet makes wines in a Bordeaux style, with black currant fruitiness and some firm tannins. This wine, now aging well, shows ripe juicy fruits, a solid dry core and refreshing, crisp acidity at the end.
Kind of bizarre, because there are baked custard and sweetened espresso and honeyed spice aromas, and then it turns unnaturally sweet on the palate. It's also flat, with an odd, medicinal aftertaste. Most Sémillons don't have these particular features. —S.H.
This crisp Riesling starts with elegant, floral aromas, followed by refreshing apple and pear flavors. Balanced by a refreshing acidity, the wine is friendly and versatile. Pair with Indian and Chinese cuisine.
Neutral-oak barrels figured into the making of this full-bodied, richly styled wine, tart and floral in aromas while thick in leathery texture. Lemon, lime and grapefruit frame a larger notion of fresh-cut grass and hay.
The Hermit Crab is a plump, medium-bodied blend of Viognier (72%) and Marsanne (28%). Although it retains some Viognier-like elements of melon fruit and fullness of texture, some of the variety's distinctiveness appears to have been blended away by the Marsanne, leaving a less expressive but still nicely balanced and more versatile white wine.
Almond and a hint of raspberry register on an otherwise neutral nose. This feels round and citrusy, while flavors of orange, nectarine and pithy pink grapefruit end with a slight note of oxidation. Drink immediately.
Rusty in color, with rubbery cherry and raspberry aromas, this is a sticky, candied rosé with a low freshness quotient. Candied, sugary flavors finish sweet and gooey.
Notes of ripe cherry, plum, cola, barbecue smoke and dried rosemary open the bouquet. It offers chocolate and spice in the mouth, with a touch of drying astringency on the finish.
This is a taut, terroir-driven Riesling. It is textured with both minerality and tense, racy fruitiness. With its perfumed background, this is a wine for aging. Screwcap.
With 14 months' new wood aging, this wine is still all wood and toast. The wine does have weight, with the promise of blackberry fruits under the firm tannins. It is finely structured and should mature well.
Lovely mixed berries—black, red and blue—cedar shadings, and vanilla mark the nose of this elegant, finely crafted wine. Similar flavors prevail on the palate, with sophisticated licorice and pencil-lead accents. Balanced and graceful, it finishes dry and even, offering dried fruit and mineral notes. Complex and excellent already, but hold until 2004.
This is a cleaner version of the regular estate Pinot, with bright berry flavors, firm acids, and a certain stiffness to the still-youthful tannins. Fine for medium-term cellaring, or give it a good couple of hours in the decanter.
Straightforward, uncomplicated but varietally correct, this wine features the bright blueberry and plum notes of Syrah, accented by hints of dried spices and vanilla. Ample in weight, supple in the mouth, but needs a bit more complexity and length to score higher.
Comprised of 100% estate-grown grapes and barrel fermented in new French oak, this is Woodward Canyon's premier Chardonnay. The richness of the oak almost overpowers the nose, but when one thinks of premier cru Burgundy it's hard to tell the difference. In the mouth, the fruit more than holds its own, with firm acids and plenty of ripe peach and apricot flavors. Additional time in bottle is needed to soften the hard edges. Just 143 cases made.
Reduced and limited up front, with grassy, sweet aromas of sweet plum and berry. The palate is big but muddled by soft, full-bodied flavors of beets, licorice and sweet fruits. Shows some green on the finish.
Black cherry, pepper and smoked meat on the nose are followed by flavors of smoked cherry, vanilla and pepper on the palate. Focused, with a spin of minerality on the finish, this is a versatile food wine.
The inaugural release from this winery, this wine was barrel fermented and aged sur lie for 17 months. Unfiltered and lightly cloudy, it offers appealing aromas of peach, butter and spice that lead to textured but deft flavors and a persistent finish.

Murky, earthy aromas mark the nose—a blend of tomato, herb and meat notes. It feels good, with herbal-berry flavors and grapy thickness. It finishes with a flash of acidity, a note of coconutty oak and a final herbal blast.
As with the winery's Blue Chip bottling, this seems to be approaching an early maturity. Slightly grainy flavors of brown sugar and maple syrup wrap around light cherry candy. The finish is threaded with coffee and butterscotch. This is a wine to enjoy sooner rather than later.
Berry and black plum aromas build the nose. It's bold but a little acidic, with medium intensity and weight supporting snappy flavors of wild blackberry and slightly tart plum. The finish is quick and juicy.
A bouquet of cherry, blueberry and vanilla prepares the tastebuds for flavors of blueberry, strawberry, fennel bulb and white chocolate. There is a nice play on the palate between bright acidity and chewy tannins, and the delightful finish is like a mouthful of blueberry pie with a sprinkling of pomegranate seeds.
Ripe and creamy, this is full of rich pear and green plum fruit. It has weight and is layered with acidity, with a spice note and a taut, mineral texture. This is complex and age worthy.
Lemon-jelly aromas give this a strange character. The fruit reflects the same artificial flavor. It is hard to see where it is going.
Grenache makes up half of this wine with the rest equally split across Syrah and Mourvèdre. It brings aromas of herb, cherry, blueberry and raspberry that are followed by silky feeling red and blue-fruit flavors that linger on the finish.
A special cuvée from the Avensan estate of Château Meyre, this is a modern style of wine, with big, extracted flavors, and ripe tannins. Powerful, intense, packed with dark fruit, it is almost like a Napa Cabernet in its richness.

A great vintage for the Sundance Red, this is 43% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot, 18% Cabernet Franc and 14% Syrah. The addition of Syrah really livens up the mix. It's a supple, sappy, sinuous red, with rich and complex cherry and berry fruits. The 30% new oak is not only lavish for a $20 wine, but it judiciously complements all of the good fruit.
Here is a broadly appealing, instantly approachable white wine with mouthwatering flavors of melon, white peach, pineapple and still more exotic tropical fruits. The wine is round and full, forward and just a little tart, but nicely supported with sweet, spicy barrel flavors.
A very textured wine, with layers of taut fruit skins giving a precise structure. The wine has the brightest acidity, but also has some weight. It needs a few months to develop and deepen in character.
For everyday consumption, this is good Cabernet with rousing fruit, body and pulse. The nose has smoke, rubber, pepper and cured meat to go with berry and cassis aromas, and the palate is very fruity, driving and loaded with flavorful cherry, raspberry and plum fruit. Not refined but good and honest.
Electric acidity and pure, pristine fruit collide in this full-bodied Riesling. Dry in style, it offers layers of crisp green melon, apple and lime flavors, with a textural density that's profoundly majestic. While beautiful already, its mineral richness should only intensify over the next decade.
Heady exotic fruit, tomato vine and chopped herb aromas jump out of the glass. On the generous, savory palate, tangy acidity balances white peach, honeydew melon and juicy grapefruit flavors.
The wine abounds with intensity, richness and power as well as mouthwatering freshness. It is very ageworthy and certainly the most impressive wine from Henri Bourgeois, a tour de force of Sauvignon Blanc.
This bright and polished Barbera d'Alba would make a perfect companion to tortellini with grated Parmigiano cheese and melted butter. The wine boast bright berry and cherry flavors backed by fresh acidity.
A simple wine, with some charm. The chief fault is unripeness, in the form of bell peppers and ammonia. Yet you'll also find citrus and tropical fruits, leading to a honeyed finish.
Voluptuous in wild strawberry, cranberry and tart cherry, Quintus is light and suggestively chalky, balanced in velvety tannins and a backbone of structure. Dancing in the background is a taste of black tea and dark, fragrant earth.
Peach and pear notes vie with almond skin scents in the bouquet of this mainstream Pinot Grigio. It's medium-bodied and plump in the mouth, with pear and citrus flavors that yield a fresh, clean finish.
Spicy, fresh and clean, this would pair with fried seafood or spaghetti con vongole. It offers pretty citrus tones followed by a drying mineral nuance.
This fruity wine, with its blackberry fruit, is ripe, generous and developing fast. A fine juicy character bursts through its firm structure to give a crisp aftertaste. Drink from 2018.
This is pleasant but on the light side, with hints of tomato and herb accenting cherry fruit. Slightly smoky notes add nuance to the aromas, but accentuate some coarseness on the finish.
Hard to believe this came out of a vineyard as esteemed as Truchard's. The wine is candied, soft and simple, with raspberry, cherry and cola flavors. Maybe it was made from young vines.
This is a brawny, strongly powerful wine, fully displaying the grip of mountain fruit. Blackberry and black currant complement the tobacco and cedar. Drink now through 2023.

A simple but nice style of Ribera wine with open plum and berry aromas as well as snappy, juicy, fresh red fruit flavors. It's a touch biting and zesty at this point, but if you don't mind a little bite and zap it's perfectly good.
With its bouquet of black plum, leather and dried herb notes, this lean Zin has good berry fruit. However, its attributes are balanced by a note of volatile acidity on the nose, and it shows some definite heat in the mouth. The narrow, rather angular structure of the wine seems to constrain the blackberry and spice flavors here. Closes with full, fairly even tannins.
Light pink with a tint of yellow, this bottling combines grapes from Sonoma County, Monterey County and Santa Barbara County to deliver nectarine, bubblegum and wet slate aromas. There is chalky tension to the palate, with plum flesh and white peach flavors, as well as persistent river rock minerality.
Dark in color, with aromas of road tar, blackberry and burnt toast. The palate has good life and snap to it, with flavors of black cherry, plum, chocolaty oak and a dash of cough medicine. Solid and scouring on the finish, with vanilla to soften things up. Regular but good value.
Penfolds' Bin 51 is a perennial winner, although the price has been steadily creeping northward. The 2014 is dry and medium-bodied, but fragrant—think flower-shop greens, gingery spice and citrus—and with a welcome bit of texture on the long finish. It should drink well for 10–15 years.
The great Clos des Chênes has produced a finely structured wine. It offers both beautiful red fruits that spread luxuriously in the mouth, and a dark, solid core of dry tannins that promise aging. The balance is impeccable, just the right amount of fresh, juicy acidity adding its lift to the mix.
A peachy, fruit-forward, mouthfilling wine that brings bright Washington fruit—peaches, apples and pears—into play, along with caramel candy and underlying acid support. It falls short only in the finish, which turns slightly bitter and attenuated.
This has been a remarkably consistent bottling from Benovia over the last several vintages. The wine is bone dry and zesty in acidity, with rich layers of raspberries, cranberries and persimmons. Tannic notes of dried tea leaf and exotic baking spices bring extra complexities to this ageworthy wine. Drink 2015–2020.
This generous smooth wine is packed with ripe tannins and vibrant red fruits. There is the typical mineral texture of many Dão wines along with solid spice and dark chocolate flavors from wood aging. This is an impressive wine that deserves to age further, so drink from 2019.
Quite a good Merlot that's made in the Kenwood style, which is drily elegant rather than opulent. Shows class and finesse in the tobacco-edged flavors of cherries and blackberries, subtlely tinged with oak. Ready now.
Fresh and crisp, but it lacks a bit of intensity. An initial blast of sulfur fades readily enough, revealing simple apple and citrus flavors, but that's as far as this usually stellar bottling goes this year. Imported by Loosen Bros. USA.
Light red cherry, marjoram and allspice aromas mark this bottling from a winery in the Central Valley that has sourced fruit from coastal regions for many years. The flavors are even more interesting, as cherry is enhanced by bay leaf, thyme, peppercorns and Indian spices.
Ken Wright produces as many as a dozen or more single-vineyard Pinots in any given vintage. This wine is blended from many of those same sites, whose vines were often planted back in the 1980s. It's light and elegant, yet powerfully flavorful, with strawberry, raspberry and cherry fruit pushing deep into the palate. It's clean and fresh, with crisp defining acidity, perfect balance, refined tannins and a long finish. Best of all, it's widely available.
Sparkling Sauvignon Blanc—what more need be said? Since the bubbles aren't derived from a second fermentation, the wine tastes like a Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc with bubbles. Pineapple and passion fruit notes finish clean but short.
Along with a fascinating nose, this bottling from the appellation's westernmost vineyard offers the rounded ripeness of cherimoya, nectarine and white peach but with a laser-sharp line of crushed sea shell and flint minerality alongside scratched lemon skin. The palate rides that chalky line the whole way, offering hints of lime pith, tangerine, sea salt and just enough almond warmth.
This 2013 keeps up the full body and ripe fruit of previous releases, with lush texture and saturated chocolate and blackberry flavors. It's a dry red, however, with no detectable sweetness but plenty of tannin and satisfaction.
This light and bright white wine from southern Italy offers clean mineral notes of crushed stone and slate backed by peach, honey and citrus. Pair this wine with mussels steamed in white wine sauce and garlic.
Lush fruits of boysenberry, plump raspberry and strawberry mesh with vanilla, nutmeg and allspice on the nose of this bottling from a vineyard off Drum Canyon Road. Black cherry and more vanilla make for a rich palate, but it's cut by an edge of acidity, darker elderberry, savory shiitake and a bay-leaf character that rises on the finish.
A very dry, tannic wine, full of dense structure. The fruit can be found underneath all this dryness, a layer of hedgerow blackberries, tight and firm. At the end, there is some baked acidity.
The perfumes of wood mingle with sweet Malbec berry fruit aromas. The wine is in a style that initially emphasizes the fresh, juicy fruit. Then it moves in on the tannins to give a densely dry wine, finishing with a tight, mineral edge.
Simple aromas of generic red fruits and watermelon settle on a pithy, rather heavy palate. Pyrazine-rich flavors of bitter citrus finish with notes of pink grapefruit and tangerine.
Leafy, herbal aromas of eucalyptus, olive and juniper are big players on the nose of this firmly balanced Cabernet Franc. Spicy, herbal berry flavors are fully oaked and chocolaty. On the finish, this is blackened and tannic, with fleshy black-fruit leftovers and a dusting of oaky cocoa. Drink through 2023.
About 40% is  barrel aged and put through malolactic. This is a heavier, more substantial effort than their regular Chardonnay, with more butterscotch flavors showing. With good fruit, some weight and texture, it's well made and a good value.
A firmly dry wine, driven by the dark tannins, only opening slowly to give ripe berry fruits. The soft side of the wine does bring out the lighter nature of the Baga in the blend, which has been tamed by wood aging. There is a final flourish of fresh black plum juice.
This wine offers a delightful bouquet of blackberry and rose petal with touches of salinity. It is smooth and silky at first sip, with flavors of black plum, cherry, chocolate, lavender, and freshly roasted coffee. As it makes its way around the mouth, stern tannins make their presence known and then recede into a finish notable for a lingering espresso bean flavor.
Salty brioche and pretzel bread come to mind first on the entry of this wine, both aromatically and on the palate. An intensity of ripe peach and pineapple show through with lush, full-bodied force, accented in vanilla oak.
Chunky cassis, tobacco and cedar mark the nose and palate of this textbook Cabernet. It's round in the mouth, with a long, richly textured finish that adds nuances of cocoa and dried herb. Like its close cousin from the Hickinbotham Vineyard, it can be drunk now–2025.
On first take, this smells a bit green and grassy, while the feel is grabby. Airing and time in the glass help things along, while the flavor profile is a bit salty and oaky, with plum and red-currant notes. A dry earthy peppery-tasting finish closes this out.
This wine's neutral nose hints slightly at green pear and lemon. The palate is wonderfully brisk, with lemon and pear fruit that's exquisitely light and refreshing. A versatile white with a clean finish.
A powerful, rich and creamy wine that has a soft texture, hinting at wood aging and attractive spice and yellow fruits. It fills the mouth easily with ripe fruits, toast and rich acidity.
There's a lot of appeal with notes of apricot, mango, butter and toasty spices. It's creamy in feel with the oak—70% American, half new—speckling the fruit flavors and the finish.
The winery is perhaps best known for its Merlots, here done in an overtly oaky style. Chewy, woody and quite astringent, the tannins lead, with dried berry and dark chocolate also in the mix. Fine for everyday drinking with your favorite cut of beef.

This beautiful Pinot Noir shows classic cool-climate characteristics of dryness and acidity, with a silky texture. The flavors are deeply delicious, suggesting raspberries and cola, pomegranates and rhubarbs, cranberries and white pepper spice. The price is fair considering the pedigree. Drink now.
This is the kind of PG that makes the variety such a perfect all-purpose white. It's bone dry, with a great crunch of acidity that brightens slightly herbal grapefruit zest, white peach, Meyer lemon and wildflower flavors. Interestingly, the wine did not undergo malolactic, and while it was fermented in stainless steel, it was sur lies aged.
You might think this was a North Coast Merlot, it's so ripe and round and pleasant to drink. Not complex, but with pretty black-cherry flavors and their hint of smoky oak, it's tasty. Plus, the tannins are soft. Loses a bit for some raisiny notes, but otherwise, not bad. Best Buy.
A ripe, modern success with everything a fan of New World reds might want. The nose is floral and beautiful, with fine oak scents supporting brilliant raspberry, plum and spice aromas. It's deep, smooth and pressing in the mouth, with a delicious set of blackberry, coconut, vanilla and creamy flavors. A beauty to drink now through 2017.
Full-bodied, ripe and round, this tangy Merlot is swathed in liquorous barrel flavors. It needs decanting to smooth out the alcoholic burn, and let the fruit emerge from the lumber yard. But it's fine tasting, with a rich chocolaty finish, designed to please those who enjoy a California style red.
Butterscotch and roasted corn-on-the-cob aromas are followed by an off-dry, viscous, creamy feeling palate. Vanilla notes persist on the finish.

Packaged in an attractive sunflower-adorned screwcap bottle, this Chardonnay made from organic grapes is light, bright and straightforward—tasting of lemon, lime and kiwi—with barely any oak influence.
Tightly constructed for an entry-priced Chardonnay, this has faint almond nuttiness accenting pineapple and grapefruit flavors. Drink this medium-bodied wine through mid-2018.
The aromas of sarsparilla, tree bark, dried raspberry and cumin take you back to traditional Rioja winemaking. With lighter-weight fruit, herb and tomato leaf flavors, this is a solid old-school wine that will hit the right marks with tapas or roast meats. It's got some tea and tang as well, courtesy of zesty acids.
Both of these outstanding vineyards contributed equally to this older (25+ years) vines Cabernet. It's sleek and sappy, and it serves up a full spectrum of berries as only Washington Cab can. Young, primary fruit flavors carry a lot of snap at the moment, and the bright acids suggest that a few more years in bottle will continue to improve this impressive effort.
Combines power with delicacy to produce a savory, complex young Pinot Noir. Shows a silky texture and crisp coastal acidity, with potent flavors of ripe red cherries, Dr. Pepper cola, beef jerky and black pepper. Delicious and dry. Best now–2012.
Gaseous and minerally on first blush, it has funky, earthy aromas of leaves and olive that could use a hit of freshness. It feels grabby and scratchy, with an olive flavor and a hot finish that has a latex-like character. This is a big wine that misses some elegance.
While it shows modest cherry pie filling flavors, it's simple and sweet, with a harshness from acidity and tannins.

Beeswax, mature orchard fruit and yellow flower aromas emerge from the glass. The refreshing palate offers lemon drop, peach and pear alongside tangy acidity. A grapefruit note closes the finish.
87–89. Barrel sample. This wine is solid and dark with bitter tannins that offer a hard edge to the riper blackberry fruits. A dense wine that has a very dry core.
Aromas of rose hips, tomato leaf, raisin and black cherry get this fuller-bodied Pinot going on its way to a chunky palate of ripe raspberry, plum and creamy oak. There's length and a smooth mouthfeel, and it avoids common New World pot holes like faux butter or popcorn-like flavors. Drink now.
This oak-aged Verdejo is yellow in color, with aromas of mustard and apple cider. In the mouth, this is weighty and a bit candied despite offering acidic cut. Outright sweet flavors of peach and melon finish mustardy like the nose, with oaky, resiny notes.
The vineyard straddles Atlas Peak and the Pritchard Hill region, and this beautiful Cabernet shows its terroir in the firm tannins and ripe, complex flavors. It's high in alcohol, which gives it some heat, and it is rich in flavors of blackberry and cherry jam and cassis liqueur. Give it an hour or two in the decanter and drink now.
Whiffs of smoke accent musky floral notes on this delicately fragrant dry wine. Medium-bodied in style, it's brisk and brash on the palate with tart white grapefruit and lemon flavors anchored against a deep, stony minerality.
Distinctly mineral in character, this is a tough wine with its tense tannins and firm, very dry fruitiness. Black currant and berry fruits shine through this structure giving a full, juicy character. It's a wine of power and richness, still restrained by its tight, dry texture. Drink from 2018.
This is light—the Ten in the name refers to its alcohol level—dry, crisp and fragrantly fresh. It is citrus dominant and deliciously refreshing—a wine that livens up the palate.
Well structured, it places its raspberry fruit in a compact, focused core. An appealing and balanced mix of herb, baking spices, citrus and white pepper highlights give the wine complexity beyond its apparent lightness. Drink now–2019.
This is one of the best California Chardonnays in its price range. It's not a rich wine; instead, it's dry, crisply acidic and minerally, with citrus zest, vanilla cream and subtle oak flavors. With 65,000 cases produced, this should be easy to find.
Very light in color, this bottling offers tight, bright and plump aromas of peach and lime pith. Lime candy and citrus pop on the palate, giving life to ripe Asian pear flavors that ride a grippy texture all the way into the finish.
There's an intriguing herbaceous character of juniper and chaparral scrub on this appellation-blend bottling, along with red currant fruit and iron minerality. The palate shows complex flavors of pine sap and eucalyptus oil, orange rinds and rosemary against a backdrop of blackberry fruit.
Peach and pear flavors give a rich feel to this warm wine. It has vanilla and cream flavors, with a citrus character that cuts through the ripeness on the finish. Ready to drink.
Ripe and round Gala apple, peach custard and vanilla cream aromas show on the nose of this appellation blend from Tolosa's new winemaking team. It's light and easy on the palate, with steely tension framing its lemon and lime flavors, a creamy vanilla component adding weight to the midpalate.
Raspberry ripeness and soft tannins lend warmth to this structured wine. It has weight and a smoky wood character, with a juicy finish. Age for 2–3 years.
The 2004 vintage wasn't an easy one for Nelson Pinot Noir, and this wine reflects that. The aromas are slightly earthy and herbal, marked by tomato and beet elements, while the flavors are herbal to the point of mintiness but also fresh and appealing. Ultimately, it's an attractive effort destined for short-term drinking.
This is a full-bodied but also subtle and complex-flavored wine. The aromas bring in mild wood smoke and black-pepper notes, then the flavors add ample fruitiness without going to jamminess. The overall effect is one of sophistication.
Minty sage and cedar dot the aromatic profile of this wine that is holding on to tannin and oak with a fierce stubbornness. Tart cherry, pomegranate and blueberry give it a fruity mélange, accented by subtle rose petal and violet.
All varietal, this wine is a blend of Scooteney Flats, Kiona and Canyons vineyards. Aromas of exotic spices, clove and purple fruit lead to elegant supple flavors that linger. It still needs time to fully blossom.
This opens with staunch green aromas that shout out bell pepper and herbaceous. But give it air and this Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend comes around to show spicy baked-berry flavors on a tannic, full-bodied frame. On the finish, it's herbal, stout and round, with leafy flavors to go with dark-fruit notes. Drink through 2018.
Very good for its complexity, although it's tough and tannic, and the acidity sticks out. The blackberry, currant and cherry flavors are rich and nuanced, but the wine feels hard and sharp. Odds are the lifespan is six years: cellar or decant.
Floral and mineral tones emerge from the nose of this white wine from Sicily. Executed in an easy and fresh style, this crisp—and slightly sweet—wine would pair with tuna salad and fried calamari.
In almost any other producer's lineup, this would be deemed a success, but in the context of Rippon's exalted reputation, this is a bit of a disappointment. Ripe pear, melon and citrus flavors are off dry and marked by floral notes, finishing clean and mouthwatering, but don't have much of the expected complexity.
A foundation of thick tannin and oak give size and weight to this full-bodied wine that offers waves of smoky leather, cedar, tar and black cherry on the nose and palate. More savory than fruity, it is a compelling expression of this relatively cooler appellation in the Napa Valley. Drink now through 2020.
Sharp and tannic, with cherry, blackberry, coffee, cocoa and peppery flavors. Exuberantly rustic now, but could mellow with a year or two in the bottle.
Sweet and corny on the nose, and then soft and sweet in the mouth, with candy corn and cereal flavors. Finishes candied, sort of like a glass of corn flakes topped with a sparkle.
90–92. Barrel sample. Spicy new wood and the characteristically firm tannins of Saint-Estèphe yield a solid, chunky, powerful wine. With so much black plum, ginger and all-spice character, it's already quite complex and will develop well.
This Paulliac-style blend of mostly Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot presents bright red fruit on the nose alongside black licorice and traditional cigar box scents. The flavors are dominated by red cherries with a touch of anise, sprig of thyme and pleasingly brisk finish.
Ripe, rich and fruity, this is Gamay from old vines that give extra concentration. The wine is full of bitter cherries, tight acidity and a light texture. Drink now.
A little light in body, but a solid Pinot Noir, at a good price. Shows real Russian River character, with cherry, pomegranate, persimmon and spicy Dr. Pepper flavors. Drink now.
Wölffer Merlots are similar in style: high acidity and mild tannins on a light- to medium-bodied frame. This vintage has aromas of red berry, earth, spice and dill, while the palate is similar, but with a burnt character and dill playing a leading role.
The alcohol would indicate a level of ripeness which does not register in terms of flavor or density. Thin generic red fruit has a slightly burnt edge to it, and it fades out quickly.
Another good and affordable white from Hungary. Pretty floral and flirty aromas and a bright, tropical fruit flavor profile make this wine accessible and good for stand-alone sipping or pairing with spicy cuisine. Imported by MHW Ltd.
Not exactly a world-class white wine but at least it smells and tastes like Chardonnay. The nose offers some butter and lemon curd, while the palate is jumpy and tastes like a mix of pear, apple and spice. A fresh, young wine that should be drunk soon.
Don't be too quick to dismiss this wine as thin. It's the polar opposite of those ubiquitously jammy, chocolaty wines. Instead, it's moderately low in alcohol and rather severe, with notable acidity, and the fruit is subtle, compounded with green herbs and tobacco. The dryness and complexity make it worth repeated interest.
This is a pronounced wine, boasting upfront aromas of blackberry, plum and boysenberry that are graced with additional scents of licorice, chicory, black pepper and crushed violet. The palate is bold, with a gripping texture that supports the lush black-fruit flavors. Toasted oak and sweet smoke accents grace the medium-length finish. Drink now–2020.
A little heavy and ripe for a Pinot Noir, this bottling shows pie-filling flavors of cherries, blackberries and currants, with a candied chocolate-covered mint sweetness. It also seems overly soft. Drink now.
A Merlot-Cabernet blend from the Hyde Vineyard in Carneros, this wine is pretty green for such a ripe vintage as '04. There's a dry tannin, green bean edge to the fruit, and improvement with age doesn't seem likely.
Aromas of forest floor, red currant, cedar, game and blue flower lead the nose. The structured palate offer a core of juicy black cherry while notes of vanilla, espresso, licorice and grilled herb add depth. Fine-grained tannins provide the framework.
This plump, medium-bodied Chardonnay boasts aromas and flavors of smoke and grilled pineapple. It may be a little on the simple side, but it's well done, combining ample varietal character with an appetizing bit of oak.
This Prosecco Extra Dry has full notes of almond and stone fruit backed by sticky honey and mature fruit. The wine tastes sweet and fruity and has pretty floral nuances with some mildly sour flavors on the finish.
Sharp acidity and intense oak meet in this deeply concentrated, tropically-influenced white. Peach, apple pie, and faint pineapple flavors all figure in.
This is a delicate Pinot Gris, medium-sweet in style, taking its cue from the baked apple flavor and fragrant acidity. A touch of spice gives a counterpoint to the refreshing aftertaste.
Fruit is sourced from beautiful vineyards nestled between the folds of the hills in Radda in Chianti. Thanks to aromas of ripe fruit, spice and dark leather, you can imagine a successful pairing with stewed meats. There's a raw, bright touch on the close followed by a drying sense of minerality.
Blackberry and plum fruit is taut, accented by some exotic spice, and feels more dense on the front palate than on the toasty-oak finish. Still, it's a pleasing, easy-to-drink wine that's a safe bet for parties—particularly barbecues, as this seems just the ticket for a burger, or grilled meat.
A strange wine that doesn't knit together. The high alcohol, super ripe fruit and nutty, oxidized flavors suggest that it will have a brief lifespan. Flavors of preserves, raisins, prunes and carmelized sugars.
This wine has a nose of black fruits, mocha and toffee, and on the palate, warming spices, tart cherry and a touch of sweetness. The flavors aren't overly complex, but the wine is appealing, and the finish lingering.
Very dry and tannic, as Petite Sirah should be. But unlike many “Pets,” it's also balanced and elegant. The official alcohol is only 13.5%, yet there's not a trace of greenness. In fact, the wine, which has plenty of French oak, is quite rich in blackberry and black currant flavors. Really a superb example, a Petite Sirah for Cabernet fans. Should evolve interestingly for many years.
Soft, rather sweet and appealing. What it lacks in stuffing and complexity, it makes up for in sheer deliciousness. Opulent in raspberries, cherries, red currants, red licorice, Dr. Pepper, bacon, pepper and sandalwood. Drink now–2013.
Sweet and simple, with pleasantly exotic flavors of pineapples, green apples, pears, honeysuckle flowers, minerals, spices, vanilla, brown sugar and smoky oak. Easy to drink.
Elegant and straightforward, this Spanna opens with damp earth and some lifted flowery notes. Mouthcoating tannins frame cherry and rose petal flavors which persist on the medium finish. Drink now to 2011.
With a high proportion of Pinot Noir in the blend, this ripe wine has a sense of structure as well as fruitiness. Rich pear and apricot flavors are balanced by the fresh, crisp aftertaste. The wine is rounded and ready to drink.
A clean and correct Morellino that doesn't boast huge intensity but does deliver satisfying and seducing aromas of cherry, spice and toasted nut. The wine has a firm structure, velvety mouthfeel and good length on the finish.
Crisp and fruity, with lemon, lime, pineapple and spice flavors, brightened with mouth-cleansing acidity. Yet it's a bit too strong in those feline pyrazines that lend a green, unripe taste.
A thrilling wine, this impresses instantly with its detail and definition. Vividly fruity with a mix of melon, apple and stone fruits, this tangy, toasty effort has nuanced notes of herb and mineral as well. Drink now through 2030.
The Il Falchetto offers lovely aromas of fresh peach, honeysuckle and lime peel. The palate is more delicate but the wine is beautifully balanced, and initially, there is more than enough intensity of flavor. But as it moves towards the finish, it begins to run out of steam.
The nose is all gardenia and pear enveloped by citrus. The crisp palate doesn't have a great deal of intensity but compensates with very pleasant flavors of pear drop and nettle. Enjoy with fish in a citrus sauce.
Relatively restrained for Viognier, with attractive fruit notes of muskmelon, apricot and pineapple, but not much more in the way of complexity. It's medium bodied, with a long, refreshing finish that hints at white pepper. Drink now.
Floral berry and plum aromas are lightly woody. This feels full and edgy, with fairly hard tannins. Black-fruit flavors are certainly ripe, while this finishes bold and intense, with scratchy tannins. The blend is Monastrell, Tempranillo and Cab Sauvignon.
A Cabernet of strong olive, oak and cassis aromas, medium in weight with smoky overtones that tastes a bit hotter than it is.
This rich, hearty and ultimately lovely blend of 82% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Cabernet Franc and 8% Petit Verdot still needs time to open up. When it does, expect dense and pure aromas of blueberry, black currant, graphite and nose-tickling spice. The palate's intense structure, though shy for now, reveals charred beef, coffee, caramel, black cherry and dried rose flavors. Drink 2019–2030.
This is a delicious wine full of ripe fruit tones. It is richly textured while keeping plenty of freshness from the Antão Vaz that dominates the blend. It has a firm mineral background that gives structure. The finish brings a zippy orange zest note.
A dry core pervades this full-bodied wine. Red fruits are masking its delicious ripe meat and sweet jam flavors. There is a distinct tannic element that holds this attractive wine together.
From the Heideboden Vineyard, this rich and fruity effort combines an intense black-plum flavor with solid tannins. It has a dark character that shows the severe side of Zweigelt. Age for 2–3 years. Glass stopper.
Sabathi's entry-level Sauvignon Blanc is a fresh, grapefruity rendition, with hints of gooseberry and a touch of smoky, fumé-style character. Lacks a bit of richness in the midpalate, but finishes with good verve.
Nearly black, this big wine smells like dark berries dipped in vanilla cream, with a hint of barnyard. The barnyard carries to the palate, where it's joined by leather and blackberry. Tannins start off smooth, but develop plenty of grip with time. Warm throughout, this is one that should be decanted a few hours before serving.
You'll find distinct flavors of softened Dr. Pepper cola and black currants in this robust Cabernet. It has the brambly, peppery personality of Zinfandel, but with Cab's more elegant structure. Drink up.
A zesty blend of Grenache Blanc, Roussanne, Marsanne and Viognier, this shows melon, tuberose, white lily and sharp lemon zest on the nose. The palate treads between energy and warmth, offering citrusy acidity against buttered, toasted nuts, all framed by a pithy grip that keeps the texture center stage.
This wine is a blend of 51% Cabernet Sauvignon, 37% Merlot and 12% Cabernet Franc. Aromas of plum, dried herb, cocoa and barrel spice are followed by reserved fruit and savory flavors. It shows a sense of poise and polish.
Named for the soil layers important to wine's terroir, this Pinot is sourced from a variety of sites and multiple clones, providing a complexity of wild strawberry, high acidity and an herbaceous, oaky backdrop. A teasing kiss of toffee and chocolate on the finish is deliciously intriguing.
Austere and steely at first, this white settles into crisp, tangy grapefruit and lemon notes, centered around a bright, medium body. The mouthfeel is crisp and clean, uncomplicated, yet well-crafted and composed.
Situated on the ridge in the center of Entre-deux-Mers that produces fine white wines, this vineyard has produced a wine that is rich and full. Apricot and ripe pear fruits have a perfumed touch along with almond and spice flavors. It could do with a few more months and will be best from 2017.
This is yet another stunning wine from this site, guided by the capable hands of Winemaker and Viticulturalist Bibiana González Rave, who has coaxed from it beguiling layers of complex concentration and sublime notions of tang and salt. The only white from a sea of Pinot Noir grown here, it speaks to what the extreme Sonoma Coast can bring to the variety—a celebration of lemon zest, crisp apple and brioche delicately wrapped in minerality.
Limited production, tight and interesting. This 100% Petite Sirah is one of just a handful of varietal versions of the grape made in Washington. It features ripe berry flavors—blueberry in particular—wrapped in well-managed tannins with hints of caramel running through the finish. Still young, primary fruit, with a sharp edge to the tannins. Give it a couple more years in the cellar for optimal drinking.
With spicy aromas of kirsch and dark plum accented by cedar and tobacco, this blend of Carmenère, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Merlot is a whopper. In the mouth, it's thick and syrupy, with chewy tannins and bold flavors of baked berry and chocolate. On the finish, brown sugar and coconut enter the frame. This is ultraripe and aggressive, but it honestly exemplifies Chile at the high end. Drink now–2017; 250 cases made.
This is one compact package of citrus flavors: the nose is shy but the palate is a slender, taut but expressive parcel of zesty lemon and lime notes. This is dry, utterly refreshing and clean. It's a light-bodied wine designed to enliven and invigorate. The finish is dry and zesty.
Beautifully pure and creamy notes of golden apple dominate the nose. The palate has a similarly gentle apple note that harmonizes perfectly with the light, dry body and the fine bubbles. This elegant pink sparkler will give lots of pleasure before and during a meal.
This blend of 91% Syrah and 9% Grenache delivers a load of wild herbs and forest undergrowth to the savory nose, giving depth to the cassis and vanilla aromas. That garrigue character is wrapped around the mulberry and boysenberry core of the palate, where touches of smoke and roasted pork complete the sip.
Dense and dark, with a color akin to purple ink. Catchy, well-made, the fruit is ripe and abnormally friendly, while the structure is solid. What makes this an above-average wine in its class is that the acidity is mellow, not shrill as is often the case.
A bit sharp on the nose, implying the high acid that is later evident in the mouth. Aromas of green bean, onion and cranberry lead to cran-/strawberry flavors with hints of oak and earth. Light-to-medium bodied and on the tart side.
Made from 100% Chardonnay, this bubbly shows Schramsberg's ease of producing rich, clean and elegant sparkling wines. It's delicious now in vanilla, yeast, lime and Asian pear flavors, with some sweetness from the dosage, but try giving it 5–6 years in the cellar.
Ripe and succulent, this opens with aromas of mature black fruit, leather, graphite and Mediterranean herb. The full-bodied palate delivers juicy black cherry, mocha and baking spice alongside chewy, mature tannins. Drink through 2019.
Ripe in fruity flavor, a bit sharp and rustic, this wine brims with blackberry jam, cola, chocolate and coffee. The best part is the tannin structure, which is smooth and rich.
Very dark, structured wine, with coffee as well as fruit flavors. The wood comes through firmly producing a solid, very dry character. The more juicy black currant fruits are still to show well. So wait to drink until 2015.
Not bad but fading. This Trebbiano-Chardonnay blend features apple aromas and flavors, and then some quince and orange around the edges. Soft, with some banana on the finish. Drink right away because it won't last much longer.
This structured wine is full of fruit and has a tight texture. It shows a creamy side from new wood, although this is well integrated into the fruity acidity and the mineral edge. The wine is likely to age well, ready to drink from 2020.
A solid, good Cabernet, with very ripe, extracted blackberry, blueberry and chocolate flavors, wrapped into firm tannins. It's a little forward and obvious now, and will take a few years of cellaring.
Underbrush, mature plum, leather and Asian spice aromas lead the nose. On the palate, nectarine zest, espresso, graphite and allspice add depth to the core of dried black cherry, while firm, fine-grained tannins provide support. It finishes on a licorice note.
An impressive, serious wine that's only produced in top vintages. It's elegant and complex, a powerful wine with its dark tannins, licorice and black plum flavors. Concentrated and intense, it's worth aging for at least four years.
The seemingly late-picked, almost overripe fruit veers from plum and blackberry aromas and flavors into sweet rhubarb and tomato preserves. This Chilean Merlot is flavorful, with light to medium body and a dry finish.
Ripe and creamy, a classic sparkling Vouvray showing well in a cool year. It has weight and richness as well as fresh nuts and spice flavors, with just a touch of pepper. The acidity is well in balance.
This estate-grown wine is exuberantly lemony and floral on the nose while the palate boasts lush, concentrated flavors of honey, oak, vanilla and baked pear. Full bodied, it wears its oak well, allowing it to speak in tandem with the ripe fruit.
Colle Ara opens with a light copper color that reflects the natural hue of the grape skins of Pinot Grigio. The aromas include white almond, grapefruit and peach cobbler and the mouthfeel is fresh but creamy at the same time.
The fruit is at the fore here, with aromas of blue fruit, wet stone and spice, along with a whiff of tire rubber. The palate has sweet fruit flavors with nubby tannins and a tart coffee-filled finish.
This tastes a little sweet, in the Rosenblum style, with apricot, orange and pear flavors. But it's nicely crisp in acidity, which gives it a clean finish. Delightful now as a cocktail sipper.
A blend of Roupeiro and Alvarinho (the two varieties in the name of the wine), this is a smooth wine, ripe with bright fruit and acidity. It has a crisp flavor that balances the warm fruitiness. Ready to drink, although it will be better from 2017.
The blend is 55% Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Syrah and 5% Merlot; the fruit is sourced from vineyards scattered throughout eastern Washington. Velvety and supple, this is a modulated mix of bright, sassy blackberry and currant fruit, spiced up with the peppery highlights of Syrah. The effect is to move it solidly into the Australian camp, which makes perfect sense, for nowhere else in the New World do these two grapes sync up so well. Vanilla and espresso streaks enhance the finish.
From a famous vineyard, this is an interesting, even eccentric Zin. The aromas are claret-like, with currant and blackberry and a strong gamy note, like bacon. The fruit is very ripe, even overripe, and the tannins and acidity are ample. Fans of big, old-style Zins will love it.
In this challenging vintage, Colombo's entry-level Cornas is a bit lean and tart, turning crisp and cranberry-like despite having 14% alcohol. Cherry, sandalwood and vanilla flavors are pleasant enough, just without the warmth and flesh of a warmer year.
This is a typically snappy New Zealand Sauvignon featuring mildly vegetal aromas along with the required touch of cat pee and grapefruit. Bold lemon and tangerine flavors comprise the citrus palate, which leads into a tangy acid-driven finish full of lemon and grapefruit. Tart, juicy and pleasant.
Bold fruit and oak-driven notes display broad brush strokes of cherry, clove, cinnamon and vanilla bean. Smooth, rich velvety mouthfeel. This is still young, fruity and vinous; let it age 10 years or more.
Sourced from the Sangiacomo and Gap's Crown vineyards within the Petaluma Gap area of the appellation, this is a tight, tangy wine. Full of citrus, cranberry and dried herb, it finishes savory in sage and forest floor accents. The acidity is subtle and the tannins integrated, making for a well-balanced wine.
This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot has aromas of coffee, black cherry and dark chocolate. It is tart in the mouth, with flavors of cherry and red raspberry.
This isn't a wine to age. It's soft and appealing in its charms, offering drink-me-now cherries, red currants, herbs and sandalwood. The winemaker blended it with a little Cabernet Sauvignon and Petite Verdot, which gives it structural and flavor complexities.
This Syrah-Grenache rosé is intensely herbal, with strong notes of thyme, sage, parsley, laurel and lavender, all grounded by a tart cherry character. The palate is pleasantly zippy in acidity and a touch astringent through the close, with notes of orange pith and melon rind that linger nicely. Drink now.
This is a soft, ripe wine, with juicy acidity to keep it fresh. Flavors of lemon, tangy spice and baked apples are balanced by the taut texture of this still-young wine. Drink from 2017.
This is gritty, burnt and stalky smelling. On the palate it's sour and underdeveloped as a whole.
Made by Long Shadows winemaker Gilles Nicault, this wine, along with the 2008 and 2009 vintages, were released together. This is the most mature—a five-grape, Bordeaux-style blend. It's a beautifully integrated, floral and dusty wine, with contoured, sculpted fruit. Plums and cherries dominate, with dustings of cocoa powder, coffee and a hint of hazelnut. The wine is graceful and profound, with superb length and finesse.
It opens with aromas of underbrush, leather, fennel, prune and plum with just a whiff of rubber. The palate delivers dense black cherry accented with fresh mint, sage, espresso and mocha alongside fine but tightly-knit tannins that need time to unwind.
Delightfully fresh and sweet, this playful sparkler would pair with almost anything from the dessert table. The creamy finish is redolent of peach and honey.
Lightly stalky aromas with red currant and dried red plum feed into a tangy, one-dimensional palate boasting racy, citric flavors of raspberry, herb and tomato. This basic Pinot finishes fresh, minty and herbal.
Light honey and peach aromas intensify briefly on the palate—think grilled peaches. Has a sawdusty veneer of oak; will do for casual circumstances.
Fruity and crisp, this is an attractive lemon and pear-flavored wine from certified organic vineyards. With fresh, balanced acidity and a creamy texture, this 60% Sauvignon and 40% Sémillon blend is ready to drink.
Power marks this gigantic Syrah. What it lacks in subtlety, it makes up for with its sheer size. Syrah doesn't get much riper in blackberry, cherry and chocolate flavors. With its thick, rich tannins, drink it soon with beef and game dishes.
This is a fruity, crisp wine. Red currant and candied red-berry fruits fit into a balanced, just off-dry character. The wine is bright with a light sparkle at the end.
Very intense herbal wine, full-bodied, with hints of mineral and a very forward grapefruit and lime fruit character.
Here is a bright, very textured wine, with a tangy character bringing out fennel as well as red berry flavors. Crisp and tight, this is a great food rosé.
With perfumed black-currant and damson fruitiness, this is a juicy wine. That freshness contrasts with a firm texture, chocolate and smoky flavors and a tannic aftertaste. Drink from 2018.
Half-and-half Négrette and Syrah, this is typical blend for Fronton with its hints of the Mediterranean mixed in with a more Atlantic influence. The wine is soft and balanced with dusty tannins, red fruits and a perfumed aftertaste. Drink now.
Very ripe yellow pears set the scene. Richness continues on the palate, with the wine preserving a light touch without sacrificing concentration. Full marks for balance, charm and savory length.
Very ripe tropical fruits and appealing pear, apple and spice notes show well in this nicely balanced wine. Good acidity plays a solid supporting role here. The toasty oak holds the almost overripe fruit in check—it's strong from the mid palate through the handsome butter-and-apple finish.
A blend of grapes from two excellent Yakima Valley vineyards—Dineen and Red Willow—results in a user-friendly Syrah loaded with pretty spices and scents of fresh cut tobacco and black tea. The leafy aromas wrap around somewhat blocky black cherry and blueberry fruit.
Very tough in tannins now, and bone dry, but it's not showing the richness you want for it to survive time in the cellar. Some modest blackberry flavors, which turn into black currants and cocoa toward the finish, relieve the austerity. But it doesn't seem likely to improve.
Crushed tomato vine, yellow stone fruit and honeydew melon aromas almost jump out of the glass. The ripe medium-bodied palate gives creamy peach and juicy apricot while notes of aromatic herb accent the finish.
Kroara opens with a tired, slightly browning appearance and offers raw berry flavors with sour cherry and cranberry. Zippy freshness helps pick it up in the mouth.
This very floral and herbally tinged bottling shows fresh crushed thyme, black peppercorns, lavender and woody blackberries on the nose. The palate shows some of the same, but descends into a very purple Concord grape flavor.
This is pure Cabernet from one of Washington's oldest vineyards. Cold Creek is a hot site, and its grapes are scattered throughout many of the Ste. Michelle brands, often providing the core fruit. Here is the essence, a wine that opens a bit grudgingly, but has structure and concentration if you take the time to let it blossom. Dense cherry and cassis fruit is tightly wound with balancing acids. The use of new oak is restrained, but sufficient, and this is a wine that should age nicely for many years.
Pretty aromas of cola, rosebuds, dried strawberry, fennel and Dr Pepper show brightly on the nose of this blend of 55% Grenache, 29% Syrah and 16% Mourvèdre.There is a slightly charred flavor to the palate, where grilled black cherries and berries are intriguingly savory and lifted by crushed black pepper.
Underbrush, sunbaked soil, toast, and espresso aromas come together in the glass. The structured, tightly wound palate shows star anise, dried black cherry and a note of powdered sage with bracing tannins that grip the finish.
From a three-acre block of the Valley View Vineyard just east of Solvang, this clonal selection shows cedar, black olive, black pepper and elderberry fruit on the tightly wound nose. Tart but ripe boysenberry fruit shows on the palate, spiced with peppercorn, more cedar and a slate-like minerality. Sticky tannins carry those flavors into the finish.
The very pure scent of freshly cut Conference pear subtly presents itself on the nose. The palate continues in the same, friendly and evocative vein, adding notions of ripe stone fruit, subtle melon hints and a creamy, textured core of exquisite elegance. Cream and fruit vie for attention—but remain slender, citric and toned until the echoing last note.
You can quibble with the price, but there's no doubt about the quality of this Zin. It's extraordinarily deeply flavored, offering waves of wild cherries, cola, anise, molé sauce, pepper spice and sandalwood, wrapped into profoundly fine tannins, and with a long, dry finish. Drink this near-perfect Zinfandel over the next six years.
This is dry and brisk in acidity, with firm tannins and great structural integrity. At the same time, it's vast in blackberry and cherry-jam flavors, while the oak overlay is strong but perfectly matched with the wine's volume. Very fine, complex and elegant, this is a Cabernet to cellar for eight years; it could be one for the long haul.
There's big, stewy fruit happening within the midst of this soft wine. What brings it down is the finish, slightly bitter like a sour cherry.
Shows some nice complexity, marrying earthy undertones with tart berry fruit and peppered meat, but comes across as crisp—verging on lean—before falling away on the finish. A bit European, or at least cooler-climate, in style.
Candied cherry and tangerine are welcome flavors in this crisp, dry and exceptionally light and easy-drinking wine. It's bright and long-lasting in refreshment.
Made entirely with Merlot, this opens with aromas of black cherry and caramel that follow through to the dense palate along with a hint of cedar. Clenching tannins leave a mouth-puckering finish.
A rounded wine, expressing its attractive, somehow creamy texture through apple and grapefruit flavors. It is poised, certainly not heavy, great as an apéritif wine.
The sweet wine appellation of Cérons is just next door to Barsac. This 2005, now mature, shows the possibilities of these wines. It still has the botrytis, but it also has a rich texture that is rounding, losing its initial sweetness and gaining complexity. Drink now, or age until 2020.
A Zin brimming with berry deliciousness, this is lushly fruit forward with a dusty coat and hints of cracked black pepper for good measure. It has a great, long, cocoa-kissed finish.
Only just coming together, this has some richness and an expressive perfumed character. With its fine depth of flavor, a hint of spice and complexity, it's a wine that will age over several years.
Black cherry and cassis aromas mix with some heat, rubber and harshness on the bouquet. With time it settles into better form, showing rich, bold berry and plum flavors, spice and some heat and scour. Roasted and dark on the finish, and rugged overall.
From a vineyard of 100-year-old vines discovered during building works in the city of Almeirim, this beautiful wine is ripe with tropical mango and pineapple fruits and an intense rich character. The concentration is balanced with pear and apple acidity, giving a fine wine that is now ready to drink.
This single-vineyard Zinfandel manages to rein its wild power, taming it down and allowing the wine to feel elegant. That's not so easy, when you have a wine with such high alcohol and superripe fruit. The wild blueberry and blackberry fruit has a brambly edge, but the tannin-acid balance is fine. Drink over the next eight years as the wine subtlely loses fruit and gains earthy complexities.
Light and friendly aromas of green apple, pear, vanilla and slate. Apples and pear flavors are touched up by a slight nuttiness. Finishes a bit heavy, with oak and toast stepping on and over the fruit. Full acidity keeps it tight.
The fruity, jammy forwardness of this Pinot makes you think it will develop in the cellar, but it's a little too soft for extended aging. So give it a good decanting, and enjoy the raspberries, cherries and opulent new oak over the next year or two.
A dark-colored, wood-aged wine, this is serious and power­ful. It has tannic weight along with a black­berry flavor, and a smooth tar and herb layer that's all balanced by the acidity. The wood still needs another year to fully integrate; age for another 2–3 years.
In his continual quest for unusual blends, DFJ winemaker José Neiva has come up with this mix of the Vinho Verde grape Alvarinho and Chardonnay.

As the name suggests, this blend of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon does taste big and bold, but it also tastes hot and lopsided. It has a Port-like consistency, with notes of charred sesame seed, chocolate and dark cherry that lack precision.
A lovely wine that sings crisp Chardonnay, with the added complexity of a taut mineral character and richness from its ripe pear and melon flavors. It will age, its tight acidity needing 2–3 years to soften out.

Taut plum fruit on the palate, with tannins that are hefty but still approachable. Offers pretty spice, carob and cassis aromas.
Very light on the nose, this wine from an extreme coastal site shows key limes, wet slate and pear flesh on the delicate, well-integrated nose. Ripe Pink Lady apples and lemonade show on the surprisingly juicy sip before settling into tighter lemon peel flavors and a chalky structure.
89-91 Barrel sample. Very ripe blackberry, almost juicy fruits dominate this wine. But at the same time, there is a comfortable layer of tannins, not huge, leaving an attractive wine that is more about fruit than structure.
The second of two sweet wines produced by Marc Labat at Rousse, this certainly has a honey character, with flavors of dry fruits, a dancing acidity and a fruity aftertaste. Great as an aperitif.

There are sesame and teriyaki touches to the palate, along with charred blueberries, coffee, chocolate and firm tannins.
Maduro cigar and cherry brandy aromas power the nose on this heavily extracted, single-vineyard Sangiovese that Dave Corey makes under his Turchi label. Nothing like Chianti, aside from the decent tannins and acidity, this is all prune and plum soda on the palate. Serve with herb-crusted steak.

Everything about this Tempranillo-led blend rings true. It's full and flush on the nose, with clean berry and snappy tomato and spice notes. The mouthfeel is wiry and bold, with darts of acidity. Flavors span the red-berry spectrum, while the finish condenses in juicy, classy fashion. Drink through 2019.

Flavors of honey, raspberry and orange jam, vanilla bean and minerals mark this vibrant Viognier. It's quite rich, but is balanced with good acidity.

This wine is simple and thin, with moderate notes of red cherry and plum, but it's solidly done and the winemaking is clean.
The slightest touch of wildfire kicks off the nose, followed by aromas of hibiscus, light cranberry, dried rose petal, roasted pork shank and white pepper.

For a lighter style of the grape, it's a classic, and stays fresh for days.
Very clean and 100% varietal, it's not aggressive but it is substantial. There is a gentle sweet fig character to the fruit, also a bit of citrus rind and grapefruit. It's racy rather than woolly, if you will, and carries some of the spicy character of Pinot Gris, with very crisp acids.
Cherry and pepper are the hallmarks of Zweigelt. Here, they are very aromatic: While muted on the nose, the palate is fresh, lively and very authentic.

Aromatic cherry fruit echoes on the palate. Drink now until 2020.

The wine starts lively, almost fresh. Only after a while in the mouth do you taste the intense richness underneath. The structure is of pear skins, with white fig and sweet dried apricot syrup. The botrytis, dry at the heart of the wine, gives the whole ensemble great balance.
An appealing quaffer with notes of passion fruit, papaya and citrus. It drinks a hair off dry (1.2g/L residual sugar), with moderate concentration, and goes down easy.
Big fruit, big tannins and a delicious raspberry jelly feel are found on this complex wine. The fruit is equal to the dusty tannins, with the acidity—typical of the year—very prominent. The wine has richness though, with a tangible final burst of power.
This was the first vintage made at the new winery facility on site. It's a pleasing, lightly ripened wine with flavors of green berry and apple, highlights of pear skin, and an overall approachable, balanced style.
Yellow in color, with heavy aromas of toasted oak and popcorn. There's oxidation and mealy qualities, and the fruit is baked while the acidity is high, and thus overall it's not well balanced. Saving graces include lemon, baked corn and a so-so mouthfeel.
Combines tight tannins and acids with concentrated raspberry, cherry, Dr. Pepper cola and oak flavors to produce a vigorous, young, savory Pinot Noir. Feels silky in the mouth, yet potent in fruity concentration. There's some burn in the finish, but a good steak will take care of that. Give it a year or two to mellow.
Marked by aggressive acidity and some dusty tannins, this Pinot is not showing well now. It's just too hard and tart. But the flavors are enormously ripe, and the finish is dry and silky and long. It all suggests cellaring to let the cherries, black raspberries and Dr. Pepper cola emerge from their tomb. Better after 2011.
Earthy, mushroom and cola flavors bring a rich depth to the California-ripe raspberries and cherries in this brightly tart wine. Blended from Mourvèdre, Counoise, Grenache Noir, Sangiovese and Syrah, it's a successful, innovative wine whose silkiness invites comparisons to a fine Pinot Noir.

Roll out the barrels! This is one heavily charred, very toasty number. At first the oak seems forced, and always is it front and center. But with some time in the cellar, today's dark, resiny bitterness should subside. At least we hope it does, because the wine has structure, density and pretty good fruit. Definitely for folks not opposed to barrel influence.
Aromas of baked plum, spice and bramble give it a sweet-savory opening. The palate is a touch scratchy but also endowed with tasty raspberry, plum and spice flavors. All totaled it's slightly heavy and probing, yet the burnt caramel, chocolate and dark fruit on the finish seem right for the wine.
A very good, impressively concentrated Pinot Noir, with flashy, ripe cherry, blackberry and currant flavors. It's a little too robust right now, with an almost rustic mouthfeel, but could develop bottle complexity over the years.
Rich in blueberry and black licorice-like nuances, this is a well-flushed out and harmonious wine laced with smoke and espresso bean aromas. It has aged one year in oak to achieve a successful balance between smooth tannins and crispness.

Fermented in amphorae, the wine is rich and dense as if it had been fermented in open fermenters. The wine is ripe and very concentrated, full of black plums and generous tannins. It still needs to age, so drink from 2018.
Earth, mushroom and forest floor intrigue from sip one in this thick, densely structured effort from the great site. Cardamom, pine needle and cranberry contribute additional intrigue and spiciness to the palate, which is buoyed by bright, lengthy acidity and integrated oak.

This impressive 2004 Cabernet is still very young, firmly under the control of fine tannins, but showing ripe but structured dark plums and herbs underneath.
Light oak aromas blend nicely with white flower scents and peach notes. The palate is round, smooth and honest, with plump flavors of vanilla, pear and melon. Oaky on the finish, then dry and toasty. Nice for a warm-weather Chard.
Sharp and showing a hint of bitterness, this kicks in with midpalate flavors of red plum and cherry. There's some mint and vanilla evident from the 16 months in barrel, and for the price it delivers a lot of spicy, penetrating flavor.
A soft open blend of Fernão Pires and Verdelho produces a spicy wine with floral acidity, white-flower aromas and ripe fruitiness. It is an easy blend, refreshing and ready to drink now.
It's hard to avoid the wine's rooty, green aromas of bell pepper and spice, which fall in front of a thick, bullish, tannic palate with sweet, slightly baked berry and cassis flavors. Bulky on the finish, which deals bitter chocolate and herb flavors. 70% Cabernet Sauvignon with 15% each Merlot and Tempranillo.
A bruiser of a wine: dark tannins, brawny structure, tough and hard around the edges. That said, its tannins are true to its Nuits-St.- Georges origins in its dry core surrounded by dense fruit.
Wood aromas are out front, with notes of vanilla, dill and char, making it hard to get at the fruit. On the palate, the oak almost completely obliterates any sense of the fruit underneath as well. The variety is completely lost.
A jasmine bouquet introduces layers of bright lemon and lime in this sharply etched white, low in oak but high in acidity. Straightforward and medium bodied, it has a pronounced tartness on the finish.
Bright and tangy, this is a crisp, tight and mineral wine. It is fruity with pear and lime fruits that are caught up in the tangy texture and tense acidity. This is a wine that could age a while more, so drink from 2017.
This ripe offering smells of corn, baked apple and oak. It's creamy and woody in the mouth, with modest acidity. Flavors of creamed corn, caramel and soft melon finish plump, with a baked quality. It lacks vivacity.
This is crisp and attractively citrusy, with a touch of caramel. It's bright and fruity, with apple and lemon flavors that are well integrated with the piercingly refreshing acidity. Screwcap.

Big spice is proper for a Grüner Veltliner Smaragd wine, the richest category in the Wachau. But Machherndl also manages not to forget white fruits, a layer of acidity, and a full, but crisp varietal character.
Fairly mute on the nose, with an oily note and peachy aromas. Basic in the mouth, with good weight and balance along with oily flavors of peach and melon. Sweet and waxy on the finish, with the flavor of green banana.
Starts off with a classy bouquet of blackberry liqueur, coffee and nicely integrated oak. The fruit is very dense—almost overripe—but still delicious, with prune, dark chocolate and cocoa. Feels plush and suave on the tongue, and the juicy plum-cocoa finish goes on and on. Interesting, almost atypical in some ways, but harmonious and complete.
Here's a glassful of fruits, flowers and above all spices. Just slightly sweet, but with good acids, the wine bursts with white peach, pineapple, vanilla custard and honeysuckle flavors, and just about every Asian spice you can think of.
Iron and smoke accents wrap around densely-layered fruits with excellent concentration. It's gorgeous, deep and textured, with the focus on a rich raspberry and cherry core inside the frame of umami, leaf and seaweed.
Quite hard on the nose, with classic petrol aromas that almost smell of rubber cement. Tough and tight on the palate; it takes some effort to penetrate. Once inside there's crisp apple and lime zest. A true “nature” in every sense.

Simple and fruity, this has tangy a tangy raspberry flavor. It's light and zesty, with a fine, fresh aftertaste.

From a vineyard on Howell Mountain, the wine shows not only that area's hard tannins, but also the Duckhorn style of tough young Merlots.

91—93 Barrel sample. For Palmer, this is an atypical wine. With a much higher percentage than usual of Cabernet Sauvignon, it loses the plump character normally associated with this estate.

The nose screams Viognier, with aromas of Juicy Fruit gum, white flowers and powdered candy necklace. A peaches-and-cream palate feels lush and viscous, yet the acid manages to keep things lively through the fuzzy-textured finish.
Stewed dark strawberry, cocoa, rust, muddy earth, crushed rocks and fennel brush show on the nose of this blend of 45% Grenache, 35% Mourvèdre, 17% Syrah and 3% Cinsault.

Aged seven years in French oak, this is made from Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon grapes and then fortified with six-year-old, barrel-aged Cabernet Franc brandy. Very little is made. The experience is stellar, the dark-brown-red-hued wine opulent in red candy apple, chocolate and raspberries with ample acidity and a nuttiness to the finish. The pairing suggestion of a cigar is exactly right, though the wine will dance with nuts and cheeses or a decadent cheesecake too.

90–92 The purity of the fruit is the prime quality of this exemplary wine. It shows intensity, ripe, open tannins and generosity, finishing both fresh and firm.

This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Carmenère and Merlot holds onto its aromas on the palate, which tastes of mint, green herbs, raspberry and currant. The finish is lightly herbal.
While this is soft and fruity, it lacks all varietal resemblance. Drink it as a ripe red rather than as a Pinot Noir.
Marc Mondavi, who is the eldest son of the late Peter Mondavi, has a reputation as a bona fide water witch, hence the name of his wine project.

Candied honeydew aromas are fairly light on this blend of 41% Viognier, 33% Grenache Blanc, 14% Marsanne and 12% Roussanne, and there is also a wet wool complexity to the nose. The palate focuses more on the tense texture than overt flavors, though there are touches of Anjou pear, mango and coconut.
Delicate floral and bramble notes accent bright sour-cherry and currant notes on this rich, concentrated Pinot Noir. It's fresh and fruity on the palate with a shock of cranberry flavor and just a hint of tannins that extend the finish.

Dominated by new wood, this top cuvée from Château de Parenchère is certainly too young to drink at this stage. Its black, brooding character is very extracted and tough, although there are good hints of juiciness and sweet berry fruits.

Easy to find, with 10,600 cases produced.
Fine New Zealand Sauvignon, with passion fruit and a whole lot of snappy green aromas ranging from scallion and celery to green pepper and asparagus.

The goal here, says the winery, is to craft a wine that embodies the essence of Pinot Noir. Whatever that means, this is their priciest Pinot and the one that they have designated Reserve. It's got bulk and power, and I like the way it gathers strength in the mid-palate and on through the finish. It has pretty cherry fruit and good concentration; it does not have the textural detail of the single vineyard Corral Creek.
Rich and mineral at the same time, this deliciously powerful wine is open and generous. The structure is equally impressive, a steely core of minerality and tense stone fruits. The wood shows through with spice, but remains discreet. Age for many years.

Consulting winemaker Michel Rolland oversees this bottling in the Long Shadows series. Fans of his forward, sometimes voluptuous style may find this vintage a bit thin.

Rich and appealing, a new bottling from the winery. All the parts have yet to knit together, but they're all good, and the wine should drink well by winter 2007. New oak frames tart green apple, pineapple, kumquat and cinnamon spice flavors that are heightened by bright, zesty acidity.

Sourced from the lieu dits of Le Méal and Les Greffieux, this is a sturdy, tannic rendering of Hermitage. It's smoky, meaty and cedary upfront, with blackberry fruit and plenty of savory notes that linger through the drying finish. Drink 2020–2030.
Opening with an earthy touch of compost and wild mint, this wine develops rich flavor within its broad frame of refreshing acidity, including savory touches of cardamom, cranberry and cola. The tension between fruit and texture gives it complexity and nuanced power in the glass.
The nose of this bottling from actress Challen Cates impresses with its spicy cherry, mulberry, juniper and mace notes. The palate is silky in texture and extremely well integrated, long-lasting and layered, with shiitake mushroom, forest floor, red cherry and earthy loam flavors.
This wine begins with rustic charm, and it features notes of olive, cigar box and cedar, followed by equally earthy flavors of spicebox, tomato, vanilla and pepper. The sturdy tannins and texture are softened by a wave of red fruit. Pair this with grilled lamb or burgers.
Notions of tart redcurrant play on the nose while a delicious edge of white pepper draws you in. The same pepper entices on the palate, framing fresh, tart berry and lemon purity on the slender but memorable palate. A firm structure makes this spicy, energetic and invigorating little number irresistible. The fine mousse has verve and elegance. It finishes pure and long.
Still rather closed, this eventually reveals red berry, menthol espresso and culinary-spice aromas. The tightly wound palate offers sour cherry, sage, white pepper and star anise alongside a backbone of firm close-grained tannins that grip the finish.
The onion-skin color is pretty to look at, and even nicer is the complex aroma: earthy and rich, suggesting cherry-chocolate candy, toast and yeast. It really stands out on the palate, where the full-bodied cherry flavors are highlighted by crisp acidity. Notable for its balance, finesse and sheer charm.
This wine has structure, typical of this appellation, as well as dark black fruits and rich tannins. Acidity cuts through this ripeness, bringing in freshness. Spice and an attractive perfume come along at the end. Drink from 2019.
The nose on this blend of Grenache, Carignan and other grapes burns and smells of iodine, mushroom, olive and rustic berry fruits. High acidity and an obtuse mouthfeel house salty, briny, minerally plum flavors, while the finish runs low on fruit.
If you know Goldeneye's new Gowen Creek bottling, this is a near identical Pinot, and little wonder, for the vineyards are right next to each other. This wine dazzles with exotic, feral notes of wild blackberries and blueberries, and forest scents of pine needle, roasted mushroom, grilled meat, chocolate, anise, cinnamon, nutmeg and coriander. New oak adds even richer nuances of smoky caramel and vanilla to this compelling wine.
Colorful and jammy, with a sweet nose of red licorice, cherry cough drop and violets. Quite a simple wine, with a soft, plump body and medium tannins. Seems a touch overweight and a bit short on balance. Imported by Vias Imports.
Pinots at this price are usually pretty awful, but this bucks the trend and offers real value. It shows the silky texture, dryness and rich cherry-cola flavors you want in the variety, with an added touch of barrel age. The result is welcome. Production was 4,000 cases.
Rather nutty—almonds—on the nose, then broadening out on the palate into apricots and oranges. This is more focused and crisp than many white Hermitages, with a long, modestly tannic finish. It may age well, or it may be trying too hard and best consumed young.
La Nerthe is usually quite structured, so while the 2007 is riper and creamier than most vintages, it still retains decent acidity to balance things out. Leather, spice and cherry flavors pick up hints of coffee and chocolate on the finish. Drink it over the next 10–12 years.
This is a blend of some of the winery's best vineyards. The '06 is quite a good wine, but showcases some of the limitations of the vintage. Structurally, it's fine, with a good acid-tannin balance, but it could be more concentrated. The cherry and currant flavors are a little unfocused.
Currently, this is a mouthful of tannins and wood toast, instantly revealing its long-term aging potential. With the weight of black fruit underneath, it will be a rich, solid wine in six years time.
Distinctly sweet, this is a simple wine, with jammy berry flavors.
Fresh lemon and lime flavors are juxtaposed by dusty bramble and herb notes in this savory off-dry Riesling. Finishes briskly with a touch of green herb. Drink now through 2018.
Slightly confected on the nose, with hints of bubble gum that give way to herbal cherry-berry flavors. This plump, medium-bodied rosé finishes smoothly, making it all to easy to down more than one intended.
Imagine sucking on pebbles, and you get some idea of the mineral character of this wine. It brings concentration from late harvest fruit, with ripeness and spice.
Aromas of iron, fresh-roasted coffee beans, high-toned dried herbs, mineral, blue fruit and savory spices explode from the glass. This wine coats the palate from end to end with supple, dense fruit and savory flavors that feel sleek but still show depth. The tannins bring some heft.
Fruity hints of blueberry pie on the nose are juicy, ripe and enticing. The palate has the same generous fruit, joined by forest elements. It's a fruit-driven, juicy and ripe wine with a fresh counterpoint, a slight grip and a spicy finish.
Aromas come off as quite green, with notes of jalapeño pepper and garden herb mixed with cherry and vanilla. The palate brings broad cherry flavors. It provides appeal but the aromas and flavors seem a bit disconnected and the greenness proves distracting.
This blend of 75% Marsanne and 25% Roussanne is extremely floral, fruity and tropical on the nose, with coconut, mango, guava and tuberose scents. Acidity helps keep that ripeness in check on the palate, but the tropical flavor is powerfully persistent.
87-89 Barrel sample. Quite light, a wine in a fresh style with some attractive fruits, the tannins showing along with the bright acidity.
Fits the fashion for very pale rosé, with delicate pink color and aromas of struck flint and passion fruit. In the mouth, it's mouthwatering and plump, with peachy notes and a bit of lime zest to finish. Drink now.
Big, fruity, mature wine, showing a petrol character as well as a rounded texture and a shot of minerality. The wine is both chewy and generous, packed with fruit skins and green bean-acidity. It is ready to drink, very fresh.
A lively citrus tang balances the rounder fig, melon, toast and dried spice flavors that predominate here. Finishes evenly with medium length. It seems to be at its peak, so drink this round and well-integrated Chardonnay up now.
Jaboulet's white Hermitage is a huge success in 2007, boasting somewhat restrained aromas of pineapple, but tremendous structure and length. It's full-bodied, with a finish laced with crushed stone and citrus. Try it around 2017.
Very few Crozes manage to be mini-Hermitages, but this one succeeds admirably. Honeyed ripeness comes through, along with scents of truffle and anise in this full-bodied white, and although the finish shows a bit of toasty oak at this stage, the fruit sings longest and loudest in the end. Drink now-2020.
This is a rich style of rosé, full-bodied and packed with ripe strawberry fruit. As a happy contrast to this richness, it also has a spice and orange zest element that adds both piquancy and final crispness.
Sweet, soft and simple to the point of insipid, with jellied apricot, orange and vanilla flavors.
Red plum, rubber and leathery aromas lead to a dry, medium-full palate, with peppery spice and red fruit flavors. It's spicy on the finish, with modest depth of flavor and little to no variety in texture. A good but regular Monastrell.
The Nashville-based R.S. Lipman Company, formerly just a Tennessee distributor, comes west for this deal of a wine, with lime blossoms, pink grapefruit and Gala apple slices on the nose. The palate is clean, crisp and rounded with lime spritzer and green-apple flavors.
Sweet and simple, with an array of Lifesaver candy flavors.
Feels hot and tastes sweet, putting it at the rustic end of the Zinfandel spectrum. The official alcohol is 15.3%. At that level, of course, you also get enormously ripe berry flavors. Drink it with barbecue or meat stews.
This offers savory aromas of leather, spice, dried fruit, crème de cassis and cherry cola. It's intense and bright on the finish, with a heavy, thick quality of fruit.
With the two varieties co-fermented in concrete, this has no oak to interfere with its aromas of spice, pear and honeysuckle. It drinks off dry, seeming a bit sweeter than recent vintages, but still bringing the acidity that this region is known for.
Made in a light but complex style, this is a delightful Merlot to drink with just about anything that calls for a full-bodied red wine. It's dry and elegant, with an herbal tinge to the cherries and tobacco.
Very thin and brownish in appearance, this looks and tastes much older than it is. It has resinous notes of caramel, chestnut wood, maple syrup, dried figs and dried flowers. The resin flavors are long lasting, as is the finish.
This is the coolest and freshest of the Grand Cru vineyards. The wine is tight, steely with a nervy core of acidity that gives it a textured, structured character. It is full of energy, crisp, packed with apples and citrus and needing several years aging. Drink from 2020.
Red berry, fragrant blue flower, dark spice and a whiff of eucalyptus come together on this one. The taut, structured palate offers dried black cherry, licorice, clove and a hint of grilled sage. Firm, fine-grained tannins and fresh acidity provide balance and support. Drink 2020–2032.
Mike Januik's Cabernet Sauvignons are intellectual wines. They don't rush out to greet you with jammy, gooey flavors; instead, they are hard and compact like coiled steel. They offer potential rather than immediate pleasure. This selection is powerful and muscular, and it offers notes of metal, gravel and cassis.
Big-hearted wine, full of warm and rich fruit. It has a solid core of dusty tannins, black plum fruit flavors and a delicious, chewy, juicy texture. It does have power as well as intense fruitiness. Age for 3–4 years.
This is a fragrant and creamy white wine with pretty floral tones backed by fresh fruit and citrus. Pair it with sushi or swordfish carpaccio.
Mildly dusty and herbal on the nose, but not the least bit green or weedy. Flavors of tobacco, cassis and blackberry carry accents of cedar and vanilla, while the soft tannins make for a full, easy mouthfeel. Aged 18 months in French oak but it's not overly toasty or dark.
There is a whole orchard full of apples here: crisp and green, yellow and juicy, red and mellow and also the very aromatic red-cheeked kind. These aromas fill nose and palate and present a wonderful balance between fruity richness and absolute zesty freshness. This is lissom, dry and light bodied but full of flavor with a very mellow apple finish.
Proemio has a bouquet of mature black fruit and mushroom, layered with bitter almond. The warm palate delivers ripe raspberry and prune flavors, accented by black pepper and nutmeg. This is already developing complexity but is fast approaching its ideal drinking window, so enjoy soon.
This wine offers a spicy, green nose with tones of herbs, grass, blackberry and mint. It has a raw, thick feel with fresh fruit nuances and sour cherry on the close.

The bouquet of this kabinett is so exuberantly floral and peachy, the delicate palate struggles to keep up. It's firm with minerality, but a bit soft in acidic structure. Finishes moderately long, with a honeyed, floral touch.
An interesting and complex wine, dry and crisp, and unique among California Sauvignon Blancs. Although there's plenty of citrus fruit, it's marked by other things, such as minerals and herbs, and the sweet, olivaceous taste that the variety's Sauvignon nature contributes in a cool vintage.
A saignée-method rosé given three months in neutral French oak, this wine is dark raspberry in color. Vibrant and fresh, it offers swirls of spicy herb and wild strawberry, a hint of watermelon adding to its mouthwatering quality. Dry and savory, it also has some meat on its bones, a lovely go-to for meals of all kinds.
A Sauvignon Blanc with a Muscat aroma? That's the curious thing about this perfumed wine. It's pleasant, very fresh, perfumed like a candy shop, but has little to do with Sauvignon Blanc flavors. Screwcap.
Bouncy berry and cherry aromas are more or less standard for basic Garnacha. This wine feels a bit gummy and grabby, but not sticky. Lightly herbal, minty dark-berry flavors finish herbal, chocolaty and a touch green.
Dusty mineral tones persist throughout this deeply slatey Riesling offsetting sweet streaks of honey and tangerine. It's still a taut, slightly closed wine, but nuanced by intriguing whiffs of saffron and spice. Its intensity should develop from 2018.
Rich and decadent, this Cab is made in the ripe, flamboyant style for which Napa is famous. It's a full-bodied, dry wine, enormous in cherry jam, blueberry, chocolate, mushu plum sauce and oak flavors that are fortunately wrapped into firm, fine tannins. Best now and over the next 3–4 years.
Based in Temecula, Lorenzi is trying its hand with Napa Valley Chardonnay here and not with the best results. The wine has a dark golden color and plenty of vanilla, pear and pineapple but on the finish the citrus is so sour it's tough to recommend.
An enticing, heavy-duty blend of 40% Viognier, 40% Petit Manseng and 20% Roussanne, this is rich, round and unctuous, with bold notes of golden stone fruit, orange Creamsicle, lemon tartlet and caramelized nut. The acidity is soft across the midpalate, but it brightens on the warm, medium-length finish. To appreciate the full spectrum of aromas and flavors, don't drink this too cold.
Blue fruit stars in this juicily exuberant wine that shows upfront citrus, red cherry and a spark of campfire-like smoke. Its bristling acidity is balanced in a core of backbone-building tannin that gives it weight and depth.
Lush aromatics push a bouquet of toasted hazelnuts, citrus peel, apples and white peaches up from the glass. Flavors follow in a clean, spicy wine with a fresh and lively mouthfeel. One-third of the fruit was sourced from the estate's premier Jacob-Hart vineyard, and the wine spent 11 months in 20% new French oak.
Dull, oxidized aromas lead to a foamy, obtuse palate that makes drinking this a rough experience. Mealy white-fruit flavors result from oxidation, while this is bready and mildly green on the finish. Tasted twice with mixed results.
Aromas of beeswax and acacia carry over to the linear palate of citrus zest and toasted almond. Bright acidity and vivacious bubbles give it a vibrant edge.
Sweet grapey high-toned fruit flavors are the best things here. But along with the fruit come volatile aromas, leathery, bitter tannins, and a residual impression of balsamic vinegar.
Hailing from some of the oldest blocks at this esteemed vineyard, this standout wine opens with aromas of toasty spices, herbs, coffee, dark cherry and earth. The palate is reserved with tightly wound fruit flavors and tannins that need some time to unfurl.

Aromas of underbrush, leather, crushed blue flower, incense and balsamic notes lead the nose on this gorgeous wine. The palate delivers succulent black cherry layered with white pepper and clove alongside bracing tannins. Drink 2019–2034.
This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon is clean and almost delicate, with cranberry fruit, red licorice, dry leaves and drying tannins. It fades rather quickly, but would make a nice companion to a simple skirt steak.
There's a tough, gritty acidity and tannic toughness that makes this wine hard and chewy in the mouth. On the plus side are very ripe flavors of cherries, pomegranates and cola. Call it rustic, but it's not going anywhere, so drink up.

Arresting aromas of orange peel and peach start this clean, fresh and minerally wine. A decidedly firm acidity keeps the wine crisp and refreshing, and its tropical flavors are appetizing, but it may be too austere and even on the lean side for palates that prefer a little more curve to their SB. Still, a delicious food wine and great for a hot day.
This is a smooth, rich wine, full of tropical mango and pineapple flavors, with the lightest touch of acidity. Drink this superrich wine now.
This is extremely fruity, with an exotic bouquet of blueberry, cardamom, nutmeg and earth aromas. It feels smooth, collected and fairly rich, with savory, lightly baked flavors of black fruit. The finish remains savory, where graham cracker sweetness and roasted qualities dominate.
An excellent value, Gassier's 2010 Réserve from his Château de Nages blends 60% Grenache with 40% Syrah. The result is a wine that combines leathery, cedary notes with touches of spice and red fruit. It's supple, creamy and inviting, with a long, softly tannic finish. Drink now and for 3–4 years.
This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon is all old vine. Despite its substantial alcohol, almost 15%, the wine is still showing some lean hints of green bean. Mixed in are wild berries and plenty of oak, adding toast and smoke and spice. Black olive, black tea and coffee grounds come through in the finish.
Roasted fennel, scorched earth, leather, game and mature cherry aromas lead the nose while the palate shows French oak, mature black cherry, coffee, roasted herb and a note recalling cured meat. Brawny tannins provide the framework.
This Sauvignon Blanc has some herbal character, touches of green acidity and grapefruit flavors. It finishes hard, though somewhat metallic.

Hints of pear and grapefruit—still with a little residual fizz—make for fresh and easy drinking. They combine with midpalate texture and a touch of herby, white pepper.
This is a good followup to Merryvale's 2009. While it was barrel fermented in nearly half new French oak, it never feels overly manipulated or fussy. Marked by crisp acidity and Carneros minerality, it's an elegant, clean wine, with subtle Meyer lemon, lime and Asian pear flavors.
The nose is rather shy but reveals ripe black fruit, plum cake and baking spice. The densely concentrated palate doles out mature blackberry, crushed raspberry, allspice and licorice alongside smooth, velvety tannins. There's also the heat of alcohol.
Pretty much as good as any Cabernet out there, if not better, and at a fraction of the price you'll pay for the “cults.” If there was ever a wine made for the cellar, it's this one, the antidote for those who consider California Cabernet a simple fruit bomb. Completely dry, with exquisite tannins, its blackberry, currant, red licorice and oak-inspired flavors are massive and classic. Hard to exaggerate how good this fine wine is. Drink 2013–2020 and beyond.
Exceptionally ripe, concentrated mountain fruit as well as hard tannins characterize this fresh, young Cabernet. Through the tannic astringency, intense flavors of black currants, dark chocolate and the sweet sap of oak shine through. Needs time. Hold until 2016 and see how it's doing.

This fresh and fruity wine is soft with gentle spice. It has a crisp side as well, making for an easy, ready-to-drink wine that is well balanced.

It's a rare treat when a winery bottle-ages a wine for you, but that's exactly what's happened here. The result is a top-notch dry Aussie Riesling that's just entering its plateau of maturity, where it should stay for another 5–10 years.

The finish is chewy and thick, with vanilla and pastry flavors along with grating tannins. By no means is this wine perfect, but it offers a lot of what's good about Toro; drink now.
Although it is still young, this vintage of Cristal promises great things. There's an impressive balance between ripe fruit and crisp acidity, rich and food friendly, but also a fine apéritif.

This wine's charred nose suggests over-the-top oak. The palate is a rough road of hard grape skin tannins. Char and clove flavors blanket its savory, meaty berry fruit, finishing woody and redolent of clove.
Dense and lightly herbal on the nose, with hints of cinnamon, cassis, blackberry and tobacco. It feels powerful but not heavy or clumsy, with flavors of cassis, blackberry and chocolate. As the wine turns more concentrated and syrupy, this shows a candied character on the finish. This is a blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Carmenère and Syrah.
A lovely bottle, with rich aromas of lemon/lime and beeswax. Flavors combine ripe citrus, orange peel and English Breakfast tea. Balanced and full, with 12% Chardonnay fleshing out the midpalate.
This attractive entry level Zinfandel has good varietal character with dark berry aromas and flavors offset by cocoa accents. The palate shows good fruit, decent acidity; the wine finishes with sweet-tart berry and mild pepper flavors.
Rubbery and jumpy on the nose, with sweet, candied aromas of raspberry. Feels hard on the palate, with driving cherry, raspberry and red plum flavors that don't rise above generic in quality. Clean and forward, but doesn't say much for Carmenère.
Fresh, light and fruity with attractive red fruits and soft tannins, it's ready to drink. The aftertaste is fresh and fruity.
Surface-level lemon and tropical fruit notes give way to a fresh, clean palate. Powdery, melony flavors of green banana and papaya finish slightly oily and bitter, which is normal for the grape type. Drink immediately.
Hints of green herb accent fresh, crisp pear and apple flavors in this delicate, dancing wine. Semisweet in style, it deftly balances bracing, acidity with long, lingering swathes of honey and stone fruit.
A bit flabby and sweet, not to mention heavy on the oak, this is the sort of Pinot that has many fans for its full-bodied richness. Yet it's over the top, lacking in delicacy and restraint.
Made entirely with Chardonnay, this delivers delicate aromas of stone fruit, citrus and white almond. The bright palate offers up mature yellow apple, vanilla and a hint of lemon pastry alongside a persistent perlage.
This wine is grassy in aroma, lively and crisp in texture and tastes almost like fresh-sliced Pippin apples. It is fresh and well balanced, perfect for appetizers and seafood.
Aromas of citrus fruits, green herbs, grass and celery set up a shear lean palate with little body and pointed acidity. Tart lemon-lime flavors are crisp and scouring on the finish.
Vintner Luigi Rubino has crafted a spectacular Malvasia Bianca that bears rich and tangy aromas of peach and citrus, followed by silky smoothness and creamy, exotic fruit.
Here is a carefully aged Barolo Riserva from the Pira cru (also known as La Rocca) with dark concentration backed by rose petal, hickory smoke, root beer, wet stone and moist mineral notes. It's a big, bold and masculine interpretation with an elegant, dusty mouthfeel and polished tannins. Drink now with pork stuffed with wild mushrooms.
Red cherry and plum scents beckon in the glass. The palate is equally friendly and fruit-forward, delivering plush, ripe but refreshing flavors with generous body. Those plum and cherry notes linger, accented with hints of cinnamon and pervaded by lively, refreshing acidity.
Fairly hard on the nose, with a hint of plastic and then raspberry and plum aromas rising as it settles. The palate shows decent zest and body along with narrow flavors of berry and pepper. Finishes with mild intensity and a note of saline.
Blackberry and cassis aromas are bold and come with a coating of oak that brings vanilla and sweet plastic into the frame. A crisp, tightly wound palate shows plum and red-currant flavors in front of a snappy finish with oak spice and chocolate hints.
Tropical vanilla and pineapple notes provide this full-bodied wine with voluptuous fruit and texture. That ripeness finds its equilibrium on the midpalate, settling down into lemon peel and quince highlights that finish bright.
Fresh and fragrant, this opens with lovely scents of woodland berry, blue flower and a whiff of baking spice. The smooth, juicy palate delivers succulent black cherry, star anise, chopped herb and a hint of pipe tobacco alongside firm acidity and polished tannins.
Quite distinct from its Single Wheel companion bottlings, there's a rustic, slightly savory tone to pressed apple and pear flavors in this off-dry Riesling. It's light bodied and spry with a brisk, lemony finish.
A drinkable but unbalanced wine. It's sweet in jammy raspberries and cherries, with awkwardly tart acidity.
Made with grapes sourced from 40-year-old bush vines, this Chenin boasts savory herb notes alongside the creamy peach, fig and sweet lime fruit. The medium-weight palate shows well-integrated oak notes that complement the earthy, herbal character. The texture is somewhat nervy now, but this should really start to shine from 2014 on.
Here's a fruity blend of Sangiovese, 10% Canaiolo and 10% Colorino that doles out plum, black cherry, coffee and a hint of spice. It's simple and easy drinking, with soft, round tannins.
A bit soft and sweet, with Lifesaver candy flavors of cherries and blackberries, and a spicy finish. Okay with everyday cheeseburgers, pasta.

Violet, rose, perfumed berry and a whiff of sweet cake spice are some of the enticing scents you'll find on this impressive wine. On the delicious palate, notes of clove, cinnamon, mocha, licorice and raspberry weave seamlessly throughout the juicy black cherry core. It's elegantly structured, with fresh acidity and firm, ripe tannins. Drink 2020–2036.
This is a cheerful red wine from sunny Umbria with clean and simple tones of cherry fruit and plum backed by delicate minerals and chewy tannins. It has easy characteristics that promise a successful pairing with informal, stay-home dinners.
This is complex on the nose due to a mix of cowhide, charcoal, prune, cassis and spice aromas. It feels dense and thick on the palate, with olive, baked berry and spice flavors. The finish is peppery and a touch herbal, long and strong. This is a blend of 65% Syrah and 35% Cabernet Sauvignon.
Made with 90% Sangiovese and 10% Malvasia Nera, this vibrant red opens with aromas that recall underbrush, grilled herb, graphite, new leather and ripe berry. On the elegantly structured palate, firm, fine-grained tannins and nervous acidity support juicy wild cherry, tobacco and clove. Drink 2017–2023.
Bubbly and bright, this is a luminous Prosecco Brut with pretty floral fragrances and clean mineral nuances. It has persistent bubbling and a compact texture that ends with zesty crispness and drying mineral tones.
A decent Pinot with lots of upfront fruit, if a bit soft and short on the finish. Shows candied raspberries, cherries and spices.
The superb Clos de la Roche has produced a powerful and complex wine. It has concentrated black fruits and solid tannins while also showing a beautiful velvet texture that will develop into a sumptuous wine. It's still in the first youthful flush and needs many years. Drink from 2020.
After a waxy opening, the bouquet unveils honey and peach aromas that are totally inviting. It feels thick but not cloying, and the honeyed flavors of banana, peach and dulce de leche are a prelude to the creamy, thick and deeply layered finish. Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and Albariño make the blend.
This has a mineral structure that's laced with acidity and red currant flavor. It has a tight texture and a crisp feel, showing a serious, austere side of Beaujolais. It's all balanced by the bright, crisp finish.
Barossa fans should be seeking out the well-priced offerings from Ross Estate. This Grenache, from vines more than 80 years old, starts off with dark notes of coffee and plum, then gradually reveals dried cherries accented by hints of spice. The texture is creamy and lush, the finish mouthwatering and long. Drink now–2012.
This wine offers clean aromas of freshly-peeled clementine. Flavors of white peach, apricot, quince and a pleasing bouquet of flowers offer a nice interplay on the tongue, with smooth tannins that continue into the slightly chalky finish.
This has brisk, tingly acidity and rich, toasty new oak flavors, plus mineral and fruit notes. Try this in 2015 as it could become surprisingly complex.
There's an explosion of rich, intense fruit here: dried prunes, black plums and even some licorice. The wine is attractively edged with wood, giving a fine, ripe finish.
Dried cherries, dried blueberries, fudge and licorice combine into a silky, sexy nose on this blend of 60% Syrah, 28% Petite Sirah, 5% Zinfandel, 3% Merlot, 2% Malbec and 2% Tannat. The palate is sleek though thin, with light boysenberry, dark slate and hints of vanilla.
Bold but also harmonious, this full-bodied, dry wine blends dark fruit flavors with mild spice and chocolate notes for a mouth-filling, palate-pleasing and attractively complex personality. Extra bottle age helps it bring together several flavor threads that are fun to pick out.
Rubbery, dense aromas are murky and on the green side as leafy, tomato notes rise up. Feels a bit thick and heavy, with herbal, sticky, sweet berry flavors mixed with a syrupy grab. Carries its weight in plodding fashion; a sweet and unctuous Cab.
This is the driest, most elegant and balanced of Ottomino's new single-vineyard Zinfandels. It has a Cabernet-like structure, although the wild blackberry, mulberry, plum and exotic spice flavors are all Zin, as are the dense, sandpapery tannins. Good now with upscale rich beef and cheese dishes, and should develop gradually in the bottle for many years.
An interesting, complex wine with the peppery aroma of a fine Northern Rhône. But the softness and forward fruit are all California. Tastes like blackberry tea with a shot of cassis followed by a shot of cocoa. Sweet oak is there, too.
Lemon and apple aromas are basic, while the palate is spongey and offers only mild acidity to boost slightly mealy citrus and persimmon flavors. Finishes flat as a board.
Apple, petrol and mineral define the nose. The lime and apple on the tongue are standard and crisp. Medium weight on the palate, with some sweetness. Imported by Freixenet USA.
Aromas and flavors of fennel, black cherries, raspberries and chocolate mark this soft, easy Zin. Nice with a juicy cheeseburger slathered with ketchup.
Blackberry, cherry and cedar start this rich, elegant red from Tselepos. On the palate, rounded flavors of cedar, vanilla, black berry and spice are well integrated and juicy. The wine finishes with touches of wood and smoke.
This is a beautiful, rounded and soft wine with sweet fruits and gentle tannins. Embedded in the intense fruitiness, a solid structure will help the wine age. Drink from 2016.
This is a complex young wine, made in the white Bordeaux style. It has been barrel fermented and aged on the lees. Marked by crisp, mouthwatering acidity, it shows a grassy, hay quality that dries out the citrus fruit and apple fruit, giving the wine a bone-dry feel. Very fine and near the top of Napa Valley Sauvignon Blancs.
A much more concentrated version of the regular bottling. The fruit is still raspberries and cherries, but there is more focus and power, and it’s wrapped in smooth milk chocolate. A flat-out delicious bottle of Merlot.
A very pretty wine, dry and delicious in cherry pie filling, cocoa, spice and sandalwood flavors. The tannins are just perfect, rich and soft, providing a velvety texture to the richness. Cabernet Sauvignon constitutes 11% of the blend, but the wine still shows that Cabernet Franc, by itself or almost nearly, needs something more to give it extra oomph.
In recent years, the Gardiniers of Phélan-Ségur seem to have become preoccupied with wood, generally too much. It's the same in 2006, and it is a shame, because everything else about this wine is balanced—the fruit is ripe and sweet and there is some freshness from a cranberry note. It just needs the wood to become less dominant.
This is the first release of the new vintage from Soléna. Primary fruit flavors of strawberry and raspberry seem a bit disjointed, and there is a hole in the midpalate. A suggestion of rubber tire sets in as the wine finishes. More bottle age is in order.
Ripe, forward flavors of raspberry and cherry jam and spice mark this blend of Tempranillo, Grenache and Mourvèdre. Dry and crisp, it has tannins that make the palate pucker, and it calls to be paired with beef, lamb or pork.
Smoky, intense and petrolly on the nose, this medium-bodied Riesling goes 180 degrees on the palate, where the flavors are the more typical apple and lemon-lime. It's a touch oily, finishing with a tangy, citrusy edge.
Historically one of Friuli's most lauded varieties, native grape Ribolla Gialla is now being revived. This polished wine starts with delicate floral aromas of peach blossom, citrus and a whiff of pastry cream. The palate delivers mature apple, lemon zest and an almond note brightened by fresh acidity.
Lots of spice, leather and cherry character. Intense on the palate with mixed berry and violet flavors. Medium bodied, with fresh acidity on the medium finish and chewy tannins. Best after 2010.
The aromas are light on this wine with notes of dried herbs, mocha and anise. It's soft and elegant in its styling but with rich fruit flavors and dry, chalky tannins.
Fruity enough, with white peach and pineapple flavors enriched with a dollop of smoky oak and a chalky minerality in the finish. This is a fine everyday Chardonnay with some real complexity and elegance.
Almost creamy, despite its lively acidity, this SB offers tropical fruit flavors and white pepper, finishing with pear and more spice. Simple but enjoyable; would go well with summer salads. Imported by Pasternak Wine Imports.
Iron Horse's estate Chard is a remarkably consistent wine. Never overoaked, superripe or heavy, it always has an elegant minerality. The '06, from a coolish vintage, is flavored with green apples, Meyer lemons and Bosc pears.
This wine is a blend of fruit from Summit View, Klipsun and Doval vineyards. Aromas of wood spice, purple fruit, vanilla and exotic spice are followed by tart cranberry and cherry flavors, with the midpalate dipping in concentration. The tannins bring quite a bit of grip.
92–94. Barrel sample. Newly promoted to Premier Grand Cru Classé in 2012, this is a fine, concentrated wine, showing great style. It has weight and a delicious juiciness that is sustained by firm, dry tannins. Already a beautiful wine.
Serpico is a beautiful but also modern expression of Aglianico (the grapes come from ancient vines in the Taurasi area) that opens with dark notes of blackberry, crushed stone, chocolate, rum cake, licorice and cola. The mouthfeel is smooth, firm and very rich.
Stewy, earthy and muddled on the nose, this gran reserva from a notoriously cold and wet vintage comes across as forced, as if long hangtime was sought to offset poor weather conditions. Stewy flavors of plum and spicecake finish flat and heavy, with tannic thud.
This represents the winery's attempt to recreate a Côte Rôtie-like wine. It's very similar to the regular bottling, with lots of ripe, fancy fruit, but it's oakier, with 50% new American barrels. What really distinguishes it, though, is its balance. The only complaint, and it's a minor one, is that the tannins are so soft, and the acidity so low, that it's a bit flabby. Most people won't notice or care.
Some aspects of this wine have changed since the 2014 vintage: the alcohol is lower, and the exposure to new French oak (50%) is higher. There's something amiss, however. While light strawberry fruit and hints of chicken stock show on the palate, there's a foreshortening and feeling of dilution on the finish.
This blend of 75% Cabernet Sauvignon and 25% Merlot smells 100% Chilean, meaning there's green tobacco, olive, eucalyptus and earthy berry aromas draped all over the bouquet. A linear, zesty palate ranks as fresh, while lightly oaked red currant and plum flavors finish with spice and vanilla notes along with tomatoey acidity.
Hard in tannins, with a baked, pie-filling quality to the blackberry and black cherry fruit, this bone-dry Syrah is made for drinking now with robust foods, like burgers or lasagna.
The lemon-lime nose is true to form, and the palate is perfectly zesty, with citrus dominating a full package of Prosecco-like flavors. Slightly sweet later on, which carries the finish. Plucky and solid. Imported by Paterno Wines International.
Juicy aromas of black currant and other black fruits are followed by forward, sweet, lush fruit flavors. Grainy tannins provide the spine.
Nice and silky in the mouth, but raw in green acids, with a tart, almost sour taste to the cherries and mint. Drink now.
Raisin and cassis aromas come across sweet and ripe but also flat. This feels mildly tannic and abrasive, with herbal plum and raspberry flavors setting up a finish that's lightly green and woody.
This classed growth is taking on a new life after years of not achieving its potential. With this vintage, the team from Château Chasse-Spleen has taken charge, and it shows in the structured density of the tannins, maybe edged with austerity, but also based upon rich, black fruits and a mouthful of vivid acidity.
Tastes like Chardonnay with bubbles and yeast. With a slightly sweet finish, this bubbly has flavors of limes, green apples and lees.
Intensely toasty on the nose, along with powerful menthol notes that persist from start to finish. This full-bodied, almost syrupy-concentrated Shiraz features plums and blackberries that take on a slightly medicinal cast, finishing on a fresh, resiny note. Try after 2016.
With a gold color and heavy, pithy aromas that are becoming oxidized, this is a mature, highly stylized Albariño. It's also a touch flat, with flavors of bitter citrus and nectarine pit. Overall this is more leesy and mature than vital and outwardly delicious.
A super Campania blend of Coda di Volpe, Fiano, Greco and Falanghina (basically all of the region's white indigenous grapes), Mastro is a fabulously crisp, cheerful and enjoyable wine. It drinks like a charm with a no-fuss, direct approach.
This estate-grown white is consistently yummy, tangy in lemon peel and fresh-squeezed lemon, with a splash of fresh grapefruit. Dry and crisp, it finishes refreshingly, an ideal wine for light appetizers and most rewardingly, raw oysters.
Smoky aromas of black plum, wild berry and clove precede a rich, layered, saturated palate that's creamy in the long run. Woody, spicy flavors of clove, pepper, chocolate and plum finish similarly, meaning this superb blend of Tempranillo, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon is still in a youthful phase. Drink from 2018–2030.
An estate-bottled, unfiltered 100% Cabernet, it’s an open, loose-knit wine, with soft, plummy fruit, some vanilla-cream notes and a sweet finish.
After you've had oceans of Chardonnay and don't think there's room for a drop more, along comes a wine like this to change your mind. It's not just the peach, pear and tropical fruit, or the honeyed, vanilla-scented buttered toast, or the oriental spices, or the clean acidity, or the rich, creamy texture. It's all of these together, in a balanced package.
Earthy notes and yeasty richness swing along the aromatic lemon bouquet. On the very slight, slender palate these flavors appear linear and leave a feeling of near weightlessness. Savory tones of yeast make themselves felt on the long, gossamer finish.
The aromas bring notes of toast, spice and dark fruit. The flavors are pitch black, showing the warmth of the vintage and appellation along with their appeal.
One of the ripest Farrell Pinots I've ever tasted, this bottling, from the well-known Allen Vineyard, is enormously fruity. It was a very hot, fast vintage, and the fruit here is enormously rich, almost dessert-like in baked cherry pie and rum-soaked currant flavors. It is, however, fully dry. Drink this decadent Pinot with beef tenderloin served in a wine or fruit reduction sauce.
Opaque to the point that it looks like syrup. It smells severely of black olive, juniper and green herbs. It feels tannic and tastes fully roasted and herbal, with bitter chocolate on the finish. This is big and bulky; the fruit takes a back seat to the wine's herbal, prickly side. Carmenère-based, with smaller parts of Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot.
This elegant wine boasts a floral and spice fragrance of crushed violets and clove. The bright palate offers juicy dark cherry with cinnamon and cake spices. Supple tannins reveal a surprisingly accessible side to Serralunga, home to the most structured Barolos. Drink 2015–2025.
Barrel grain and spiced apple are the key aromas. This is round, chunky and not showing a lot of structure or backbone. Oaky flavors of butterscotch and baked apple end with a note of caramel.
Floral and surprisingly bright, this wine is driven by sharply etched acidity and citrus—its flavors balanced and complementary. Red cherry and raspberry find companionship in seasonings of cinnamon and clove, the texture slightly leathery and bold.
Tobacco, earth, sage and pencil notes contribute inviting character to this full-bodied, structured red. Softly layered and rounded on the palate, it offers moderate complexity and a grippy, leathery finish.
There's plenty of freshly squeezed lemon and apple flavor in this crisp, racy wine. Behind the honey and petrol aromas, however, there's a slightly industrial, rubbery note lingering in the backdrop. Nice tart acidity finishes with a hint of sour apple candy on the palate.
Coconut and vanilla aromas announce new oak, and along with that there are aromas of blackberry and toast. In the mouth, tangy flavors sit on top of standard berry and spice, while acidity returns on what amounts to a lean, sharp finish.
A palate-friendly wine tasting like chocolate-covered cherries and raisins, Cinder's Idaho-sourced Syrah has a refined, elegant balance. Fruity and forward, it makes for enjoyable drinking right now.
Here's a dark, big, rich, dry, oaky Pinot Noir. It's huge in black cherry, cocoa, cola, vanilla and spice flavors that dramatically swamp the palate. It's a complex, elegant, silky wine now, delicious on its own, and likely to intensify for four or five years. From Caymus.
Sorbe is one of the leading figures in the two small appellations of Reuilly and Quincy. His Reuilly is honeyed, with fresh mandarin and citrus flavors, leading to a soft, open wine, great as an apéritif.
An intensely fruit-driven nose of raspberry and blueberry is touched with tobacco and forest floor. Almost a bit sweet-tasting in the mouth, with ripe tannins and candied cherries wrapped in pie crust.
Roasted and rustic smelling, with baked, brushy berry aromas. The palate is fresh, forward and well focused, with briary, roasted flavors of earthy berry and chocolate. Finishes with toasty oak flavors, chocolate and herbs along with heat and spice.
This is a blend of Syrah, Petite Sirah and Viognier. The reds bring robust, full-bodied and dry flavors of raspberry and cherry jam, while the Viognier adds a burst of citrusy brightness. It feels spicy on the palate, a versatile table wine to drink now.
Like other wines from Blin, this seems to have some good bottle age, which has rounded out the naturally crisp character of the wine. The tight citrus flavor is soft, giving a fragrant, mouthfilling feel.
A pleasant step up for Nobilo's top-of-the-line Sauvignon, offering slightly smoky, herbal but balanced aromas and plenty of melon and stone fruit flavors. It's full-bodied and rich, with a long, refreshing, slightly herbal finish.
This blend of Syrah with 10% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Cabernet Franc falls on the gamy, funky side of the Syrah spectrum. Scents of chicken yard, compost, soy and balsamic mingle with a tight vein of black cherry fruit. Sufficient acidity suggests giving it a little more bottle age, which should help to pull it together.
Scorched soil, black-skinned berry, worn leather and dried herb aromas come together here. The jammy palate is already rather evolved, offering dried black cherry, clove and star anise alongside bracing tannins. Give the tannins a few more years to unclench then drink up to catch the remaining fruit.
Less intense than the other samples, but once you dig your nose into theglass those fresh peach and soapy notes translate into a correct and genuine Moscato d'Asti. Crisp and peachy in the mouth. Imported by Vieux Vins, Inc.
Fragances of wild berries, bramble and honeysuckle pave the way for flavors of cherry cola, toffee and tangerine zest. This is soft and round in the mouth, with tannins that are almost imperceptible at first yet last through the finish, hand-in-hand with remarkably bright acidity.
With a beautiful, newly inaugurated winery in place, Rocca di Montemassi's Sangiovese-based Le Focaie will be a wine to watch in the future. This vintage showcases sweet, plump cherry, vanilla and well-integrated oak nuances. A plush, velvety feel characterizes the mouth.
From three vineyard sites, this wine benefits from the skill of its blender, who composed lemon and lime fruit crispness with more sultry full-bodied creaminess to the texture. Apple skin and herb complete the picture, finished off by a lovely accent of subtle spice.
This is a very fine Cabernet, a bit too young for complete enjoyment now due to tough mountain tannins, but there's a fleshy opulence to the fruit. Totally dry, the wine feels rich and balanced, and is Bordeaux-like in its feminine elegance, suggesting a fine St.-Julien. Hold until 2008.
Good price for this dry, crisp and stylish Pinot Grigio. Easy to drink as a cocktail sipper, with lemon and lime sour candy flavors that sweeten toward the end with a hit of honey.
Extremely light in citrusy flavor, leaving a palate impression of alcohol, acidity and heat. There's a taste of lemons on the finish.
In a gigantically heavy bottle, this Mendocino Merlot, grown in the Potter Valley, struggles to eke out currant and cranberry aromas and is perfectly fine but lacking in depth and vibrancy.
Subtle aromas of grapefruit, citrus zest and kiwi float out of the glass. The radiant palate is more expressive, doling out juicy yellow peach, honeydew melon, nectarine and sage. A mineral note backs up the finish.
This is a full-bodied, richly textured blend of 80% Roussanne, 10% Grenache Blanc and 10% Clairette. Toasted marshmallow, pineapple and peach flavors finish long and mouthwatering.
Soft and gentle, with herb, coffee and cherry flavors. Oak adds vanilla and smoky notes. The flavors are marvelous, yet you wish the wine had a firmer structure. Finishes dry.
An unexpected touch of caramel butterscotch or candied fruit could indicate very mild oxidation although the jury is still out. Otherwise, the wine does a good job of presenting austere aromas of old spice, worn leather and dried fruit.
A smooth, easy wine, fresh, with a crisp citrus edge and a broad texture. It is the perfect wine for seafood, with its final tight acidity.
Spicy and a little hot right after opening, this wine breathes into shape, firming up with classic Red Mountain fruit flavors of plum and cherry, laced with graphite and accented with new oak. This is as muscular and authoritative as Merlot can get, and priced at a third of what comparablebottles from California cost.
There is a barnyard feel to this wine, from its rustic aromas through the edgy berry fruit to the final flavors of acidity and beetroot. The character gives licorice and spice as well as blackberry fruits.
Concentrated white fruits, layering melon, pear and red apples with the balancing acidity. For a Chablis, it is ripe and opulent, a delicious already approachable product of the warm year. It does have texture to age well.
From Bisquertt, this is a saturated, earthy, berry-packed version of Carmenère. The palate is ripe and fruity, with a ton of spunky berry fruit wrapped in a nice coating of smooth oak. Chocolate and raisin flavors are nice finishing notes. Complete stuff, with just a tiny bit of outlying acidity.
Fresh and tight aromas of lemon-lime, baking soda, wet cement and Gala apple show on the nose of this crisp and nervy bottling. Grippy, mineral-driven tension frames the palate, with flavors of wet slate, green apple and Key-lime rind. The crisp and intriguing texture is the star here.
Bursting with floral aromas, this loads the palate with flavors of rose petals, lychee, grapefruit and spice. Finishing dry, it has outstanding concentration, tension and length.
Woodsy aromas lead the charge, followed by mocha, smoke, raspberry and plum. There's good acidic lift to the palate and toasty, dark flavors of roasted berry, cassis and chocolate. Finishes lively and bright. Solid Cabernet for the money; a good wine to match with beef.
This is a blend of the best barrels of the vintage, in this year consisting of fruit primarily from Howell and Diamond mountains, with a touch of estate-grown Merlot. It offers astounding levels of richness and concentration alongside a nuanced approach to bold black fruit and spicy earth, its aromas of blackberry and clove peppered in wild violet. It impresses immediately but also pleads for more time in bottle; enjoy best 2020 through 2028.
Loimer, better known as a producer in Kamptal, also has vines in the Thermenregion, south of Vienna. This perfumed, smoky wine is deliciously juicy, a welter of red berries balanced with acidity. Great fruit with just enough tannins to ensure structure. Glass stopper.
Made in a very ripe, extracted style, this eccentric wine has flavors of apricots, or more precisely, apricot marmalade on buttered toast, because it's also oaky. It's dry and crisp in acids. A bit unusual, but in its own way, a good wine.
This wine has a slightly lighter color than usual, aromas that resemble black plums and red cherries, and similar flavors. It is medium bodied, moderately tannic in texture and a good choice for a large crowd.
This organically farmed wine by Barone Pizzini shows bright aromas of citrus, cut grass, kiwi and white flower. Verdicchio is one of the promising white grapes that puts central Italy on the world wine map.
A blend of Syrah (70%), Grenache (25%) and Mourvèdre, this tantalizing wine offers a near endless list of aromatic descriptors, from white pepper to smoked meat, currant, mineral, licorice, coffee and dried herbs, seeming to evolve with each swirl. The palate is layered and rich with plum, pomegranate and lingering dark fruit flavors. It drinks best at a cool 62 degrees.
Caramelized oak and tangerine jam flavors give this Chardonnay a honeyed sweetness that would appeal consumers who enjoy modern-style wines. The high alcohol gives it a peppery burn.
The subtle scent of vanilla soufflé translates as a soft mouthfeel and buttered toast flavors, resulting in a wine ready for meals both casual (roast chicken and mashed potatoes) or upscale (nut-crusted halibut atop polenta). There's ample acidity, but it still falls in the traditional California Chardonnay camp.
Soft and sweet, almost off-dry, with flavors of blackberries, cherries, chocolate, root beer and spices. A multiple-variety blend based on Syrah.
This is a well-made, typical Rioja Crianza. Aromas of saucy cherry and cassis come with a mild horsey element. A solid mouthfeel with firm tannins supports earthy, savory plum, berry and spice flavors. A drying finish runs long and grabby.
A rather closed nose yields some earthy notes mixed with citrus. The palate comes across as tart but counteracts with a slightly oily texture. This wine is fresh and clean but should be drunk soon.
This warm, ripe wine offers good acidity, but its main thrust is rich yellow fruits and spice. It is drinkable now, but will develop well over the next few months to give a rounded, generous character. Drink from 2017.
Steeped plum and chopped herb scents lead the nose and follow through to the rather lean palate, which is marked by red cherry and a hint of star anise. Youthfully assertive tannins provide a firm finish. This needs a few more years to come around.
A little rugged in the mouth, with some fierce tannins, but otherwise a pretty good Cabernet-based wine. The berry-cherry and currant flavors will benefit from an hour or two of airing.
Shows lovely, complex aromas of plum and cedar, accented with hints of brown sugar, chocolate and spice. It's medium in weight, developing flavors of fresh herbs and cherry on the palate before ending with lingering notes of cherry and soft, gentle tannins. Imported by Vineyard Brands.
Dried rose, mature berry and dark cooking spice aromas lead the nose while the palate offers raisin, black tea, dried cherry, mocha and a hint of orange zest. Assertive, fine-grained tannins carry through to the firm finish. Drink sooner rather than later to capture remaining fruit.
Aromas of scorched earth, leather, mature black fruit and a touch of graphite lead the nose on this full-bodied, straightforward wine. The solid palate offers up plum and dried black cherry alongside astringent tannins that give it a clipped finish.
On the austere side, the tannins dry and firm. The fruit flavors echo the severe character, with red currant flavors and a slight vegetal edge.
Hints of overripe peach and mealy apple indicate a rich, ripe style of rosé, but are immediately followed by accents of green melon, plum and menthol, adding balance and tension. Medium weight, with ample acidity that keeps the ripe fruit flavors balanced and refreshing through the finish.
Rich and baked smelling, with hints of marzipan, tobacco, earth and black fruits. Feels chewy and deep, with fresh acidity and bright cassis, black cherry and blackberry flavors touched up by chocolate and spice. Penetrating and choppy on the finish; 70% Cabernet with 30% Merlot. Drink now through 2013.
This vintage of Sophia is almost two-thirds Merlot, with smaller amounts of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Hints of hickory smoke and mint mark the nose, while the palate is more about ripe black cherries and vanilla. It's full bodied and round in the mouth, with supple tannins that make it approachable now. Drink now–2023.
This is a hard edged wine, solid and firm, with dry tannins and only a hint of fruity acidity. It does have weight, so it could soften with age.
A blend of Viognier (60%), Marsanne (25%) and Roussanne, this wine displays fragrant aromas of white flowers, orange peel, almond and citrus. The palate shows an elegant styling along with absolutely impeccable balance that keeps the interest high. Orange peel notes linger on the finish.
Black cherry, vanilla, wet rocks, anise and damp herbs show on this take on the rare but increasingly popular grape. It's a tart and more medium-bodied expression of this often black-as-night varietal, showing boysenberry, a touch of tar and herbal spice on the palate.
Made with Sangiovese, Canaiolo and Colorino grapes from old vines, this delicate wine offers a clean and polished sensation in the mouth backed by fragrant tones of sweet almonds, small berries and blue flowers. The wine would pair well with pasta or risotto.
Simple and peachy, with a mix of sweet and citric flavors. Tastes candied and tropical, with banana coming onto the finish along with orange and pineapple. A lot of fruit and flavor; just not much sophistication. A quaffer, pure and simple.
Ripe fruit aromas show alongside an equally rich, creamy palate. This wine has attractive lemon and crisp apple flavors, touched by wood to give a smooth, rich aftertaste. Drink from 2018.
Features sweet fruit, plum, prune and a savory element of spice and smoke; loads of leather and tobacco as well. Deep rich, concentration and a plush, velvety feel. Oak tones must still integrate, but promise a nice future.
Hawke's Bay isn't known as a Pinot Noir region, but this winery perennially turns out respectable efforts. The 2007 is intense and beefy, with flavors that run toward black cherry, cola, chocolate and coffee. It is slightly astringent on the finish, so offer it alongside red meats.
Just released, young and tight, this widely available (25,000 case) Oregon Pinot shows the strengths of the 2008 vintage. The cranberry and raspberry fruit has plenty of supporting acidity, while the barrel regimen—a mix of new, one-, two- and three-year-old French oak—brings in cedar, smoke and caramel highlights.
This dry, full-bodied Syrah is impressively packed with blackberry, currant, crispy bacon and black pepper flavors. On the downside is an overripeness suggesting raisins, with the tannic bitterness of raisin skins. Drink now.
Sharp in acidity, and not entirely ripe, with a wintergreen mint zest to the cherries. Needs a rich, well-marbled steak to soften it.
Dense, juicy and spicy, this easygoing and easy-to-like wine will please a range of palates. Blackberry and black cherry dominate on the palate, softened by fine tannins and integrated oak.
Soft and creamy, this gentle sparkling wine has some ripe apple fruits and attractive acidity. A yeasty aftertaste is less attractive.
With its memorable squat bottle, this is a classic 20-year old tawny. It retains memories of fruitiness but is focused on concentrated acidity, dried-fruit flavors and textural richness. Drink now, but it can be kept for a few weeks after opening.
This is a varietal Roussanne that's pungent with herbs, honey and vanilla, along with strong flavors of black tea and oak that somewhat overpower the fruit. Waxy on the finish. Serve chilled and drink young.

This Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah blend from the Warner Springs area in the mountains northeast of San Diego shows grape soda and blackberry chews on the juicy nose. The palate gains tartness accented by black pepper and crushed oregano.
Decent, everyday Pinot, with good varietal character, if not especially complex. The wine is dry, silky and crisp, with modest cherry and cola flavors.
This is a very opulent bottling by Steve Martell, who blends 83% Syrah, 16% Grenache and 1% Mourvèdre to deliver aromas of black-plum sauce, hot licorice, hoisin and buttery pie crust. Rounded milk chocolate flavors show on the sip, melted atop the rich and ripe core of black cherry and cassis. It's a tad hot on the tongue.
The third wine of Château Valandraud, this is a lighter version of the estate. With its generous tannins and concentration, it is smoky, full of blackberry fruits and the potential to age for a few years. Drink from 2020.
Pear and melon aromas are pleasant enough, followed by tart fruit and peppery spice on the palate. But the wine comes across as slightly disjointed, showcasing a broad—almost fat—attack, followed by excessively crisp acids on the finish. Imported by USA Wine West.
This spent 11 months in 41% new oak, and there's a tasty lick of caramel running through the midpalate. The fruit catches some purple plum and plenty of Bing cherry, with a dark chocolate frame around svelte tannins.
Aromas of dates, leather and spice are followed by cherry, licorice and medicine-cabinet flavors backed by lightly dry tannins. Drink now.
Rose petal, violet, red berry, white pepper and eucalyptus scents meld together on this bright, structured expression of Nebbiolo.

It's already accessible but will also age gracefully over the next several years. Drink through 2024.
Aromas of warm peach custard meet with baked yellow apples, banana flambé and caramelized fruit on the nose. Baked pears and slightly sour tangerine rinds show on the intriguing sip that may need some time in bottle to become fully appreciated.
Beautifully rich and saturated, this is a creamy white wine with thick aromas of honeysuckle, pear, cantaloupe melon and Golden Delicious apple. Made from Greco di Tufo, the wine glides with dense smoothness over the palate.

This wine hits all the right notes—gamy spice, a touch of minerality, savory, rich fruit. A touch of oak adds muscle and the overall package is satisfying.

After a rough, rubbery start to the aromatics, herbal spice and dark fruit notes come out. This shows a racy palate with high acidity. Herbal red-plum flavors are scratchy, while the finish loses fruit and replaces it with espresso bitterness.
One of the most drinkable Tokays is this entry-level offering from Campbells. It's only light amber in color, suggesting its youth, while the fruit comes through as citrus and apricot laced with clove and caramel. It's sweet but not overbearing.
This savory and meaty red wine is made from air-dried Nebbiolo grapes much in the same style as Amarone. It opens with thick tones of pipe tobacco, smoked bacon and dried blackberry fruit. It shows power, density and personality.
Lovely tree fruits and a hint of honeycomb come through in this well-balanced Pinot Gris. It offers both easy drinkability and surprising depth of flavor, with a lingering finish that should cost you significantly more.
From a trio of vineyards the winery otherwise vineyard-designates, including Spring Hill, Saltonstall and Nobles, this Pinot is rustic in truffled earth and dried herb, the earthiness of the Pommard clone grapes out in full force.
The intense nose of this white Rhône varietal wine offers flower-shop and orange notes and an almost Gewürztraminer-like spiciness. Similar tart-sweet flavors prevail on the medium-weight palate, and high, almost cutting—acidity shows. The spicy finish has a bitter note and decent length. Unique and recommended for the adventurous palate.
Very dense wine, its tannins solid and concentrated. The structure is the leader here, with the young fruit showing through as black plum skins and crushed strawberries. This is a firmly tannic wine, needing aging.
Produced only in top years, this rich wine is impressive. It has great fruit, ripe strawberries and red currants bringing juicy fruitiness. There is also a more serious mineral texture that comes with tangy acidity. Age this wine for a few more months and drink from the end of 2017.
Herbal and foresty up front, this Bordeaux blend smells of fig, caramel and berry fruits. Big, tannic and chunky on the palate, this has toasty, chocolaty, burnt flavors and a blackened finish. This offers a lot of power and fruit but it's brusk.
A ripe, brambly Zin with 25% Petite Sirah, this holds a richness of cinnamon, dark chocolate and leather at its core. Sprightly in acidity, it has an elegant sense of restraint, yet offers subtle tannic grip on the finish. Smooth, it'll take on additional nuance through 2020.
From a vineyard atop the Cuesta Grade, this atypical yet awesome blend of 68% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Petite Sirah, 5% Petit Verdot and 2% Malbec shows blackberries, beef char, pencil lead, coffee beans and a touch of dried dill on the nose. Though flavors are still unfolding, there's plenty of blueberry, violet, lavender, soy, dried strawberry and night jasmine on the palate.
Subtle yellow peach and mineral tones on the nose intensify on the palate of this surprisingly tropical kabinett. Mouthwatering acidity pulses a laser beam through layers of sweet mango, melon and tangerine, extending a long, spine tingling finish. It's delightful now, but should keep drinking well through 2025.
Overpowering, intense barrel aromas are resiny and fully toasted. This oaky Chardonnay is flush and textured in the mouth. Flavors of resiny, raw wood are front and center, followed by woodspice and hickory. A final heaping of oak is poured onto this wine's barrel-heavy finish.
This is a rich, ripe Condrieu that manages to avoid seeming excessively weighty or oily. The suggestion of grilled apricot and pineapple slices is balanced by mouthwatering acidity and a slightly peppery, textural grip on the long finish. Drink by 2016.
A moderate level of earthiness is found in this approachable wine, which is friendly and rounded in baked cherry, plum, cola and velvety smooth layers of texture. It pleases for its brisk acidity and integrated oak.
This light-pink Malbec smells dry, oaky and bereft of fruit. A plump palate feels a touch resiny from six months of American-oak aging, while this wine tastes vaguely of wood, vanilla, cherry Pixie stick and powdered sugar.
This wine is the perfect model for midlevel Chilean Cabernet. It costs under $15 yet it overdelivers. The nose is firm and toasty, with serious berry and cassis aromas. In the mouth, it sings its way through wavy raspberry and vanilla flavors. Balanced and rich, with some creaminess and depth.
Peachy up front, with a pithy, dry, diluteness to the nose. The palate is wet but a little bland and innocuous, with nectarine, generic citrus and pith flavors. For a blend of Viura, Viognier and Sauvignon Blanc, it works well enough.
Oaky aromas of maple and molasses are overriding and ponderous. In the mouth, this is tannic and punishing. Flavors of coconut and chocolate are overly dominant, leaving nothing but candied stickiness and wood resin on the finish.
An herbal undertone lurks beneath richer, layered concentrations of big tannin and toasty oak in this 100% varietal wine. Meaty and bold, it highlights the variety's ability to be extracted, fruity and nuanced in dried herb, cedar, graphite and sage.
This bottling immediately shows a strong new barrel influence, though only a single barrel out of five total was unused. The toasty, coffee grounds flavors lie comfortably over the top of the plummy, dark purple fruit. Young and plump, packed with flavor, this is the more ageworthy of the two Kerloo Syrahs. It also seems to show more of the gamy, earthy side of the grape.
Full-bodied and richly textured, this more than delivers at its suggested retail price. Grilled plums, baking spices and mocha notes provide plenty of interest, finishing creamy and supple. Drink now–2020.
An intensely black-colored wine, with dark, smoky tannins to match. It does have a juicy, ripe sweet berry fruit element, laying under the surface tannins. With this power, it needs several years to develop.
Tough and gritty now, with dominating acids that give the wine a hard mouthfeel. Yet there's some impressive red currant, tangerine, ruby grapefruit and cola fruit in there. Will it develop polish and softness? Hard to tell. Decant if you drink now.
The alcohol is overwhelming here in an otherwise fragrant wine with strong aromas of cola spice. This Petit Verdot is medium-bodied and very much happy to display its 18 months spent in new American oak.
A simple, thin wine, with vegetable aromas and flavors that warm up a little in the glass to turn into sweet cherries.
Slightly darker than most basic Campo de Borja Tempranillos, with earthy aromas along with black fruit notes. The palate is full and rugged, with scratchiness but also fresh, forward flavors of black fruits including plum and boysenberry. A good wine with guts.
Spicy black fruit, with bell pepper, black pepper and toast adding complexity. Partial whole-berry fermentation brings an element of spicy, forward fruitiness to the wine. Lively mouthfeel, with some heat and lift to the finish. If there were more depth and punch to the fruit, this would warrant an even higher rating.
This wine features a fresh nose of grapefruit and lemon peel. It is bright on the palate, offering flavors of grapefruit, pear and green apple. It remains crisp and clean across the entire tongue right into the orange zest finish.
Red fruit dominates this attractive, light wine that shows the acidity of the year while also suggesting light tannins. The aftertaste has a touch of smokiness. It will develop quickly.
The grapes got a little too ripe, getting away from the winemaker's control. There's lots of deliciousness, but that supermature edge of raisins, excessive softness and touch of Port make the wine unbalanced, despite the excellence of its vineyard sources.
Shows the exotic, peppery spiciness and wild, brambly quality you want in a nice Zin, and the wine is dry and clean. But it's a little too thin in fruit, with just a suggestion of blackberries and currants.
This is a soft and creamy wine, ripe with baked apple and crisp pear flavors. Balanced and full in the mouth, it attractive and ready to drink.
Initially this smells closed, charred, oaky and minty more than lush and fruity, but with airing things get reversed. The palate is rich, ripped and juicy, with excellent structure. Flavors of blackberry, cassis, spice and reedy tobacco finish dry, powerful and with a strong note of licorice. Drink through 2020.
Here's a blend of 85% Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon that offers succulent plum, black currant and prune flavors layered with notes of oak, spice and cocoa. While rich fruit and smooth tannins make this appealing now, fresh acidity gives this some staying power. Drink through 2020.
Floral, exotic blueberry aromas come with baking-spice notes. A palate lifted by integrated acidity offers layered blueberry, cardamom and chocolate flavors. The full spicy blue-fruit finish is warm and lasting. If you know Achaval-Ferrer's wines, this will be familiar and fitting.
This is the inaugural release for Browne Family Chardonnay. Crisp and leesy, it has a smooth, creamy midpalate, with a buttered toast highlight. Refreshing acidity and excellent length keep it fresh and lively.
This wine starts out quite reductive which provides distraction. Aromas of flowers and ripe pear lead to broad flavors that seem to fall a bit flat.
Standard Cab characteristics of black currant, plum skins, blackberry and cherry lifted by accents of licorice and spice. Supple weight and gripping tannins with a solid, medium-length finish. A straightforward wine that will pair well with red meat.
Very sweet, with honey, caramel, chocolate and vanilla truffle and butterscotch flavors, but sweetness isn't everything. Despite some cherry and blackberry flavors, the wine is thin in fruity depth.
This 100% Cabernet is so approachable now. The palate offers waves of ripe blackberries, cherries, cassis and mocha, touched with oak and wrapped in firm tannins. The grapes were grown in the new Coombsville appellation of the valley.
This is 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, grown in the winery's estate vineyard, on the east side of Napa Valley. It's awesomely rich and ripe, delivering heady blackberry, blueberry, cassis liqueur, cola and new oak flavors that are as long in the finish as they are deep. With thick tannins, it's clearly a wine you need to cellar. Drink 2016–2020 and beyond.
Forced oak and baked apple aromas work the nose on this challenged, wheaty Chardonnay. Voluminous in the mouth but cloying, with banana, toffee and pudding-like flavors. Heavy and oaky on the finish, which is all about butterscotch and resin covering up marginal fruit character.
Delicate crisp yellow apple and tangerine flavors are laced with dusty pollen and crushed mineral tones in this dry white. While medium bodied, it's pleasantly creamy in texture, brightened by a streak of lemony acidity on the finish.
Rich and savory, this has bold fruit notes of cherry and blackberry followed by delicate nuances of licorice, tar, spice and leather. Thanks to its structure and density, it's a wine you can really sink your teeth into.
Soft and gentle, with the mashed cherry flavors Grenache is noted for, this wine has spicy nuances of cloves, anise, cinnamon and vanilla. It's a little sweet.
Coarse raspberry and plum aromas are backed by a narrow palate with limited flavors of cherry chewing gum and cough drop. This stays consistent by finishing with a wiry, raw feel.
Leather, dried cherries, plums, dark chocolate and sagebrush aromas are woven into a decent if not entirely lively nose. Lots of chopped fresh and dried herbs arise once sipped, along with gravel, black fruit and sticky tannins.
From entirely estate-grown fruit and blended with 5% Cabernet Franc, this is a soft, full and well-structured wine, sanguine in currant, cassis and a dusting of brambly raspberry. Inviting, it finishes in a pleasing note of mocha.
It's tempting to call this Burgundian, but it's truly Oregonian—a lush, expressive mix of tart tree fruits, vivid acidity, lightly applied barrel toast, and smidges of coconut and vanilla. It was whole-cluster pressed, and fermented half in stainless, half in 30% new French oak.
Perfumed, floral and ageworthy, this combines a taut texture with a toast note, showing great depth of flavor. The line of pure green and white fruit is very apparent. On the finish, bright acidity matches the great fruitiness.
Among all eight of the winery's current Rieslings, this was the least accessible upon opening. With ample breathing time it began to show more aromatics, with flavors of orange and pear in a nicely concentrated, well-balanced package. This is the one to decant!
This is as good as Sauvignon Blanc gets in Washington—a dense, pungent, intensely aromatic and gloriously flavorful wine sourced entirely from the Klipsun Vineyard.

This is one of those bottles that empties much faster than you'd like.
Complex leesy, smoky, nutty aromas adorn the nose of this racy wine. It displays a citrusy tartness and lime, green apple, vanilla and wintergreen accents that linger refreshingly. Finishes with unusual apple, nut and burnt sugar aromas and flavors. A Mendocino appellation wine from Jim Clendenon, the notorious ‘Mind Behind' Santa Barbara County's Au Bon Climat Winery.
Aged only in stainless steel to preserve its fresh, clean flavors, this expression of Favorita (a little-known white wine grape from northern Italy) offers lively tones of lemon zest, white blossom and cut grass.
This is on the ripe side of the Sauvignon spectrum, with scents of honey and marmalade on the nose and flavors of ripe citrus, touches of stone fruit and hints of currant on the palate. It's simply fruit-driven, but satisfying nonetheless. Drink now.
Shows ample complexity on the nose, offering up hints of dried apricot and crushed stone to go alongside dominant notes of superripe apple. On the palate, although this lacks the zest and freshness of the very best auslese, it's still a leasing package, combining hints of honeyed richness with ripe pears and spice. Drink over the next 5–10 years.
Overly sweet and simple, and something of a disappointment given the winery's past performance, this Syrah tastes like melted cherry jam, stirred with chocolate pie filling and sprinkled with fennel and pepper.
A consistent wine from year to year that's made in a friendly, mass-appeal style. It's not so pungent and citrusy like some Verdejo; instead it's more peachy, sweet and melony. Soft on the finish but with just enough acidity to get it through the year.
From a certified organic producer, this bright wine opens with a pretty garnet color and aromas of forest berry, bramble, white almond and cassis. There's a touch of softness in the mouth, followed by a bitter almond finish.
Spicy, dry and leafy aromas control the lightweight bouquet. The palate on this wine feels dry and raw, while a buttery oak note supports the herbal, spicy and brambly flavors and the fiery, short finish.

Aged only in stainless steel, this expression of Vermentino offers fragrant aromas that span from natural rubber to apricot. The wine is creamy and smooth on the finish, with a touch of spice.
Aromas of baked earth, black plum and cocoa lift out of the glass. Round and juicy, the palate delivers mature blackberry, licorice and tobacco alongside velvety tannins. Enjoy through 2020.
Held back for nearly four years, the tannins in this bottling have begun to resolve, but it's still a tight, immature wine that needs lots of time. Enormously rich and concentrated with mountain blackberries, dark chocolate and minerals, its balance puts it right up there among the Napa players. Give it 6–8 years to show what it can do.
This elegantly packaged Insolia has a pretty, luminous appearance and pristine notes of stone fruit, citrus and mineral. This is your quintessential seafood wine: grilled sea bass, poached salmon or steamed mussels would all taste great in this wine's company.
A shock of white pepper remains memorable throughout this wine, which hails from a high-elevation vineyard overlooking the Pacific Ocean. Pinot Noir-like in its leanness and silky mouthfeel, it's prickly with feral jolts of cinnamon and tobacco.
Rich and penetrating, this shows tertiary aromas of crushed stone, cured leather and black truffle. The mouthfeel is polished and smooth.
A delightful wine, clean and versatile at the table, that's a cross between a rich Chardonnay and a zesty Pinot Gris. Bone dry, it displays crisp flavors of Meyer lemons, limes, tangerines and pears, enriched with a touch of buttercream and vanilla.
This is an everyday Cabernet, dry, tannic and somewhat green, with tobacco and cherry flavors. It lacks generosity, which no amount of decanting or aging will help.
Reuilly has the peculiarity of having rosés from Pinot Gris, even though its reds are from Pinot Noir. This perfumed wine with its pale color brings out the slightly dusty character of the grape. That's contrasted with the intense acidity and black currant fruit flavors. Drink now.
This feels slightly softer in the mouth than the massive 2006, but carries the density and gravitas that one associates with Quilceda Creek. Wonderful balance, with a deeply detailed set of flavors that gather strength as they move through the palate. Mixed berries, threaded with chocolate, lingering with black cherry, cassis, smoke, cedar, lead pencil and more.
Thin and sharp as broken glass, with an herbal, sour flavor profile and a tart, sheering mouthfeel and finish. Compared to previous vintages when this wine impressed, this is a loser. Barely drinkable, it's so lean and sour.
Cabernet Sauvignon makes up half of this wine, with the balance Merlot (31%), Malbec (15%) and Cabernet Franc. Barrel notes of vanilla and baking spice are up front, followed by herb and dark fruit tones that are backed by lively acidity. It currently drinks very tight. Give it some time in the cellar or an extended decant. Best after 2020.
Green herb, barrel spice, clove and cherry aromas intermingle and lead to a highly structured palate, with supple fruit flavors. It might be a touch green for some tastes.

A lovely blend of 60% Malbec, 31% Cabernet Sauvignon, 6% Petit Verdot and 3% Tannat, this is strong, with aromas of coconut, cola, chocolate and pure berry. It's a powerful wine, with a flavorful core of black fruit accented by coffee and burnt toast. Drink now–2018.
Kaiken Ultra has emerged as a consistent top-shelf Malbec. This vintage shows power, purity, mineral, ripe fruit and well-applied oak. It's a generous wine with kirsch and raspberry parfait flavors. It almost makes it to creamy but by holding onto its core acidity it guards overall balance. Unforced but a little forceful; good for those who like a ripe, meaty red wine.
Pale, light-bodied, fruity and dry, this is the un-Cabernet, the red for white wine lovers. So easy to enjoy, you might overlook its complexities. Red cherries, cola, pomegranate, rosehip tea, cinnamon and ginger candy, it's really delicious. Drink now for its freshness.
Strong aromatics introduce an oily-textured wine, very typical of this grape. The flavors are of bergamot, superripe lychee and sweet spice. This is definitely exotic.

Dark concentration and medium aromatic intensity open Barolo Castelletto. There's a delicate, feminine side to this Nebbiolo that presents itself through aromas of pressed violet, root beer, chopped mint and peppermint. Those fresh overtones are backed by tight, gripping tannins. Drink after 2018.
This Barolo from the Gattera vineyard of La Morra opens with bold personality and chiseled aromas of cola, spice, black fruit, root beer, licorice, dried tobacco and herbs. The wine holds the banner high as far as Nebbiolo tradition goes and offers a long, spice- filled finish. Drink after 2015.

Made from 100% estate grapes, this wine is shy in aroma but happily light and bright on the palate. It's delicate yet framed by firm tannins, showing blueberry and toasty oak flavors and nuanced acidity.
This is a wine that would benefit from further bottle aging: Just a little earth and anise come through on the nose. It's tightly wound all around—a little lean, even—but pleasantly so, its juicy, tangy black cherry flavors and lively acidity dominating at this stage. Supple and layered on the palate and through the finish. Drink 2008–2012.
Pale lemon in color. Restrained at first and quite reduced, but opens up in the glass to show appealing citrus and white peach aromas. Crisp and juicy, with citrus flavors predominating—tangerine, ruby red grapefruit and meyer lemon. Medium sweet, refreshing but slightly short on the finish.
Skylite's Cabernet captures a pleasing sweetness around the flavors of boysenberry and pie cherry. There is also an interesting streak of hay or grain that stretches into a well-defined finish. It's a nicely balanced wine that doesn't overreach; the barrel flavors mix in well with the crisp, clean fruit.
This off-dry blend is nicely crafted and seamless, with abundant fruit and floral notes. It's off-dry, not sugary, and fresh enough with natural acidity to stand well with most seafood.
Dried herbs, grass and hay with some pear, apple skin and crushed stone sums up the nose. The mouth delivers less excitement; a sour note interrupts what would otherwise be a smoother ride. Imported by Laird & Company.
Functional Rioja Reserva is what this is. The nose starts out smoky and powerful, but the fruit is lean and on the snappy and tart side, with orange peel and cherry skins getting into the game. For a stellar year like 2001, it's surprisingly lean and basic.
This is another outstanding vintage for Seven Hills Malbec, clearly one of the best in the Northwest. Dark, concentrated and impeccably focused, this mixes raspberry and cherry fruits with threads of smoke, espresso and dark, roasted wood. The tannins are gorgeous—smooth, powerful and stylish to the point of silkiness. Licorice and dark chocolate put the bow on the finish.

Structured and soft, this wine is also delightfully juicy, bright and succulent in red berry with a side of crumble, topped in milk chocolate and brown sugar. Full bodied, it remains balanced on the palate.
Earthy rose, plum and rhubarb mark the entry of this soft, seamlessly textured reserve wine. Medium-bodied, it skews toward savory characteristics, most notably black tea.
A weird wine in every way. The nose smells like something off the grid, with briney fruit, funky spice notes and compost. Creamy and oaky in the mouth, with herbal flavors and a dash of nutmeg and/or cardamom. Hard on the finish, and just too strange to bother with.
The nose on this widely available bottling is vivacious and juicy, with strawberry, strawberry blossoms and raspberries laid across a pencil-lead frame. It tightens on the palate, with lots of graphite and pencil shavings, showing just a bit of pomegranate fruit.
A rugged, tart everyday red blend. Shows berry-cherry flavors, with some green tannins and sharp acidity.

The vineyard has been a Zinfandel source to St. Francis, as well as other wineries, for years, but this is St. Francis's best in a decade. The wine is fantastically concentrated in dried blackberry, blueberry, dark unsweetened chocolate, tobacco and elaborate spice flavors. Defines complexity in Zinfandel, although the very high alcohol will bother some people.
All spice, juicy fruit and dry tannins, this certainly evokes the spirit of the grape. There is a mineral quality to the red berry fruits, which comes through in the youthful, firm edge. Give this wine another two years so the  fruit will open up.
This blend of Sangiovese and Sagrantino is aged in tonneaux and offers aromas of black berry, cherry and oak. The palate has a vibrant black-cherry core accented by pepper, cinnamon and espresso notes, as well as bracing yet ripe tannins.
With its 5 million bottle production, this is one of Portugal's leading brands. It is a ripe wine, but with a stalky element, giving freshness, although the aftertaste is soft, perhaps sweet, very easy, ripe.
Peter Zemmer produces an enjoyable and pristine expression of Pinot Grigio that really hones in on the freshness and simplicity of the grape. The finish is marked by tones of citrus, pear and white peach.
Aromas of wood smoke and grilled meat set up bold smoky, peppery flavors in this complex, spicy and full-bodied wine. The savory beefy aspects are a pleasure to taste and there is a good foundation of mild tannins and solid cherry flavors.
Fresh and floral on the nose, this is a clean, zesty example of kabinett, the type that was difficult to craft in 2006. Citrus and green apple flavors are true to type, with hints of fresh greens and spring flowers adding a bit of complexity.
Huge and on the border of overwhelming. But if you like yours concentrated and forward (although arguably not that complex) then Pingus is a dream come true. Start with the bouquet of coffee, earth, black truffle and smoked meat before digging into the wine's saturated black-fruit palate. Big tannins on the finish say lay it down for several years.
Priced affordably for the appellation, this is a somewhat balanced Cab suggestive of bell pepper and jalapeño that dance around in smoke, currant and cedar. It finishes dry and tannic in vanilla oak.
Simple, light strawberry aromas form a good opening. The palate is juicy and bright, with citrus and nectarine flavors. There's nothing complicated or overreaching here; it's easygoing, clean and finishes with pepper and brown sugar.
Stevenot has a good record at producing this stainless-steel-fermented wine. It's a savory, complex white, with high acidity framing honeyed flavors of Meyer lemons, limes, papayas, pine tar, slate and vanilla, with a hint of petrol. That sweet-tart tension makes the wine the perfect foil for Asian fusion fare.
Here's the quintessential Soave Classico that veers on the side of informality and easy-drinking appeal. The wine is redolent of white peach, citrus and Golden Delicious apple.
A full-bodied but not over-the-top Zin that is deliciously fruity, tasting like raspberry jam and fresh blueberries. No overt oak flavors mask the pure enjoyment of well-ripened and carefully fermented grapes. It's extremely smooth, ever so slightly sweet and has a rich, lingering finish.
This is an impressive, big, burly wine. Sweet with a rich fee; flavors of ripe lychee and pear flavors are laced with spice. Powerful and weighty, drink this by itself as a wine for contemplation.
Very smooth and quietly flavorful, this wine has more almond and vanilla notes than overt fruitiness, making it a subtle treat. It's full-bodied and soft on the palate, with good concentration.
Another knockout of this vintage from this site, a portion within the larger estate Quail Hill Vineyard, Summit is perfumed and pretty, full bodied without ever seeming heavy. Crisp punches of strawberry, cherry and a streak of lemon tartness please the palate in an endless loop of complex, velvety texture.
Aromas of bright berry, tobacco and a balsamic note come together in the glass. The palate offers raw red berry, black cherry, white pepper and anise alongside sleek tannins and bright acidity. Give this time to unwind and fully develop. Drink after 2018.
Jarvis has assembled a great record with this bottling over the years. The 2012 fulfills all the basic California requirements for impressive Chardonnay, with ripe, flamboyant tropical fruit, pear and pineapple flavors, along with lots of sweet, buttery, vanilla-accented oak. This is one of the most decadent Chardonnays of the vintage, and while it's a little soft, it is flashy.
We loved the menthol freshness of this wine with mineral notes, eucalyptus, candied cherry, tealeaf or moist tobacco and leather. Warm, inviting and lush and tightly packed by rock-hard tannins. A very persistent finish. Imported by Masciarelli Wine Co.
The nose on this feather-light wine is enticingly perfumed, wafting of pristine white blossoms and peach. The palate, while a touch sweet, shows more earth and mineral than fruit, finishing on a slightly dark, brambly tone.
Light in color and soft in texture, this fruity wine attains an attractive balance between crushed ripe strawberries and fresh acidity. Vibrant yet with ample weight, it is drinkable now.
A very nice wine that shows the smooth, complex tannin structure, ripe fruit and dry balance you'd want from a Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon. You'll like the blackberry, cherry and cedar flavors, enhanced by touches of dried herb and cocoa. Drink now–2015 for fruity freshness.
There's a gorgeous floral lift to this silky-smooth wine. Red cherry and raspberry flavors are penetrating and ripe, but brisk with an invigorating mineral touch. Finely grained tannins linger on the finish.
At nearly 16% alcohol, this is one of the biggest Chards I've ever had. It's totally dry and explosive in all sorts of late-picked, effusively ripe pineapple custard, lemon drop and apricot, caramelized brown sugar and cinnamon. A wine like this is an achievement anywhere, and while there are those who will object to its size, it is certainly delicious.
This dark, very ripe Crianza smells extracted, jammy and slightly soupy, with aromas of raisin, pipe tobacco and blackberry. The palate is heavy and a touch hollow, with baked berry, vanilla, licorice and resiny flavors. An oak-based finish tastes ripe, succulent and like mocha.
Aromatic stone fruit swings in those lively citrus notes. There is a creamy apple flavor in the background, softening the bold lemon notes. This is pure and lifted, graceful and slender.
This is a simply, citrusy Sauvignon Blanc that finishes clean and refreshing. It's medium in weight, with bold, food-friendly flavors of white grapefruit.
A full, liquorous wine, with ripe mango and apricot flavors set against a backdrop of honey, dry botrytis and dense texture. The wine is now ready and maturing well. Drink over the next year.
Rich and rounded in character, this is already a beautiful wine, from 80-year-old vines. A line of acidity shoots through the wine, giving a long lift to the green fruits and orange zest flavors. It does have weight and a generous texture that reveals itself slowly. Ripe apricots mingle with acidity and toast at the end. Drink from 2019.
Opens with sensational aromas that span plum, berry and chocolate. Feels compact yet juicy, with a lot of depth and purity. Wild berry, mint and bacon-like flavors work the palate, while the finish is defined by tannins, woody spice and natural body. A smooth bruiser to enjoy with venison or steak.
There's a smoky aroma that's almost cigarette ashy, and a distractingly sweet sugary finish to the cherry and cola flavors of this Pinot Noir. Could be going through a dumb phase. Try after 2009.
Freshly cut pear, ivy leaf and spice mark the nose of this wine. The palate is slender but juicy, full of citrus-fresh fruit. It's all about joy and drinkability, feeling more structured and serious on the clean finish.
A kitchen sink blend of red grape varieties from Cinsault to Tempranillo, this quirky Lebanese red is soft and pulpy with overripe fruit, mocha chocolate and a whiff of barnyard on the nose and palate.
Aromas of asphalt, milk chocolate and generic berry fruits come with notes of creosote and chimney. This feels tannic and a bit flat. Savory, rubbery berry flavors are roasted and taste like oak-based clove on the finish.
This wine needs some time to open up in the glass, but once it finally does you'll be greeted with an attractive bouquet loaded with savory herbs, leather, dark chocolate, espresso grinds and black cherry and berry fruit aromas. Dusty tannins and medium acidity frame the solid structure and linger through the long finish. Drink now-2014.
This wine is stunningly savory on the nose, with blackberry and blueberry fruit seasoned by melted chocolate mint, lush lilacs and a hint of caramel. The palate proves more tart than expected, but lively with licorice, dark coffee, boysenberry reduction and elderberry flavors.
The problem here is excessive sweetness. It tastes like there was a lot of residual sugar in the wine when fermentation was stopped. As a result the flavor is of sugared blackberry tea.
A crisp bouquet of orange zest marks the opening of this wine, an unexpected twist to the narrative of dried cranberry, blackberry and cloves. On the palate, this full-bodied wine offers ample weight and richness, before a wealth of dry tannins feature on the finish.
Shows the sweet fruitiness and bite of citrusy acidity of raspberry and cherry jam, a simple Cabernet to drink now.
This rusty-colored Merlot opens with roasted, herbal, burnt aromas of plum and currant. Light, fresh and saucy on the palate, this tastes of tomato sauce, pepper and barely ripe plum. Herbal, savory and green on the finish.
This is spicy, woody and sharp, with good red fruits. However, there is a strong streak of bitter green vegetal flavors running through the tannins. The bitterness may subside with more cellar time, but at the moment it does kill a lot of the fruit sweetness.
This has the assertive vanilla and tobacco flavors that often come with certain oak treatments; these are friendly, familiar components of many inexpensive California bottlings. The difference here is that there is real, substantial fruit at the heart of the wine—it's bursting with berries and cherries.
Round and fruity, with a generous mix of berry and cherry, and no discernible oak influence, this pleasing Mourvèdre lets the fruit be the star. Nicely balanced and drinking well already, it carries a hint of mineral/metal in the finish.
This pale rosé, made from Cabernet Franc and Chenin Blanc, is attractively fresh, with balanced acidity and fruitiness. The wine offers a tang of plum skins as well as a bite of raspberry. Drink now.
This smooth wine is from a small parcel in the producer's domaine. It has wood and spice as well as acidity and a touch of minerality. It will need some time, so drink from 2019.
This wine opens with aromas of ultraripe grapes, despite the relatively moderate listed alcohol. Baking spices, Christmas cake, plum pastry and almost Port-like flavors (without the alcoholic heat) suggest that very ripe grapes were included in the the mix of fruit. Drink up.
A top wine in the Deutz range, packed with maturing richness, balancing fresh grapefruits against toasted almonds, an elegant structure, and an impressive power of flavor, leaving a dense mouthful of wine that manages to float at the same time.
A vineyard-designated Brunello with sharp clarity and purity. Sangiovese aromas of wild berry, earth, pressed blue flower and forest floor. Lively and direct on the palate, with integrated acidity and firm structure.
A mix of raisiny aromas and grass notes gives this wine a green sort of bouquet. The palate is chunky, with thick berry and plum flavors that are good if not put under the microscope. More voluminous than precise, with big tannins and a “country” sort of personality, meaning it's fruity and big but not that refined.
With its strong initial impression of dryness, this is obviously a structured wine. It is dense, rich and concentrated with fine tannins, spice and a strong orange-zest character. Refreshing acidity gives a lift to this ripe, full wine. Drink from 2019.
There's a floral scent underlying the light red fruits, and a hint of that same soapy character in the mouth. It's set against loam and mocha flavors, with fairly high (15.2%) alcohol and slightly bitter tannins.
A medium dry wine with hints of honey over dried apricot and lemon crispness. Intense acidity gives the wine great lift and crispness. It is still young and will be better from 2017.
Here's a quasi-aromatic Prosecco Brut with floral aromas and loads of pear and Golden Delicious apple. The wine is full, generous and has creamy froth in the mouth that is backed by perky effervescence. Pair it with pastry-based finger foods.
This opens with aromas of coconut, roasted coffee bean and steeped plum. The dense, extracted palate offers oak extract, blueberry syrup, espresso and a confectionary note.
There is a touch of wood here, partnering with the wine's weight, minerality and crisp character. White fruit flavors of apple and pear lend further brightness.
One in a series of field-blend wines from the producer, this comes from a 100-year old parcel within the Gaivosa estate. Packed with both tannins and rich, jammy fruit, it's a serious wine that deserves aging. Drink from 2020.
There's never more than a barrel of this outstanding wine to go around, but it's well worth hunting down. Powerful and lush, it's got a silky, voluptuously fruity mouthfeel. Candied citrus and apple pie come to mind, as the flavors continue rushing through, finishing with a spicy lift and a whiff of menthol.
A very young wine, with great ripe red fruit flavors, from this single parcel wine. At this stage, when it is all fruit, the tannins, the acidity and the wood flavors are submerged. But it's going to be a fine, serious, long-lived wine.
Fresh and blossomy, this elegant medium-bodied rosé offers loads of raspberry fruitiness, but also a deeply mineral spine of chalk and sea breeze. Made predominantly from Merlot and Cabernet Franc, it holds smaller proportions of Pinot Noir, Pinot Meunier and Chardonnay that lend complexity and nuance.
This blend of 43% Merlot, 26% Petit Verdot, 22% Carmenère, 5% Cabernet Sauvignon and 4% Syrah offers orange peel, herb, raspberry and spice aromas that don't seem entirely knit together. Dry tannins back up its blue and black fruit flavors.
A rich, savory Pinot Gris that's just a little sweet, and has a slight fizziness that makes it lively. Rich in citrus, tropical fruit, honeysuckle and vanilla flavors, brightened with brilliant acidity, it shows a buttery smokiness from neutral oak. Drink this refreshing wine now.
An herbaceous, catty wine, packed with gooseberry and grapefruit flavors. It is all crisp, fresh fruit and tight texture. It needs a few months to lose its shocking acidity.
Dried herb, dust and compost provide a dark underbelly in this vineyard-designated varietal wine. It's layered with caramel and toffee notes that are complemented by bright acidity and further freshened by sparks of pomegranate and cassis.
A terrific effort from two Barossa vineyards, one in Greenock and the other in Vinevale, this is wonderfully perfumed and floral on the nose, yet also peppery and fruity—in a word, complex. Ditto the flavors, which range from coffee to olive, chocolate to vanilla and berries to spice. All of these elements are tied together by a creamy, lush texture and a long, elegant and refined finish. Drink now–2020.
Standard Pinot aromas of cherry and earthy spice are basic but sound. This feels snappy, tight and edgy, with plum and currant flavors. A mild but lasting finish shows a touch of hickory and smoke.
Chardonnay doesn't get much richer or riper than this. Explodes with grilled pineapple, lemondrop, smoky meringue, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors, brightened and boosted by crisp, citrusy cool-climate acidity. Racy and clean and complex, it should develop bottle nuance over the next four years.
Beeswax, lemon-laced sour cream and a peach-blossom ripeness combine on the nose of this excellently restrained wine from a highly variable, often overripe grape. There is great energy and balance on the palate, with a light nuttiness and a touch of honey that will drink well for a few years.
Nothing if not stout and fruity. This is a big, modern Syrah with a mountain's worth of plum, berry and currant character on the nose, palate and finish. The acidity is a bit jagged and amplified, which creates some crispness, tension and pop. But overall it's a burly specimen that despite 20 months in oak does not taste woody. Drink or hold until 2012. Imported by Kobrand.
This Syrah is marked by rich, extracted flavors. It's strong in blackberries, cherries and raspberries, coated with lots of smoky, caramelized oak. The deliciousness factor is very high. Drink now for decadent youthfulness.
Very fine and rich, especially the texture, which is as velvety smooth as Napa Cab gets. The tannins are a wonder, perfectly ripe and soft, which gives the wine a feminine mouthfeel. But the oak and fruit are pure power. This is supple and rich, but somehow, it doesn't seem like an ager. Drink now through 2009.
The nose of this wine is somewhat reduced, signalling that it needs to breathe. The palate is zesty and comes with a wonderfully grippy but taut phenolic texture, lending structure to its slim body of green and yellow apple fruit with riper notions of yellow plum and peach. The finish is clean, dry and refreshing.
89-91 Barrel sample. Black colored wine. The harvest here finished in November, and the extra richness shows in the smooth, extracted caramel structure. But the delicious plum juice flavors are seductive.
Tough tannins give this wine a kick. It's like rubbing sandpaper on the tongue, but there's a brilliantly ripe core of blackberries, cherries and blackberry liqueur. Oak adds richer levels of caramel and vanilla. Not clear if it will age well, so drink soon after a few hours decanting.
93-95 Barrel sample. A hard, powerfully dry wine that packs big tannins over the fruit. The wood element is certainly there, but it's the almost Napa-like fruit tannins that drive this wine.
Here's a poised, refreshing white that opens with enticing aromas of spring blossom and stone fruit. The luminous palate offers fresh peach, Granny Smith apple and nectarine alongside crisp acidity. A hint of Alpine herb enhances the clean finish.
Mantele is a bright and luminous Sauvignon with immediate aromas of mango, kiwi and pineapple. The winemaking approach here puts an emphasis on purity, elegance and straightforwardness.
This is dry Beaujolais, boasting as much structure as fruit. The tannins are prominent, underpinning the spicy black berry fruits. The effect is rich, a wine that will age well over 2–3 years.
This winery expertly differentiates its single-vineyard bottlings, here exploring the warmer, riper side of the grape, but with style and grace. Aromas of vanilla, sea-salt caramel, macadamia nut and hazelnut lead into a palate where lightly buttered yellow apples meet with jasmine tea, honeysuckle and a light touch of marzipan.
Murky, stewy, soupy aromas deliver little to no freshness or fruit, while the palate is tannic and tastes bitter, mildly weedy and minty. Seems roasted and devoid of quality. Unclean and unimpressive.
Cherry aromas cross over into cough drop country, while the palate is a mix of plum and berry flavors with pepper. The feel is tight, but there isn't much variety of depth. Not a bad wine, but it doesn't develop much momentum.
Traditional Chianti, with no small oak aging and no Cabernet or Merlot. Leathery, with dried cherry aromas and a hint of tobacco on the nose, then shows bright, focused fruit flavors on the palate. Finishes with bass notes of dark chocolate and earth.
Punchy raspberry and plum aromas indicate that this Garnacha Tintorera (Alicante Bouschet) is no weakling. An edgy, slightly grating palate offers plum and medicinal flavors along with bright acidity. Mild resin and oak-spice flavors are detectable on the finish.
Apple aromas are mild and innocuous. This feels wide, chunky and without definition. Flavors of pithy white fruits turn bitter and briny on the finish.
This unusual Cabernet, which includes small percentages of four different Rhône red grapes, doesn't show much of anything in the way of Cabernet flavor. Stemmy and tannic, with green tea on the finish, it registers high in alcohol but is green on the palate.
An aromatic twist of passion fruit plays on the nose of this dry wine. The slender palate leads with tangerine, lemon and grapefruit peel flavors, oozing verve and focused, zesty citrus notes. It has loads of vigor and provides ideal refreshment.
Roasted and earthy smelling, with a pinch of iodine and even a whiff of bacon or ham. Rich, full and a touch sticky on the tongue, with baked berry and chocolate flavors. Mellow and sweet on the back end. 100% Malbec.
This winery has made a nice Sauvignon Blanc as far back as I can remember. The 2016 is a linear, precise example, tightly focused and crisp on the finish. The ample pineapple and grapefruit aromas and flavors are zesty and refreshing.
Superripe fruit gives the wine weight and richness, toast and peach and pineapple fruits. Old vines give the concentration and opulent fruit. Worth aging 2–3 years.
This is a luscious and delicious Sauvignon with pungent tones of passion fruit, fresh mango, exotic fruit, sage, tomato leaf and lingering lime. It is exceptionally vibrant and tasty in the mouth with bright fruit flavors, crisp acidity and long persistency. It's a fun, cheerful wine and would be an ideal apéritif on a hot weekend afternoon.
Aromas of clover blossom, stony minerals and apple are inviting and clean. This is fairly full in body, with pulpy weight as well as citrusy acidity. Pithy flavors of orange and citrus rind turn slightly bitter on the finish. Drink now.
Violet red to the eye, this wine is a blend of 55% Syrah, 35% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Merlot. A nose of black cherry and violet prepares the palate for flavors of cassis, cherry conserves, orange zest, licorice and tobacco. Fruit and spice flavors keep each other in check amid velvety tannins. The smooth cherry finish is highlighted by touches of orange zest.
A great Pinot Grigio, the kind that restaurateurs should scoop up for their by-the-glass program. Dryish and refreshingly tart, it offers flavors of pineapples, pears, honeysuckle, vanilla and pepper spice. Easy to find, with 15,000 cases produced.
A blend of the local Niellucciu and Sciaccarello grapes, this is a robust wine, with rustic tannins, blackberry acidity and a firm dry core. A great barbecue wine, finishing very fresh with a layer of wood.
This stunning TBA is a powerhouse of superripe peach, mango and orange flavors. The palate feels smooth and rich, with honey and marmalade flavors, but it's ethereally light, with a dusty minerality and shrieking lemon acidity that reverberates on the finish. Gorgeous now, but should develop an earthy, honeyed intensity over the next decade.
This has been an interesting wine from Niner. Last year's bottling was terrific. So's this 2006. At the ripe old age of five, it's still firm in tannins and even has a cut of acidity that gives the blackberry and blueberry fruit a bite. Tastes fresh and lively, and could improve with 5–6 years in the bottle.
Simple pineapple, mango and peach aromas lead to a plain palate of orange peel and lime. The finish is similar, as this wine fits the description of easygoing. Beware: it is softening as we speak, so drink immediately.
Ripe and showing the typical generosity of this château, this bold, round wine is powered by rich berry and damson fruit flavors. It is juicy and perfumed, while the tannic structure and wood flavors are enveloped by the fruits. Drink from 2020.
A blend of Nero d'Avola and Nerello Cappuccio, this delivers a tangy, spicy feel, plus polished aromas of blackberry, almond and cured meat. Pair this easygoing selection with pepperoni pizza.
A blend of 60% Mavrud and 40% Rubin, this ruby-colored wine has aromas of black berry, black plum and a touch of powdered cocoa. In the mouth, flavors recall black cherry, black raspberry and a hint of mocha and espresso. Tannins are soft and the finish is persistent.
Bitter cherries and dark, tarry flavors mark this wood-aged Pinot Noir. There is a strong new wood character that gives some bitterness. The wine needs another year to soften.
Meaty and also jammy, with popcorn and cedar aromas. Dry and complex, typical of the winery's style, and mildly astringent. The tannins are starching at this point, but should fade. Given time, the red fruit should emerge and conquer the youthful astringency.
Cherry and plum aromas are basic and candied, while the palate on this Prieto Picudo-based wine is perky and acidic. The flavors run dilute and herbal, with cherry pie and tart raspberry notes. Lingering acidity makes the finish both fresh and sharp.
Rachis refers to a particular part of the grape stem, and indicates that roughly one quarter of this wine is whole cluster fermented. Very pretty cherry fruit is gently mixed with accents of Italian herbs, and the stems tighten up the tannins and add a light hint of bitterness. The finish has a tart, grapefruity kick.
This tastes like fruit from a cooler, perhaps higher altitude site. It's got a bracing minerality that runs through the fruit and gives the wine a solid backbone. Rhubarb and cranberry fruit is tightly laced against that rocky core, with plenty of natural acid propping up the finish. Little oak flavor is evident right now, though 38% of the barrels were new. This wine should be decanted, but as it opens it really shines.
Fogarty continues its streak of great, Chablis-style Chardonnays with this single-vineyard bottling. True afficionados will love the dryness, acidity and minerality, which give it such great structure. The severity is relieved by flavors of citrus zest and white peach, and the creamy sourdough richness imparted by lees aging. Try aging it for at least six years.
88-90. Barrel sample. Filled with new wood, spice and toast, this wine is open and rich, moving more to fruit than tannin.
Oak dominates this wine, towering over everything else and offering a strong dose of caramel, hardened by wood tannins. There are some good cherry and red currant flavors, but they're swamped by the barrel regimen. Disappointing for this fine Carneros vineyard.
Sweet and intoxicating, with caramel, baked fruit and cotton candy to the nose. Meaty on the palate, with full plum, boysenberry and cherry flavors. Best of all, the balance is just where it should be. As a whole there's nothing not to like about it.
Earthy, rubbery blackberry aromas become more clean and open the longer this sits. Firm tannins create a strong but fair palate, while licorice, mint and spice notes sit on top of generic berry flavors. Weight and heat are noticeable on the finish.
A few words that describe this wine are lusty, brawny, rustic, really ripe, jammy, peppery, smooth and spicy. In other words, classic Foothills Zin. But just as important is what it's not. It's not high in alcohol, nor is it sweet. Drink this balanced Zin with barbecued ribs.
Tough in tannins and acidic in the Mayacamas style. Feels hard and dry and earthy. The cherry-berry flavors have a tomatoey edge. But this Merlot, which contains 17% Cabernet Sauvignon, has a classy elegance, and opens up as it breathes in the glass.
This is a genuine and extremely clean expression of Barbera with a compact but pristine bouquet of wild berries, porcino mushroom, bitter almond and fresh tobacco. The wine is polished and compact in the mouth with crisp acidity on the close.
A bit too ripe, to judge from the stewed berry and raisin flavors, but other than that, the wine is fully dry,  with rich, complex tannins. Drink with roasted meats and hard cheeses.
A black wine with aromas of graphite, molten earth and black fruit. The palate is a pounder with strong tannins and blazing acidity, and that creates a mouthfeel with grating intensity and roasted black fruit flavors. Lively late, with herbal notes and a lasting tannic bite. At over 15% alcohol, there's a lot of fire and toughness, so hold for a few more years and hopefully the tannins will soften.
The nose is light and attractive, with peach and floral accents. The mouth is perfectly smooth, with apple, melon and a hint of flint or steel. On the finish, some cinnamon spice adds character to the baked-apple flavors. With no flaws, this is the epitome of affordable, drinkable Chardonnay. Best Buy.
Included in the blend are small portions of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, but this is Merlot with a dark side all its own. Smoke, rubber and tar highlights augment a wine with black fruits, stiff tannins and threads of licorice and sage. It's not your mama's Merlot, but it's authoritative and interesting.
A short time in oak gives this wine its extra toasty, spicy character, that lies comfortably alongside the perfumed acidity and crisp lemony texture. It could age a few months, so wait to drink until 2017.
Aromas of plum, blue flowers and a whiff of truffle lead the nose. The juicy palate delivers fleshy black cherry accented with an earthy hint of game while fresh acidity and refined tannins give it an immediate, easy-drinking quality. Enjoy now.
Aromas of oak, toast and espresso lead the nose. Oak-driven spices takes center stage on the palate but don't mask the dried black cherry, plum, licorice vanilla and coffee in the background. Firm tannins provide structure. Drink through 2016.
Hard plum and berry aromas come with brushy herbal scents and a strong whiff of asphalt. The mouthfeel is forward and direct, with loud acidity. Blackberry, plum, herb and spice flavors dominate, while the finish is peppery and tastes of minty oak.
This wine offers loads of coffee and soft intensity, with ripe fruit, blackberry, rum cake and exotic spice. That extra roundness works well with this wine's high acidity and tannic structure.
This is brambly, stalky and baked on the nose, and the palate is wide, tannic and scratchy. The flavor profile is all roasted plum, bacon and herb accents, finishing stalky and savory.
Here's an easygoing (and well-priced) Nero d'Avola with fresh tones of cherry, blueberry and white almond. It's a compact and simple wine that would pair well with informal stay-home meals.
Estrecho means narrow in Spanish, and this varietal Monastrell is just that. After a compact, pure nose sets the stage, this feels sharp and puckery, with cheek-scouring acidity. The result is tart, bright cherry, currant and plum flavors followed by a high-toned, citric finish. Drink through 2024.
Smells and tastes cooked by heat, with raisiny, pruny, coffee flavors. Yet there's something likeable about this honest, bone-dry country wine.
This medium-bodied, slightly viscous Chardonnay displays restrained alcohol (12.8%) and little obvious oak influence. Tropical fruit notes are edged with grapefruit and lime, leaving a fresh impression on the finish. Drink now.
Good and dry, with very soft, refined tannins and complex flavors. Suffers a bit from arch acidity, but a nice steak should balance it. The delicious flavors include blackberry and cherry jam, licorice, charred meat and a hefty dose of freshly crushed black pepper.
No complaints—just praise for this clean, easy red from a great vintage. The nose is crisp and fruity, with welcome citrus and wood notes. Blackberry mixed with vanilla and chocolate create a pleasant palate, while the finish is round and tinged by mocha.
Aromas of ripe, rich cherry preserves perfume this plush, fruit-forward Cabernet Franc. Bold in body and texture, it's richly concentrated with red berry and cherry flavor. Finishes brightly with a streak of sour cherry acidity.
Brander's annual Bordeaux blend features 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Cabernet Franc and 10% Merlot. There is ripe boysenberry, cedar and worn leather on the nose, followed by Bing cherry flavors on the palate, where acidity and a light body combine for a lively finish.
Aromas of crushed blue flower, perfumed berry, exotic spice and a whiff of charcuterie emerge on this bold red. The concentrated palate offers dried black cherry, blackberry extract, licorice and ground pepper accompanied by firm, fine-grained tannins.
Burly, saucy and ultimately quite attractive on the nose, with leather and herbs in addition to more standard berry fruit and oak aromas. Not as chewy and soft as you might expect from a wine made by consultant du jour Carlo Ferrini; it's tannic and tight now, but exciting nonetheless. Hold through 2006. Imported by Selected Estates of Europe Ltd.
Beautifully fragrant of sweet black cherry and violet, this intensely fruity yet earthy wine is a standout within the Heart & Hands collection. Richly textured, it finishes with hints of spice, dried leaf and lingering, gentle tannins.
Sharp on the nose, with background aromas of cola, cedar and plum. Fairly tight and oaky on the palate, with a shot of lemon supporting plum and berry flavors. Sizable and solid, with some spice and red pepper on the finish. Imported by Empson (USA) Ltd.
Oaky, malty aromas blend well with dusty black-fruit and coffee scents. This crianza from a ripe, warm year is full and layered, with solid acidity. Black plum and wild-berry flavors are a touch raw and edgy. It finishes with toasty, blackened flavors of spice and wood. Drink through 2020.
A good everyday entry, this delivers honest fruit flavors that are spared the fake oak treatment. Cassis, black cherry, a light tobacco note, some fungus and dark, firm tannins combine gracefully. There is enough going on here to go head to head with a decent steak, and not vanish into the ether.
What a great aroma this wine has: refined oak and all the smoky, vanilla trimmings, framing pineapple, orange rind and lemon custard aromas and flavors. This massive Chard just gives off oodles of fruit. It is balanced with rich, brilliant acidity.
A beautiful, ultrafine Cabernet that shows rich blackberry, black currant, violet, cocoa and cedar flavors, and while it has tightly wound mountain tannins, it's entirely approachable now. A great, delicious success that's capable of aging for a good ten years, in a proper cellar. From the Davies family, of Schramsberg.
Somewhat stewy and leathery for starters, with a thick, creamy palate that shows stemmy, roasted plum and berry flavors. The feel is solid and thick, but the flavors don't really come around and settle.
This is a candy sweet, soft wine with flavors of pineapples, orange blossoms, apricots, peaches and caramel. Drink now.
While the trend among many Australian Cabernets is towards moderate, silky tannin structures, this austere, firm wine embraces its dry, dusty nature. Cedar and toast frame big cassis fruit, ending with chewy tannins. Drink 2018–2028.
This opens with aromas of toast, oak-driven spice and roasted coffee bean. The ripe palate doles out baked apple, candied citrus zest and crystallized ginger before bitter walnut closes the finish.
A spicy, nutty wine that shows some of the Meursault broadness but also offers some subtlety, with ripe fruits layered with more complex wood and herb flavors. This could age well over the next 2–3 years.
This blend of 43% Grenache, 20% Cinsault, 20% Syrah and 17% Petite Sirah offers boisterous berry, cherry and plum-juice aromas on the nose. Black-cherry juice flavors dominate the ripe palate. This would make a great wine for backyard barbecues with burgers and ribs.
The blend is 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 19% Merlot, 15% Cabernet Franc and 6% Petit Verdot, which in this case has yielded a wine that is a bit austere on the palate, marked by taut acids and crisp berry fruit. Some herbal overtones are apparent as well. This is not an overweight Barossa wine by any means.
Intense, complex and full-bodied, this is a powerful Pinot Gris. It has weight and richness, providing both fruitiness and a ripe texture. Ready to drink, with the acidity lifting the finish.
This is the kind of fun, flirty white that won't break the bank or your brain—it's simple and sippable. The nose offers pineapple, lemon and a touch of toast, while the fruit flavors are bright and appealing. Could use a touch of acidity but overall, the wine is balanced. A good everyday choice.
Sweet up front, with a heaping of wood spice on top of raisin and baked berry aromas. This is a big, full-bodied mature wine with tannins that are still grabbing and flavors of roasted blackberry, dark plum and ingrained spice. Finishes long, toasty and sweet, with some heat and a distinct baked quality. Drink now.
Very golden and even nearing brown in color, this wine by the Paso Rhône pioneer shows walnut oil, honey and dried lemon peel on the nose. It's not so dense on the palate, offering an essence of brown pear and orange rinds. It could use a touch more mellowing in the bottle.
This Pinot overcomes a somewhat murky appearance by offering an interesting mix of earth, tomato leaf, pepper and granite, along with very tart red fruits. It's textural and chewy, with substantial tannins, but it's also flavorful and dense, and for the relatively modest price it shows some real muscle.
Citrus and soft red berry flavors are restrained on nose and palate of this pale, pink and slender rosé. But the bone-dry nature of the wine makes for great refreshment. Drink soon.
Very flavorful and generous, this wine has bright berry aromas, a mouth-filling, smooth mousse and vibrant, ripe raspberry and cherry flavors.
A bittersweet apple element gives this wine an intellectual component, tempering its richer crème brûlée-like flavors. Medium-bodied, with crisp acidity, it shows off the estate vineyard site well, in a well-regarded vintage.
A fine Cabernet, one of the best from Sonoma Valley. It's dry and firm in tannins, with complex black cherry, licorice, mocha and cedar flavors. A little softer and broader than a comparably-priced Napa Cab, it's no less ageworthy. Drink now–2020.
A round, chewy wine with a nice mix of black fruit, vanilla, aged cheese and light balsam wood on the nose. The palate is big but doesn't bite back, and the flavors of creamy berry are broad and nice. A very solid wine with weight and heat; drink now through 2011.
With some weight behind it, this is a ripe Champagne, with cherry and raspberry fruit and attractive lime acidity. There is a good bite in the aftertaste.
Ripe notions of fruit—typical for 2015—are apparent from the word go. There is juicy yellow plum and even a hint of tropicality—pineapple perhaps. This is rich and rounded, balanced with generous lemon freshness and textured with lees contact. There is weight on the midpalate, which leaves a lasting, if juicy impression.
From the faraway 1998 vintage, this lovely sparkling blend from northern Italy delivers a suave, smooth personality with complex layers of toasted baguette, honey-roasted almond, candied orange and ripe peach. Great intensity and a bitter almond finish cap the enduring mouthfeel.
Aromas of white rose, sage, citrus and grapefruit carry over to the palate along with ripe peach and orange zest. It's semisweet and lightly sparkling, with a slightly sweet finish and a frothy mousse.
Here's a compact and easy Müller-Thurgau that shows medium aromatic intensity with citrus, peach and brimstone. The wine's crisp, dry close with its subtle touch of honey makes it perfect for fried finger foods or tempura.
A densely grassy, almost New Zealand style of Sauvignon Blanc, packed with intense flavors. It is crisp, but the green fruits are rounded out and given greater flavor by red apple juice, a tight texture and vivid finishing acidity.
Soft, ripe and fruity, this is a smooth and clean wine. It has yellow fruit, pineapple and white currant flavors that give a perfumed edge. It's not a wine for aging, so drink now.
From one of Taurasi's rising stars, this gorgeous wine opens with enticing scents of underbrush, just-picked violet, dark berry and a whiff of cake spice. The balanced, full-bodied palate delivers layers of mature black cherry, raspberry, cinnamon, carob and cocoa while firm but refined tannins and fresh acidity provide an elegant, age-worthy structure. It's already tempting but hold for more complexity. Drink 2018–2033.
Truffle, fig, underbrush, toast and chopped mint aromas emerge in the glass along with a whiff of cocoa. The firm palate shows dried black cherry, cinnamon, clove and star anise alongside assertive tannins that need to unwind. Drink 2018–2024.
Pizzolato brings us an easygoing Pinot Grigio with a thin, watery mouthfeel and measured aromas of citrus, white mineral and passion fruit. This informal style of wine works well at outdoor lunches and barbecues.
Nicely dry and tart for a Paso Robles white wine, this has flavors of sour pineapple candy, barely ripe pear, tobacco and Provençal herb. The acidity really kicks in, making the mouth water. This is versatile and should pair with a wide range of fare.
Despite the Columbia Valley label this is all Red Mountain, old-vine Merlot from the winery's estate vineyard. Raspberry, mocha, clove and spice aromas lead to supple, understated fruit flavors and an extended finish. It's a perfect example of what makes this variety special in Washington.
A serious, fairly rich wine with grippy tannins and typical Maipo aromas of herbs, tobacco and olive that meet at eucalyptus. Hails from low-production old vines in Macul and Buin; the wine is round and full in the mouth, with lightly roasted berry flavors and touches of sweet caramel and chocolate on the finish.
Smooth and opulent, this immediately appeals with its generous fruit and texture that feels like velvet. The structure sits under the seductive surface, with a chocolate wood flavor, fruit tannins and density. Age for over 10 years at least.
One of a growing number of micro-boutiques in Oregon, Vidon made its first wine in 2003. Subsequent vintages were quickly sold out, with quantities as low as two barrels of individual wines. This 2007 is in better supply, and well worth seeking out. Fragrant with sweet strawberries, hints of fresh herb, a Dr. Pepper soda streak particular to Oregon and nicely laid-in oak, it's a seductive and focused effort that masks its high alcohol effectively.
This limited production blend of Arinto and Baga is tight, taut and creamy. Initial intense acidity is balanced by citrus fruits and a lively, bright mousse. The wine has an impressive depth of flavor, richly endowed with fruit, yeastiness and the ability to age further. Drink now, but better from 2018.
Delicate, subdued and feminine, here is a luminous sparkler with pretty floral tones and light shadings of stone fruit and melon. You'll love its delicate, creamy texture and long peachy finish.
The proprietor—you guessed it, Allan Scott—doesn't like herbaceousness in Sauvignon Blanc and you can tell from the ripeness and lack of green flavors in his wine. Instead, there's mild grapefruit coupled with melon and passion fruit.
The first impression is of grain and soda crackers. The wine is tart, with a mix of orange peel, baby aspirin and lemon custard flavors. It finishes rather sharp-edged, with a hint of heat, and a lot of acid.
Toasty and mealy on the nose, evidencing good integration of oak with the lush tropical fruit flavors typical of Gisborne Chardonnay. Plump on the palate without being heavy, then unleashes notes of buttered popcorn on the finish. Imported by Foster's Wine Estates Americas.
Graham Tatomer is bringing Austria to California with his exciting wines, in this case delivering aromas of tight banana, poached apple and guava along with steely gunmetal. There is great zing on the tip of the palate, with apple and pear as well as a lime zest backbone.
This is a cohesive and well-integrated blend of 34% Cabernet Franc, 29% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot, 9% Petit Verdot and 8% Malbec. It offers blackberry, black currant, cedar, toasty oak, violets, roast beef, black pepper and pencil lead on the nose. The well-hewn palate combines pepper and blackberry at the tip of the sip, followed by oaky vanilla and a touch of pine. it's very well focused.
Aromas of orange rind and lemon zest are almost overpowering and are followed by sweets tastes of mature citrus or candied fruit. In fact, this well extracted wine recalls many of the smells and tastes you get from candied orange peels. One obvious pairing solution is duck a l'orange.
Aromas of bright berry, blue flower and savory herb lead the nose. The palate offers raw cherry, espresso, oak and anise alongside bracing, rather astringent tannins.
Just a whiff of this deep gold Vidal Blanc reveals layers of smoke melded with honey and fresh apples. The palate is deeply complex with flavors that include pretty florals, rich pineapple, citrus and a compelling smoked nut skin note. The super-long finish is marked by zippy acidity and a lovely astringency.
This bottling, which is both a reference to the Lynyrd Skynyrd song and an ode to the grape growers, offers vibrant blackberry, slate and vanilla aromas. The palate is ripe and juicy but balanced, with tangy plum skin and dark spice flavors, framed by a chalky tannic structure. It's fruity enough for traditional California Zinfandel fans but complex enough to win converts.
A broad as well as crisp wine that has great fresh, beautifully polished ripe pear fruit, lightly nutty in character.
This wine is 42% Cabernet Sauvignon, 26% Merlot, 23% Cabernet Franc and 9% Malbec from Hedges Estate, Red Mountain, Stillwater and Weinbau vineyards. It's youthful at present, with aromas of woodspice, coffee, blackberry and graphite. The palate displays muscular fruit flavors surrounded by a framework of dry, chewy tannins.
Green elements are often frowned upon in New World Bordeaux, but this wine shows why that's flawed thinking. Black pepper and sour cherry accompany vibrant jalapeño on the nose. That vivid herbaceous character extends to the palate, making for an intriguing, eye-opening drink. Why not pair with chile relleno?
This is a stunning wine that's loaded with flavor and complexity. The vibrant bouquet boasts assertive, fruity aromas of kirsch, blueberry and blackberry, alongside notes of iris, dark chocolate and a touch of sweet tobacco. The palate is full and ripe, with powerful, dense black-fruit and berry flavors that are laced with a hint of cream and sweet cocoa. Firm yet well-integrated tannins grip the long finish. Decadent now, but should hold nicely through 2017.
Resiny oak and mildly stalky berry aromas muscle out cherry and raspberry scents. This feels grabby and clampy, while oaky flavors of mixed berries and baked plum end with coconut-infused oak flavors and notes of raisin and licorice. Drink through 2020.

Brilliant garnet in color, it has aromas of cherry vanilla, cherry pie, cranberry juice and pomegranate that transfer seamlessly onto the palate. It's medium bodied with a pleasant acidic backbone in the midpalate. The finish is long and luxurious with a surprising splash of cherry vanilla at the end.
A wine with great color, attractive smoky and red fruit flavors and a touch of tannin. It has a good structure as well, reflecting wood aging as well as fine fruit. Drink from 2016.
Intensely liquorous, this is a wine whose richness comes from concentrated botrytis over honey and lemon acidity. It is very ripe, rather than hugely sweet, with a final burst of freshness, giving a positive lift. Delicious, it needs aging for 5–10 years.
This opens with funky aromas of game, cured meat and wet animal fur. Rustic and lean, the astringent palate offers a suggestion of powdered sage and a balsamic note but lacks fruit.
Lush with aromas of ripe red plums and cherries with a hint of warm, golden toast, this is a charming everyday wine that's easy to drink yet offers a satisfying degree of depth. Bright acidity, tart Morello cherry flavors and soft tannins meld elegantly on the palate, leading to a finish that's rich with mocha and dark, toasted oak.
This innovative Cretan producer hits the mark with this pretty, fragrant white blend including the island's hallmark white, Vidiano. The nose is full of flowers, white peach fruit and rip citrus, while on the palate, an interplay of exotic fruit and minerality keep the wine focused but friendly. A great wine for spicy Indian cuisine or sushi.
This has intense acids and tannins that make it feel a bit rustic. But despite the structure, it has delicious, upfront flavors of blackberry, plum, currant, beef jerky, sweet oak and pepper. Drink now.
A kaleidoscope of sweet, sun-kissed fruit, this dazzling kabinett offers an array of glazed grapefruit, tangerine and stone fruit flavors.

Drink now through 2021 to enjoy its youthful exuberance.
Typical of this hot vintage, La Fiammenga is already quite mature. The fruit is on the plummy side, it has the added complexity of licorice and road tar. On the palate, it is soft and rich but it does need a touch of acid to liven it up. Imported by Sapori Italiani Inc.
This wine offers a somewhat untoward combination of herbs, nori, tire rubber and blue fruit. Flavors are sharp-edged backed by chalky tannins.
A beautifully ripe and complex wine, this 100% Touriga Nacional from the mountainous interior shows great elegance and fragrance along with power and richness. It brings out the granite terroir with its strongly mineral, steely texture, still giving room for the black currant fruit. Drink this ageworthy wine from 2017.
It's a big wine in terms of an inky color and very firm tannins but it does not come across as overly full-bodied, and the alcohol level is moderate. Enough blackberry flavor and acidity come through to keep it balanced just this side of extreme. This should improve through 2018.
Blended from a range of vineyards, this tasty, toasty wine cloaks its raspberry fruit in chocolate malt-like flavor. Its components are clearly defined, fresh and appealing, and it showcases the sophisticated house style in a more widely-distributed, less expensive offering.
This is a seriously good Cabernet, and the price makes it a relative bargain. Dry and tannic, it has complex flavors of blackberries, black currants, blueberries and plenty of new smoky oak. A tangy minerality lifts it above the ordinary. It will hold in the bottle until at least 2020.
This rich, ripe wine hits all your Chardonnay sweet spots. It's honeyed in tropical fruits, with oaky notes of buttered toast and vanilla. The best thing is the clean, zesty acidity.
Pale gold in color. Dominant resiny aromas. Slightly funky with notes of honey, earthy mushroom and ripe stone fruit. Broad on the palate with similar earthy flavors prevailing, warm  with some spice and creaminess. Fairly rich texture, but lacking freshness and a shortish finish.
Here's a nice, smooth Pinot Noir meant for drinking now. It's dry and silky, with attractive flavors of cola, cherries, raspberries, spices and smoke.
The Vigneto Cerequio cru has produced remarkable results in 2004 for all the producers who farm here including Batasiolo. This wine offers bright notes of cherry and blackberry that are followed by warm tones of vanilla, spice, licorice and smoke. It's got a lot going on in the mouth thanks to the wine's lively flavors and firm consistency.
Crisp and savory, this lively white delivers aromas and flavors of mature yellow apple, nectarine zest and a hint of nut. Bright acidity gives it refreshing support.
The palest of grey-pink rosés, this is classy, fresh and fragrant. It has a light, orange-zest texture as well as tannins and a mineral edge. Very fresh, it is also worth aging a few months.
A generous body and oak stand out most in this wine, which leans sour in tannin and bittersweet chocolate more than fruit. A forest-floor component keeps it savory, with a taste of yeasty bread.
Flashy and flamboyant, this Merlot seduces with scads of toasty oak in keeping with the size of the blackberry, cherry and cocoa fruit. The tannins are soft and sweet, the finish elegant. If it was any softer, it would collapse, but the acids and tannins work.
Very juicy if straightforward aromas of blueberry and blackberry rise off of this fun and easy-drinking Syrah from the Carhartt family, whose estate is in the middle of the Santa Ynez Valley. The palate builds on those ripe elements with a bit of tar and dried fruit.
Hard tannins give taut astringency to this wine. But then, that's the signature of Three Palms, which always starts life tight and tough. Made since 1978 by Duckhorn, the wine has shown a consistency rare among Merlot single-vineyard bottlings. This 2010 shows Three Palm's hard tannins, but has such lush black cherry and mocha fruit that it's easy to drink now. It's a worthy followup to the magnificent 2009, but better structured. Drink now–2020.

Rich, forward and delicious, this has pineapple and peach jam flavors, with elaborate notes of buttered toast and caramel from the oak aging. It finishes dry.
Kerner is a variety not often seen in the U.S., although it is among the top five most planted white grapes in Germany. It's a cross between Trollinger (a red grape) and Riesling, making for—in this case—a pretty, aromatic white with hints of muskmelon, tropical fruit, maybe even some red berries, all on a light frame. Long and refreshing on the finish.
A Bordeaux-style blend from the extra barrels in the multi-wine Long Shadows lineup, this nicely proportioned wine includes 54% Cabernet Sauvignon, 24% Merlot, and smaller amounts of Cab Franc, Petit Verdot and Malbec. Superb vineyard sources—Weinbau, Wallula, Champoux and StoneTree—along with aging in new French oak marks this as a wine with high-end aspirations. Smoky, oaky, textural and complex.
Easy and carefree, this fruity Nero d'Avola offers a no-brainer solution to hamburgers or outdoor barbecue food. The wine shows aromas of blueberry, cherry and white almond.
What's really nice about this wine is that it offers mellow, soft structure behind its vibrant cherry flavors. If you're looking for a good, solid Valpolicella to pair with all kinds of easy, home-cooked meals, Villa Novare is a sure bet.
A firmly structured wine, revealing all the Malbec tannic character. The extra year's aging has rounded the wine, filling it out with black tarry fruit. It is firm and dense, with good richness.
Neutral on the nose, with modest sweet berry aromas but not much more. Feels heavy and buttery, with baked berry flavors bolstered by loud oak that tastes buttery and creamy. Chunky, ripe, buttery and sweet on the finish.
This perfumed wine has light, ripe fruits and soft tannins. Red cherry and raspberry flavors dominate the palate of a wine that is still young. Drink this attractive wine from 2017.
A blend of blocks and clones from this impressive property, this Pinot delivers pretty raspberry and cherry fruit, dusted with baking spices. From the opening aromas of fruit and flower, on through to the bigger barrel flavors of clove and cinnamon, this is a lovely wine, drinking well, but certainly fit for cellaring through 2020–2022.
This Coda di Volpe has a subdued nose that lets aromas of chopped herb and mineral reveal themselves slowly. It's tonic and firm with good crispness and an easy overall approach. A Marc de Grazia selection, various American importers.
This does not offer much in terms of aromas other than measured tones of stone fruit and shadings of white mineral. It is equally as easy and informal in the mouth.
Fairly straightforward and solid Merlot from Chile. The nose is sort of brambly, but there's reasonably fresh plum and berry aromas. The palate is acid-charged and thus not sloppy or muddled, with bright cherry and red-plum flavors. Hints of pepper and herbs accent a zesty finish.
Tight and tannic, the wine reveals acidity, structure and red cherry juice flavors. There is a definite minerality here, giving the wine an austere feel. It needs a year or two to be at its best.
Cola, root beer and herbal fruit carry the nose into a fairly balanced, old-school palate that features crisp cherry, raspberry and citrus flavors. This is made from Tempranillo and it's a bit like an '80s model cru bourgeois Bordeaux.
This is a light-bodied Pinot Noir, perfectly fine for the price. Some mushroomy elements don't mesh perfectly with the otherwise confected maraschino cherry fruit, but the wine is varietally recognizable, with lithe tannins and a fresh, slightly herbal finish.
With sweet flavors of honey, pineapple, mango and pear, followed by an oak-driven buttered toast note, this delivers more for the price than many Americans will expect. Zippy acidity keeps everything clean and balanced.
At a time when many others have dropped Sangiovese from their portfolios, Amador Foothill remains committed to the great grape of Tuscany. The wine is medium-bodied and soft, somewhat like a warm-climate Merlot, with a pepper edge to the cherry and red currant flavors. It finishes dry and elegant.
This perfumed, new-wood-flavored wine is clear-cut and structured. Firm tannins are layered with black fruits and touches of perfumed violets, allied with solid structure. It fills the glass with ripe aromas, while acidity at the end gives a final lift. Drink from 2016, although the wine can be enjoyed now.
Flavorful and sweet but not cloying, it displays plenty of floral and apricot aromas, ripe honeylike flavors and a rich finish. Will pair nicely with cheese and salted nuts as an apéritif, or with biscotti for dessert.
This remains tight and somewhat impenetrable, with focused, tart flavors of red berry, lemon and pineapple. The scent of oak references considerable time in 40% new barrels. Once the fruit flavors fade, it's mostly acid that remains in the finish.
A nicely drinkable Chardonnay marked by vigorous acidity and creamy-smooth flavors of pineapple tart, Key lime pie and lemongrass. Good as an inexpensive alternative to coastal bottlings that cost far more.
This exciting project comes from veteran winemaker William Hill. Although it's packed with rich black-currant and cassis-liqueur flavors that sink down in the midpalate and offer fruity satisfaction, the finish is firm and classic. The vineyard is on Atlas Peak, and the wine shows those mountain tannins but also fine minerality. Drink 2017–2025.
Warm, crusty and attractive up front, with a ripe blend of plum, raspberry and pepper flavors. Seems plush and focused for such an inexpensive wine, yet it's also a little bit juicy and wild. Made in the fresh style that Borsao excels at. Drink now.
This Gironde-inspired blend of 80% Sauvignon Blanc and 20% Sémillon is solid now, but will be far more interesting in the years to come. Aromas of wet slate and wet wool meet with Pink Lady apples and green, grassy meadows on the nose. The mineral-focused palate shows graphite and steel touches, with angular grass tones that lead into a warmed touch of toast on the finish. Drink 2018–2025.
This is an attractive, fruit-driven Syrah at an approachable price. Violets and pepper mark the blueberry-scented nose, while the flavors bit up darker notes of blackberry and licorice on the finish. Drink this medium-bodied wine over the next few years.
Tart red cherries and plum skins are spiced by nutmeg, pepper and turned earth on this widely available bottling that packs decent Pinot punch for the price. The mix of ripe and tart plays hard on the palate, where red cherry pie toys with cranberry skins, and a dollop of vanilla carries the midpalate.
Opens with scratchy, dusty aromas of red fruits and herbs. The palate is round but clunky, with sweet, grapy flavors of blackberry and blueberry. Finishes rather oaky and mild, with a grainy feel.
Good blackberry, herb and cedar flavors in this ultra-dry wine. But it's hard in tannins that don't seem likely to age out.
A streak of iron and mineral leads, with rich, ripe, dark fruit flavors following. Compact and tannic, this is extremely young. But compressed in the wine are complex streaks of herb and mineral. The tannins are strong and polished.
Simple and fruity, this has berry flavors that mingle with floral acidity, soft tannins and a rounded texture. Ready to drink.
Fruity and easy to drink, but not a good representation of this famous mountain vineyard, at this price. The wine is sweet and simple in candied raspberries, blackberries, licorice and milk chocolate. Maybe it was released too early. Try cellaring for a couple years.
Cabernet Sauvignon in Provence seems to evoke the herbal wild-thyme character of the countryside. This wine has weight to its black fruit flavors, with an edge from its tannins and acidity. It could age for 2–3 years. Screwcap.
Rusty in color, this is gritty, murky and stewy on the nose. Stewy, mulchy, sweet berry flavors finish bitter and leafy.
From the village just west of Puligny-Montrachet, this is ripe, round and creamy. A good value for white Burgundy, it shows a touch of wood and a generous character. Its acidity and fruit are already well in balance. Drink from late 2017.
An aromatically arresting wine with a complex medley of corn silk, cream and an assortment of spices. It's on the lighter side, elegant in its styling, with tart lemony acidity that runs from head to tail and a lingering finish.
Promising juicy ripeness of peach and mirabelle appears on the nose. The palate takes this rounded fruitiness and frames it with intense lemon freshness. The palate is concentrated and fluid, shot through with freshness and verve. Dry and refreshing.
Perfectly serviceable Marlborough Sauvignon, with slightly sweaty-musky aromas and passion fruit scents, followed by more subdued flavors and a short, fresh finish.
Cherry and raspberry aromas are rubbery and show a fair amount of creamy, artificial-smelling oak. This is chewy and resiny in feel, with jammy flavors of raspberry, plastic and vanilla. Heat and oak are the prime players on a weak finish.
While not as full-bodied and complex as the winery's Les Pionniers bottling, their Tradition is considerably less expensive. Like Pionniers, it's unoaked and bright with acidity, with savory citrus and tropical fruit, green grass, honey and spice flavors.
This fragrant, thoroughly delicious blend is the most widely available offering from this esteemed grower/producer. Floral highlights, ripe cherry fruit, and lightly herbal, slightly stiff tannins are in balance, and show the muscle and structure of a big wine still in its infancy. Tuck it away for a couple more years and watch it blossom.
Finely framed and cut by a lasered edge of acidity, this feather-light spätlese is a showcase of Riesling's ethereal textures. Crisp melon rind and grapefruit flavors fill out the midpalate, finishing on a long, lingering slick of honey and subtle cashew notes. Lovely now, but likely to intensify well into the 2020's.
Smoky aromas of graphite, road tar and wild berry set up a wiry, full-force palate with a can't-miss beam of tartaric acidity. Blackberry and chocolaty flavors finish forward, with unabashed freshness and drive. Drink through 2019.
Creamy malty aromas of vanilla and baked berry fruits lead to an astringent palate with hard tannins. This Malbec tastes earthy and like baked berry fruits and coffee grounds. A grabby finish with clamping residual tannins makes for a rugged ending.
Dark red-violet in color, this offers aromas of cherry, seawater and molasses, while flavors suggest cherry, cranberry, smoked meat, mocha, mint and eucalyptus. Cool notes outweigh fruit flavors, leading to a sense that something is off balance. Strong tannins back off on a bright finish that fails to diminish the minty notes.
Giant and black, with extracted but pruney aromas that are sweet and raisiny. The palate is chunky, with raisin, fig and black plum flavors. Sweet but falls flat on the finish; has its good qualities but frankly it's an overripe wine.
A very fine effort in this price range. It opens with a soft, varietally pure, very pretty nose, scents of cherries and vanilla lightly kissed with herbal spices. The wine tightens up in the mouth,  and shows some spine and near-term aging potential.
A dark and smoky wine, with that charred, smoky note most evident in the nose. Streaks of vanilla and black tea run through the core flavors. Substantial, perhaps enough to match to a thick steak.
Sourced from Cold Creek and StoneTree vineyards, this spent 20 months in new French oak. The barrel aging puts a big frame of toast and spice around the blueberry/blackberry fruit, and continues into a finish with some unresolved tannins that turn bitter. Give this more time to pull the fruit and barrel flavors together.
Once again this vineyard delivers irresistibly bright refined flavors of raspberry and cherry fruit—primary, concentrated and immaculately fresh. There's a touch of mocha from the new barrels, and impressive length. As with all of Trisaetum's single vineyard Pinots, this is built for cellaring, and should drink best after another couple of years in bottle. Drink 2018–2028, perhaps beyond.
Fragrant and fresh, this is a great bright, crisp Vinho Verde. The acidity is intense, balanced with an elegant softer texture. It just cries out for seafood.
This is a first release from the winery's estate vineyard, high atop the Mayacamas Mountains overlooking Alexander Valley. It's intense and concentrated in pineapple crème brûlée, peach purée, green apple, honeysuckle and smoky sandalwood flavors, undergirded with a firm minerality. Delicious and compelling, and should develop over the next six years.
There's a hint of smoke throughout the nose and palate that adds a layer of complexity to this sweet, pretty Riesling. Aromas of honeysuckle blossoms combine with the freshness of pressed apples and a bright, high-toned acidity. Smoke, slate and stone kick in to create a long, elegant finish. Overall, a well balanced, enjoyable wine.
The appellation is North Coast, with the fruit sourced from Mendocino and Lake Counties. It's pale in color and delicate in structure, with raspberry, tangerine zest and fig newton flavors brightened by hefty acidity. Defines a light, elegant style, and it's a steal at this price.
From the far-away 1994 vintage, this aged metodo classico sparking wine (made with 80% Chardonnay with Pinots Nero and Bianco) opens with a deep golden color and aromas of mature fruit, apricot and butterscotch. There's a note of flatness or slight oxidation.
Bright and savory, this offers aromas of wild berry, lilac, baking spice and a whiff of menthol. On the palate, notes of grilled herb, coffee and aniseed accent the wild cherry core while chewy tannins offer support.
Joey Tensley departs from his usual dark fruit intensity to weave together a more chaparral spice-driven Rhône-style blend in this bottling, which shows marjoram, bay leaf and sweet sage on the nose. The palate packs those dried herbs onto a beef roast, throwing in dusty earth and dried berries to round out the sip.
Tastes like a cherry-berry fruit drink with lots of acidity, giving it a sweet-sour flavor. At least the alcohol is low.
Coffee, toasted hazelnut, espresso bean and vanilla ride in the forefront of black fruit and cherry. This is a bold, big and modern Barbera d'Alba with ripe fruit tones and soft wood nuances that help dull the grape's natural acidity.
Vineyard redevelopment and a new winery contributed to this fine expression of ripe Alicante Bouschet wine under the direction of Catarina Vieira. It's rich and structured, reflecting the grape. The dark color and powerful spice and black-fruit flavors are right up front to give a dense wine that will always be firm. The wine comes in a very heavy bottle.
Grapefruit aromas, bright kiwi and apple flavors and appetizing acidity make a lively, refreshing wine. This will be thirst-quenching on hot summer days and good with seafood, goat cheese and many other dishes any time of the year.
Clean if slightly sweet notes of apple, Meyer lemon pith, honeydew melon, peach blossom and bubblegum show on the nose of this bottling. It's quite light on the palate, with touches of light pear and apple, with that bubblegum touch arising as well.
A little hard at first, with match stick aromas. After that blows off, there's green fruit notes carrying the nose. Full in the mouth, with acidic cut and spunky flavors of nectarine and orange. Finishes round, with citrus and passion fruit.
A finely soft wine, with concentrated ripe fruit that just demands to be drunk now. Red fruits, sweet jelly flavors and soft tannins come together into an enticing blend.
Soft notes of rose petal and peach compote animate the nose. A restrained, floral medium sweetness envelopes the palate, shimmering with notes of honeysuckle and bitter grapefruit pith. Gently balanced, this wine has just the right amount of floral perfume.
Citrusy in style, with aromas of orange, passion fruit and grapefruit. Feels flush and full-bodied, with basic tangerine and navel orange flavors. Fresh on the finish but hollow in terms of depth, with a light fade.
Intricately detailed, framed in beautifully scented oak, a rich, ageable wine with a soft delicacy that's almost feminine. Flavors veer toward sweet blackcurrants, green olives and chocolate-covered cherries, coating the palate with a long-lasting aftertaste. Beautiful, elegant.
The aromas are brooding, with notes of orange peel, mineral, raspberry and cranberry. The palate is flavorful yet reserved with a lingering fruit-filled finish.
This is a big, burly Barolo with chunky, slightly drying tannins and an enchanting nose that delivers earth and mineral notes alongside rose petals and tar. Mature and drinking well now but could be laid down for those who like softer, more developed wines. Screams for a well-marbled steak.
Plum, cassis, herb and spice aromas make for a full, pleasant bouquet. This shows a thick tannic plodding palate along with quick-hitting berry and cassis flavors. Lasting acidity on the finish creates welcome freshness and length.
In this wine, red berries and currants burst out of the glass. These are balanced with apple and citrus acidity to give a wine that is all about delicious fruit and refreshing acidity. Drink now.
Plunk down the extra coin for the JC Reserve Riesling. The aromas are exactly what you'd expect in a Riesling—floral, citrusy and minerally all at once—while the flavors of green apple and lime are stony without being hard. A lean, surprisingly elegant wine that delicately fades on the finish. Imported by Pernod Ricard USA.
A touch raisiny and sweet from nose to tail, but what's in between is convincing for Jumilla. Aromas of licorice and herbs are sweet but nice, while the flavors or raisin and blackberry are chunky, with a basic finish that's a little flat but definitely ripe. A blend of Monastrell, Cabernet, Tempranillo and Merlot that's ready to drink.
Light, rather thin Merlot fruit is coated with lush flavors of licorice and vanilla. The oak treatment may seem over the top to some, just right to others. There's plenty of acid to wash the palate clean.
Marks a welcome return to the magnificence of the 2002, although more recent vintages haven't exactly been slouches. The '05 is amazing, a densely structured, deeply flavored Bordeaux blend that's mainly Cabernet Sauvignon. Shows classic notes of cassis, currants and black cherry liqueur, while 70% new oak adds enticingly rich layers of sweet toast and smoky vanilla. The tannins are pure, classic Napa, very refined and ripe, offering solid structural support with no trace of astringency. Beautiful now, and should slowly develop for many years.
Fruit forward aromas of blueberry compote, blackberry and boysenberry blend notably well with a savory note of feral raw meat. On the palate, juicy acids make the berry flavors pop, while the chewy but integrated tannins set up the structured finish.
Classy, dry Chardonnay with an angular flint-smoke-lime bouquet. There's ample oak here, and the fruit is present but quite reigned-in, with a crisp palate feel similar to Chablis. Tasty, long, and drinkable now, this will benefit from a year in the bottle.
Soapy smelling and a touch dull to start with. The palate is wet but doesn't deliver much kick, while the flavor profile includes lettuce greens, peach and apple. Fleshy but bland on the finish; drink right away.
Moderately floral aromas of stone fruits and fresh carrot juice feed into a round palate that's balanced and well shaped. Nectarine and peach flavors are nice and easy. This wine is slightly leesy-tasting on a medium-length finish.
Beautiful now, with a lovely texture and delicious flavors, this could even benefit from a couple years in the cellar. The vineyard is very fine, and Lost Canyon has a good track record with it. The flavors of cherries, black raspberries, licorice, cola and spice are ever shifting, making you want to try a second, third, fourth sip. Best now–2009, before it loses vitality.
The bouquet offers a strong blast of toasty oak along with apple, lemon and mango. This is no weak wine; in fact, it hits maximum overdrive in terms of zesty fruit and raw power. A full-force experience, with subtlety not really coming into play.
This full-bodied red features aromas of underbrush, tilled soil, dark berry, new leather and a whiff of game. The concentrated palate offers ripe black cherry, licorice, mocha and a note of pipe tobacco alongside firm, velvety tannins. It's already ripe and accessible but will also age well for the next decade at least. Drink 2016– 2025.
This excellent Riesling proves that the 2006 Stone's Throw Vineyard was no fluke. Heather Neff is a winemaker who understands the grape, and seems to be out in front exploring the possibilities for Riesling in Washington's emerging Lake Chelan wine region. Fragrant with honeycomb, beeswax and a mix of citrus blossoms, this lively wine is rich without being tiring, off-dry but not sweet or sugary, and delicately balanced through an extended finish.
Mint and jammy plum and raspberry aromas are a touch spicy. This is astringent in feel, with dry, oaky red-berry and tomato flavors. An angular, tart finish fades quickly.
This has ebullient aromas of cherry blossom, grapefruit and yuzu peel. Structurally complex, this has concentrated flavors of sour plum and pink grapefruit. It's brisk with acidity, and there's a lavish minerality that lingers long on the finish.
Ripe black fruit and spicy, smoky scents pull you into this smooth and lush gem of a Syrah. Dense and fruit-driven, it's a showcase of the superripe 2003 vintage, which blessed Washington's Syrahs with unprecedented power.
94-96 Barrel sample. A superbly elegant wine that hides its power well. There are dry tannins, blackberry fruits, elevated acidity, and just a hint of raisins.
Attractively perfumed this ripe wine has hints of the crisp acidity that is also there. It's a fresh wine with the potential of richness. Ripe pink grapefruit and tangy acidity are balanced by the warmer flavors of pear and quince. Drink from late 2015.
Crisp and direct, showing bright, flamboyant pineapples, kiwis, figs, Meyer lemons and vanilla.
Drink this Merlot with burgers at a party. It's dry and tannic, with some satisfying black currant, licorice and green tea flavors.
This is dry, but not quite bone dry. The richness of the smooth Pinot Noir is enough to round out the crisp apple and lime flavors, giving it a wonderful brightness. It could be aged, though its freshness makes it drinkable now.
This is a beautiful Cabernet that shows the gentle tannins and herbaceous edge of Rutherford Cabernets, but doesn't stint on richness. It's dry, smooth and appealing in black and red cherry, red currant, licorice, bacon and sandalwood flavors, and is complex enough to age for a decade.
Crisp grapefruit and lemon aromas and simple, fresh citrus flavors give this white a fun, easygoing appeal. Balanced acid and fruit and a spicy finish add to the package. A good go-to white.
Pressed apple and pears are dusted in pollen and saffron in this earth-toned Spätlese. Delicately sweet honey tones brighten the midpalate, accompanied by bracing lemonade acidity. The finish is moderately long, marked by a lingering touch of dried herbs.
Big and smoky, it discloses fruit as well as solid tannins. The wine has power and density, with black fruits that show sweetness. It will be delicious but the structure does need to soften first. Drink from 2017.
Toffee, black cherry and orange combine around a softened, yet tightly woven layer of leather and bitter espresso bean in this full-bodied, robust Zinfandel with an approachable palate.
Temperance Hill grapes are sourced for this Pinot Noir project. Barrel spices dominate, with tart berry fruit in the background. It's a solid effort, though it thins out and feels a bit stripped in the finish.

None of the current-release Indomita wines have struck a chord, including this hard, rubbery, barnyardy Carmenère. It's semi-sour, sharp-edged and tangy, with an angular finish and a stinky essence.
Raspingly dry and tannicly astringent, with barely any fruit at all, this Zin is  clean, at least.
This is a sweet style of Prosecco with a luminous appearance and grassy-herbal notes followed by white peach, honey and jasmine. More herbal flavors appear on the close and the wine is fresh and simple in the mouth.
The aromas of blue and red fruit are direct and appealing, with dried herbs providing a grace note. The currant flavors are plump with lightly grainy tannins backing them up.
The Symington family continues to make strides in their table wine production. This is a full-bodied, smooth-textured bistro-styled red that's more of a dark purple in hue, bringing blackberry, blueberry and spice and mineral notes to the table. Enjoy it over the next year or two for its exuberant fruit. Imported by Premium Port Wines, Inc.
A bit fudge-like, with thick, soft flavors of chocolate and cassis joined by herbal notes of thyme or tea. Turns a bit drying on the finish.
Pine needles, rhubarb and strawberry wrap around a depth of fresh earth and rose petals in this medium-bodied and well-integrated wine. As it reveals fully developed layers of fruit and nuanced texture, it sizzles in white pepper, a twist of intrigue that differentiates this wine.
Smells hot, tastes raw and sharp, with blackberry and cherry tea flavors that seem artificially sweetened. This is a pretty clumsy wine.
This easy-drinking blended red wine opens with offbeat aromas of banana, mixed fruit salad and sour cherry. With more time in the glass, those bright fruit aromas are slowly replaced by spice and almond flavors.
Straightforward cherry and raspberry aromas carry a floral accent. It feels zesty and tight, with plum, herb and tomato flavors, with a finish that shows a vanilla note. A fresh, simple wine at every turn.
The Barrel Select is given 26 months in 100% new oak, and it shows in both the nose and the mouth. Smoke and char are not accents here; they are the main event. The fruit flavors are simple cherry/berry, and thin out rather quickly in the finish.
The high toast aromas, typical of Chanson wines, can be off-putting. But get beyond the wood, which needs a couple more years to integrate, and the ripe fruit of 2005 gives this wine density and character. The yellow fruits, ripe cantaloupe melon flavor and sweet acidity will more than hold their own against the wood.
There is an unusual sensation of spritz in the mouth, though no hint of any CO2 can be seen in the glass. This is bone dry, stemmy and earthy, with the most prominent flavor.
Citric smelling, with lean red-berry scents and no shortage of tropical aromas, particularly pineapple. Solid in the mouth, with red berry flavors and mild chocolaty-oak accents.
There are some ripe notes here of black cherry and raspberry (2007 was a hot, dry vintage in Piedmont) but you'll also get territory-driven notes of wet earth and dried beef or bresaola. The mouthfeel is dry and firm thanks to the elegantly polished nature of the tannins.
This offers strong oak and smoke aromas, plus ripe black cherry, chocolate and plum flavors. Full body and firm tannins make it assertive. Not a cocktail wine, this needs to pair with some heavy meat.
Quite a good Chardonnay, but not without some problems. It's as rich as anything out there, with massive pineapple jam, crème brûlée and buttered toast flavors. The acidity feels slightly alien, especially on the finish.
Dark fruit, leather, tobacco and spice aromas lead the way on this elegantly structured red. On the palate, notes of cocoa, vanilla, anise and espresso accent a core of fleshy black cherry, while firm, fine-grained tannins provide support. A licorice note signals the close.
Full and rich, this wine brings out smooth apple and pear flavors that are sustained by hints of wood aging. It has a fresher side with citrus acidity giving the rounder textures a lift. Worth aging, it can be drunk from 2015.
This is a luminous and powerful Fiano di Avellino with a very elegant and linear quality that sets it apart. You'll get herbs, cantaloupe and fresh lime. It performs well in the mouth thanks to its thick, creamy texture and boosting alcohol. A Marc de Grazia selection, various American importers.
Spicy Asian pear dominates in this low-to-no-oak white, medium-bodied and jumping in savory thyme. Aromas of peaches also come into play, before this wine finishes crisp and clean.
This wine is soft and ripe, but seems to lack structure. Don't expect it to age.
A unique and rich nose of clove, beet juice, freshly turned earth and wet chalkboard lead this wine. It's soft and peppery on the palate at first, with raspberry fruit, strong spice and excellent acidity.
Chalk Line includes all five Bordeaux grapes along with 25% Syrah. The first sniff brings up generous red and purple fruit aromas and pretty, yet restrained, barrel toast. It's well-integrated with medium density and excellent balance.
Most of the higher-tier Grant Burge Shirazes this vintage were excellent, so maybe it's not such a surprise that this one is just good. There's a kirsch-ish aspect to the plummy nose, plus tangy oak. Oak and plum are reprised on the palate; a little rough on the tongue, and finishes short. Imported by Wilson Daniels Ltd.
Ribolla Gialla is a naturally creamy, soft variety, but this expression favors tonic soda aromas and tart lemon candy that help shape a racy and zesty impression overall.
Smells and tastes like an inexpensive Aussie Shiraz, with jammy raspberry and cherry flavors and a dry, peppery finish. The texture is a little syrupy and thick, but it's a good, easy wine.

This structured, elegant wine opens with aromas of violet, berry, tilled soil and a whiff of leather. The palate has nice depth, offering layers of black cherry, cinnamon, savory herb and tobacco. It's impeccably balanced with firm, polished tannins and fresh acidity. Already delicious, it will develop more complexity. Drink 2015–2025.
This is a medium-dry wine that has more spice than sweetness. It is warm and full in the mouth, and accented with a touch of pepper, brisk acidity and lychee flavors. The wine is rich and ready to drink. Screwcap.
Beguiling in cedar, black cherry and black tea, this inviting Cab is made by consulting winemaker Aaron Pott with 2% Petit Verdot blended in, noticeable in its dark, inky color. The tannins are well-managed, present but softened, a taste of dark chocolate and coffee subtly hinted at through the finish.
This brisk and refreshing wine never saw a splinter of oak, so what stars are the pure, ripe flavors of tropical and citrus fruits, lemongrass, honey and a hint of white pepper. The acidity gives it a keen, clean finish. This would be great with everything from roast chicken to Vietnamese food.
Fruity, rich and tannic, this wine has flavors of blackberry, molasses, dark chocolate, licorice, bacon, smoky oak and pepper. It's a dry, full-bodied effort that should provide pleasant drinking over the next six years.
An untamed style of wine, with wild-fruit and ever-so-slight citrus aromatics. It's got a nice full body to it, with some creaminess in the mouth. Proper acids and a good application of oak keep it balanced. Bridgeview has a knack for making well-priced Pinot Noir that's fruity, friendly and complex enough to satisfy those who know and love the grape. This is a perfect case in point.
Heavy oak and herbal berry aromas start this old vines Garnacha. Give it some breathing time. Grabby, sticky and a bit narrow in the mouth, this tastes of woody blueberry with herbal overtones. Minty oak and strong tannins push the finish. Drink through 2020.
This Cabernet Sauvignon blend is very young and ready to drink with its sweet fruit and forward, vanilla-laced flavors. It fades quickly, leaving a lingering impression of soda pop (root beer).
The sweetness got out of hand in this wine, which tastes like it has excessive residual sugar. There's a raspberry and white chocolate power bar flavor. That's delicious, of course, but consumers should know the wine isn't dry.
Earthy notes of underbrush, truffle, tilled soil and ripe plum lead the nose on this solid Vino Nobile. The straightforward palate offers crushed black cherry, raspberry, white pepper and a hint of licorice alongside fine-grained tannins. Enjoy through 2018.
Initially this smells horsey and a bit green, but with airing it improves. In the mouth, hard tannins and aggressiveness rule the show. Flavors of baked, meaty, toasty berry fruits finish smoky, chocolaty and savory, with a pinch of green herbs.
Far and away the freshest and most interesting of the three vintages submitted for review. The fruit retains more of its youthful gloss; it's riper and shows more cherry character, along with bright, spicy highlights. The tannins are proportionate and less earthy and herbal. This is no barn-burner, but it's a good quaffer.
This bone-dry wine made from 85% Arinto has crisp freshness and texture. It's lively with a strong mousse and lemon and green apple fruitiness. Sophisticated and wearing its bottle age well, it finishes with a toasty aftertaste. Drink now.
A little earthy, with plummy aromas accompanied by sun-dried tomato, rhubarb and hard spice notes. The flavors are along the same lines, with cherry tomato, coffee and spices. It's very dry, and finishes with a slightly dusty, tannic bite.
This gentle, ripe wine is immediately attractive. Ripe pear and peach are cut with acidity. Drink now.
Tasty and satisfying, especially for the price, with notes of plum flesh, strawberry and blueberry in the nose and mouth. Lean but so drinkable with soft mocha and pepper spice unfolding on the solid finish. Drink now.
Blackberry and eucalyptus aromas with a coffeelike accent set the stage for a full, smooth wine. Vanilla bolsters bright blackberry flavors on the palate, and fades into a substantial finish. Very impressive for an under-$20 Shiraz. Imported by Negociants USA. Inc.
This mature blend of Syrah, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Tempranillo smells stalky and herbal, with stewed berry notes and a whiff of coffee grinds. The palate is raw and rubbing, while horsey berry flavors suggest underripeness. A soupy, stewy tasting finish feels chunky and obtuse.
Very Pommard, very structured, this is a dense and dark wine that shows big black fruits over dry tannins. It's big, firm, muscular, a powerhouse of firmness and richness.
Edelzwicker is an Alsatian term meaning noble blend, and is applied to any blend of white wine grapes. Here it includes Gewürztraminer, Pinot Gris and Riesling. This white is substantial and fruit-driven more than floral in this new vintage. Apple, pear and nectarine flavors carry a light touch of mint. It's very refreshing, well balanced and distinctive.
Spicy, mushroomy and earthy, full of forest floor character, what the French would call sous bois. It's nicely textured as well, supple and round, just don't expect a fruit explosion. Imported by Station Imports Inc.
One of the few red dessert wines with obvious new-oak flavors, this wine smells smoky and toasty. It tastes sweet and black peppery, and is very full bodied.
Brambly and a bit green, with aromas of plum, basil and forest floor. This is one of the more tannic wines you'll encounter; the feel is like a jackhammer pounding away. But within that tannic vise there's adequate raisin, plum and beet-like flavors.
Spice and leaf aromas ride above a mildly ripe nose. Flavors of roasted plum, spice, wild herb and tomato finish well, with firm, slightly raw tannins. Drink this blend of 60% Garnacha, 30% Tempranillo and 10% Graciano through 2019.
This is a blend from Monterey and Santa Barbara counties. It's a dry, crisp, useful Pinot Noir. Fifty percent new French oak gives a smoky, charry overlay to the cherry, red currant and licorice flavors.
Barolo Mosconi drinks young at this stage but already paints a pretty picture of the 2005 vintage. The wine offers direct intensity and layered aromas of luscious chocolate and coffee with loads of spice, leather and tar on the finish. The tannins are still a bit aggressive, so give this wine time to age: Drink after 2018.
Round and softly fruity, this white Burgundy comes with a hint of vanilla. With its ripe apple, lime and yellow fruit flavors, it's instantly drinkable. The finish is touched by acidity.
A good show of restraint with ripeness, this wine by Mike Sinor conveys green olive, dark herbs, clove sticks, pencil lead, Kalamata olives and peppery raspberry on the nose. It's lithe and savory once sipped, with more black and purple olives, Bing cherry fruit at the core and a distinctive pencil-shaving minerality toward the finish.
Lightweight, with smooth red fruit and acidity, this is soft and round. The berry fruit neatly merges with the gentle tannins.
Made entirely with Sangiovese, this opens with delicate aromas of black cherry and clove that continue to the no-frills palate together with a hint of white pepper. Firm tannins provide support.
Big but flat, with soft aromas of baked plum and fall leaves. The palate is all brown sugar, caramel, chocolate and rich but hard to find black fruit, while the finish is sweet like milk chocolate and toffee. Decent wine but definitely soft and syrupy.
Shows a nice balance, with ripe black currant and cherry fruit flavors wrapped in smooth, supportive tannins, and a fruity but dry finish. This elegant Cab drinks well now, and should hold for a good 10 years.
One of the more evolved examples, Hamacher's 2000 Pinot Noir should be consumed over the next year or two, although it's possible other bottles may show differently (Hamacher felt there was something “off” with this bottle). Complex cherry, sous bois and mushroom notes finish on a drying note.
This is an attractive, ripe style of Pinot Gris. Off dry, it is aromatic, lightly spicy over crisper pear and yellow fruit flavors. It's ready to drink.
This is a ripe, plump style of Sauvignon Blanc, delivering ripe fig and melon aromas and flavors. It's not the crispest version you'll ever find, but makes up for that in its generosity of flavor. Drink now.
Soléna really ups their PG game with this latest vintage, a super rich, succulent effort that is packed to the core with fresh pear fruit flavors. Light touches of cinnamon, and a sense of sweetness from ripe fruit, not residual sugar, keep the flavors expanding through a lush and creamy finish.
A juicy wine certain to please those who opt for the hip label, this is quite showy on the nose, with densely packed blackberries, clove, caramel and vanilla elements. The rich palate is equally poppy and boisterous, with black cherry jam, allspice and nutmeg notes.
A very pale rosé, this blend of Grenache and Syrah is medium bodied, features hints of red berries to go along with barely ripe nectarines and finishes crisp and refreshing. Drink now.
This is a genuine, powerful wine that fully embodies the fundamental aromatic tenets of Amarone: cherry, chocolate and spice. You might pick up slight variations on this basic theme such as cherry liquor, dark fudge and powdered licorice. Ultimately, it is a very intense and extracted wine with a modern, supple approach and lively acidity on the finish.
Spicy and fresh aromas lead this elegant but accessible white from Florina. Tropical fruit flavors are round and layered but the wine has a good spice and mineral mix. A great wine for the table?lots of food-pairing options here.
This open and welcoming blend of Sauvignon Blanc, Sémillon and Assyrtiko starts off with pear and apple scents that glide easily into plump stone-fruit flavors. A bit of white-peppery spice kicks it up a notch on the finish.
89–91. Barrel sample. From the northern Médoc vineyard of Goulée, this spicy, cool wine has a touch of green as well as fresh fruit. It's textured with a salty, herbaceous feel.
This cuvée, named after a statue in the vineyards, is dark and dense. There is a strong chewy character to this wine which is obviously much too young to drink now. The dark fruits are surrounded by considerable tannic structure. It is powerful and concentrated, perhaps all too much. Drink from 2020.
Made from a field blend, this Port is rich and packed with fruit. The tannins and juicy black plums are balanced by prune, spice and a hint of wood aging. Drink this wine from now and until 2022.
The benchmark among fino-style Sherries is La Gitana. Simply put, it's a classic. Pour yourself a copita of this beauty and sip it while munching some olives, peanuts or pistachios. Shazzam! You're transported to a whitewashed village in Andalusia. Aromas of mushroom and yeast are just as they should be. And deep within are subtle flavors of marzipan and citrus. The long, salty, bone-dry finish cleanses the palate and primes your appetite for better things to come.
Herbal notes are intermingled with dark chocolate and blackberry to produce the intense, extracted nose on this southern Italian red wine. There's a touch of sourness on the close, backed by super tight tannins, that should relax with two or three more years of cellar aging.
This blend of 60% Grenache, 20% Syrah and 20% Counoise shows sharp aromas of pressed olallieberry, cola, uncracked peppercorns and dried oregano on the nose. A strong central line of smashed plum, fig and sweet berries arises on the sip, but with tons of herbal lift. It's a buoyant and well-rounded flavor profile, fruity but herbal.
Aromatic and drinking at its peak, this remains fresh, tart and tangy, with palate-penetrating boysenberry and blueberry fruit. Think Lemberger meets Pinot Noir and you have a sense of it, albeit with a slightly rustic edge.
This crisp, savory white offers layers of white peach, tart Granny Smith apple and lemon-lime flavors. It's vibrant and well balanced, with refreshing acidity. An almond note signals the close.
Delicate whiffs of blossom and peach introduce this dry, buoyantly fruity Riesling, full of sun-kissed apricot, tangerine and grapefruit flavors. Neatly balanced, it's juicy and approachable, but brightened by streaks of lime and a steely, tangy finish.
Almost as good as the '07, Guigal pared down the production of this wine by one-third to maintain its quality level. Pear and melon flavors are buttressed by weight and richness while still retaining freshness and a touch of spice on the finish.
Sangiovese, Merlot and some Cabernet Sauvignon are blended to create a bold and determined wine. Huge aromas of espresso bean, black fruit, tobacco and dark chocolate make for a meaty and dense bouquet. There's enormous depth on the palate, where the wine feels rich and softly velvety. It's a Tuscan blend of the highest caliber, so hold it for 10 years or more.
Floral soupy plum aromas come with notes of road tar, violet, lavender and grass. This has a jammy, saturated, chunky mouthfeel to go with plum and spiced-berry flavors. Exotic notes of cardamom and clove are key to a spicy finish. This is a blend of Monastrell, Tempranillo and Cabernet Sauvignon.
Tahbilk is proud owner of the largest Marsanne holdings in the world, with a reputation for making ageworthy examples. Perhaps this one just needs more time, then, as it comes across as nothing more than a nicely balanced, medium-bodied dry white with modest notes of pears and almonds.
This wine opens with an explosion of Granny Smith apples underlined by firm minerality. The honeyed palate shows nice grapefruit and lemon character. Medium, citrus finish. Best now, but will gain complexity over three to four years.
Pretty and pink, this light-bodied but nervy wine brims with white raspberry and pomegranate flavors and a texture that is crisp and mouth-cleansing. The balance between fruitiness and acidity is precise and appetizing, so it pays off sip after sip. It was made from Grenache, Mourvèdre, Roussanne and Grenache Blanc.
The wood element is what gives this wine some weight. The fruit by itself is on the edge of green, saved by the dollop of Merlot softness and the well-judged wood. A good effort for 2007.
Notes of toast and yeast characterize the bouquet of this elegant sparkling wine from northern Italy. This metodo classico bubbly is firm and tonic in the mouth with steely effervescence and lingering tones of dried fruit.
Though found in some Chardonnays, there's a heaviness to this wine, with its orange Muscat nose and syrupy flavors, that seems out of sync here. The wine seems to flop onto the palate and sit there, without much progression. Needs more acid and a lighter touch.
An enjoyable and quaffable wine that can be relied upon in spontaneous situations. Peach, ripe melon, lemon zest and a dash of herbs create an interesting ensemble. Solid and smooth in the mouth, and very food-friendly. Imported by Palm Bay Imports.
Very fruity aromas hint that this is a bright wine, its tannins shaded by the red and black berry flavors. The structure is integrated, showing ripe as well as fresh fruit with final flavors of chocolate.
A very distinctive nose of black currant, cinnamon, crushed herbs and chocolate cake give this Cabernet an alluring start. Flavors of red berries, pepper and spices follow. Soft tannins and an overall friendly character make this a good everyday choice.
The wood aging is still showing in the aroma of the wine. On the palate, the fruitiness of the blend of Antão Vaz, Arinto and Viognier comes across richly with flavors of apricots, green plums and pink grapefruit. This fruitiness is layered over the wood spice to give a creamy wine that will age. Drink from 2017.
Comprised of traditional Port varieties, this is a very dry, high-acid wine of a certain charm. With its silky texture and cherry and rose petal flavors, you might mistake it for a countrified Grenache. It finishes in a swirl of cloves, cinnamon and other dusty spices.
Sharp and focused, with fine-tuned varietal expression, this is flat out loaded with rich fruit flavors. Orange, lime, pineapple and pear can be found, all beautifully polished. It's ripe and precise without being bitter or hot, and a fine value as well.
This is Marimar's first Sonoma Coast Pinot, and the result is promising. The wine is more acidic and deeper than her estate Pinots, bringing to mind Hirsch Pinots. It's big, rich, complex and almost Syrah-like. A wine to watch.
This dark-tinted Carignan smells of licorice, lemony oak and loamy, candied cassis. In the mouth, this is rough and raw on the surface but jammy in the midpalate. A mix of ripe raisin, cassis and licorice flavors are herbal and peppery, while the tannins on the finish don't cease. At 15.5% abv, this is over the top and heady.
Tannic and savory, this is more in the house style than a reflection of any European Dolcetto you may have experienced. Dark fruits, espresso and astringent tannins comprise the palate, with those tannins overtaking the fruit as it fades at the finish.
A jumbled mix of aromas includes notes of rubber, berry fruits, plum, grass, fennel and oak. In the mouth, this is full and blocky. Rubbery flavors of plum and berry finish salty, savory and spicy, with unintegrated oak that stands out.
Dense layers of dark fruits—black plum, cassis and cherry—integrate with complex accents of black tea leaves, tanned hide and woody spice. Supporting tannins provide the palate a firm structure, framing the lush, concentrated black-fruit-driven flavor. Drinkable now, but it should age nicely though 2016.
Trinity county is just north of Mendocino, with a hot, inland climate. This wine advances the fine wine cause up there. It's a little soft, but juicy and dry, with ripe cherry, blackberry and cocoa flavors, and a complex note of sweet kid leather.
A very soft Riesling, missing the steeliness while gaining ripe white fruits and a fragrant, gentle character. It is attractively structured, though needs a year to age.
This wine is clean, good and tasty. It's not especially complex, but shows berry, cherry, spice and oak flavors that are wrapped in a soft, balanced package.
From Stillwater Creek vineyard, this 80/20 blend of Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon simply tastes young. The fruit is ripe enough, but superficial, with a lot of barrel flavors providing the weight and filling in with smoke, toast and coffee. Malbec has a very promising future in Washington State, and it's good to see young and talented wineries such as Tildio doing the exploration. Right now, this is just a pleasant table wine.
A solid Syrah, dry and full-bodied, but not quite up to the last three vintages. Although there are savory blackberry and currant flavors, there's also a tough mintiness, and the mouthfeel is a bit scoury. Drink soon.
Briny, cool-coast aromas of pinched plum and berry lead to a full-bodied palate bolstered by high acidity. Tart plum, cherry and herbal flavors finish crisp, short and basic. This is a good, standard Pinot Noir, nothing more or less.
A rose garden's worth of aromas lift out of the glass in this hearty, full-bodied red, the peppery tannins somewhat grippy on the palate before settling down. Blackberry punches through on the palate, given additional color and lift from the 5% Petit Verdot.
A basic, serviceable Pinot Noir, Vinterra's 2010 combines varietally correct notes of cherry, leather and earth. The medium-weight palate and supple tannins stay true to the variety as well.
Softly lush, a nice, fruit-forward Cabernet to drink now. Shows well-ripened blackberry and black currant flavors, finished with a touch of smoky oak. Good price for a Stags Leap Cab.
This attractively priced Gigondas is a solid example, boasting traditional notes of leather and spiced meat. It's supple and slightly warm, with modest cherry fruit coated with a dusting of dry red earth. Clove and metallic notes on the finish suggest early consumption is the prudent option.
There is a caramel edge to this wine showing the wood-aging flavors. Luckily the fruit is all there as well, giving a balanced future to this structured wine. With plenty of tannins and juicy acidity combined, it will be a fine wine from 2019.
91—93 Barrel sample. A big wine in all senses – big fruit, bit spice from the wood, but tannins. They all hang together, and come up with elegance as well as power.
The colorless appearance of this wine extends to its very delicate and dilute style. Marshmallow, mango, coconut water and orange blossom carry to the palate, with a hint of licorice and grassiness on the finish.
This is a spicy, fresh wine with cinnamon alongside fragrant acidity. It's crisply fruity, full of balanced acidity and deliciously aromatic. With its ripe apricot flavors, this wine is ready to drink.
Apricot and oak aromas make for a smoky, slightly heavy bouquet. The wine keeps that weightiness as it passes from nectarine to citrus to tropical fruits. Long on the finish, with integrity. But it's also a bit citric in the center. “Pulpy” is another descriptor.
The aromas are vibrant, with notes of pear, honeysuckle and peach. The palate is full flavored, dry as promised, with a zing of tart acidity that stitches it all together. It's an outstanding value that shows a beautiful sense of balance.
Cocoa and cherry carry a nose that features some green pepper and barnyard. Mild berries on the palate, with a leafy-earthy quality. Doesn't have the stuffing of many Napa Cabs, and in that sense it sports Bordeaux-like tendencies. For a lightweight rendition, give it a try.
This stylishly labeled wine by Adam Lazarre and Christian Tietje shows salted apples, lime blossoms and white flowers on the nose. The energetic palate offers just-cut green pears at first, then opens into a touch of vanilla. It tightens back down on green apple peels before ending with vanilla cream. The wine delivers a full experience.
A barrel-aged Alvarinho, but one that is so delicately toasty that the fruit is what this ripe generous wine is all about. It is rich with citrus and pear flavors, zesty and tangy while also having room for a round ripe aftertaste. This is an impressive wine, ready to drink now.
Although the fine mountain site straddles both Napa and Sonoma, this wine's fruit is all Sonoma, the bulk of it Cabernet Franc, with 17% Cabernet Sauvignon. Dried cranberry shows on the nose and palate, followed by chalky tannins and a refined use of oak, finishing in a bite of currant and cherry. Enjoy through 2017.
An extreme wine from an extremely cool site in an extremely cool vintage, Handley's estate Chardonnay is intriguingly tart, crisp and low in alcohol, yet textured and unique. Sip it on its own or pair with buttery shellfish or goat cheese on crackers.
This is a thick, masculine Amarone with dense extraction and soda- like qualities of root beer, smoked bacon, A1 Steak Sauce and beef jerky. It delivers enormous power and concentration followed by a thick, meaty feel.
This has enormously high alcohol, but the fruit is curiously thin, with some unripeness. The amount of new oak doesn't seem to help.
Coming from Two Blondes Vineyard, aromas of baking spice, barrel spice, herb, mesquite and cherry are followed by elegant smooth-feeling fruit flavors. Light bacon notes provide unusual accents. It's intriguing, though the variety is hard to find.
This two-acre premier cru situated north of Beaune city gives smooth and rich wines. This bottling shows the acidity of the vintage while also having a full, round character, ripe with strawberries and crisp with acidity. The wine needs more time, so drink from 2019.
Fans of fruit-forward wines will love this Cab Franc for its explosion of cherries, blackberries and blueberries. The flavors go on and on. Sweet in fruit, yet it finishes bone dry. Not an ager, but a beauty with salty pork or duck dishes.
Tight-grained oak aromas give off qualities of tobacco and spice that are met with a touch of raspberry. Fruity, it fits the equation of classic Rioja: It delivers light strawberry, raspberry, plum and vanilla flavors on a fresh, acid-driven frame.
Planted in 1979, the Wädenswil block brings raspberry, cherry and cola flavors together into a nicely textured wine with a wide streak of vanilla. Round and forward, it gently resolves into a balanced finish with light highlights of herb, nutmeg and coffee.
This lightweight, tart-cherry flavored wine displays some coffee and game notes on the nose. The aromas and flavors are correct, but it's a bit hollow. It lacks the body (and shows more sourness) that most enthusiasts would want from an inexpensive quaff.
Firm and substantial on the palate, this is a complex Pinot, the red cherry fruit juicy and inviting and the wine layered in Chinese five-spice. Light in texture and weight the wine still offers a sense of place and gravitas.
Heavily toasted, with buttery aromas of peach, lemon and pineapple. Very sweet on the palate, with honey, caramel, coconut and baked-apple flavors. What may be too sweet and sickly for some could trigger happiness for others. Not a unanimous choice among our panel.
Although the nose on this medium-bodied Romanian blend of Pinot Noir, Merlot and Feteasca Neagra is pretty with ripe, black plums, vanilla and a hint of cashew nuts, it takes some airing out for the charred oak flavors to settle, allowing red plum and coffee grind notes to appear on the palate. Gripping tannins and high acidity give this wine a puckery astringency, but it's not bad for the bargain price.
Opens with bright, tart fruit displaying berry, cherry and rhubarb qualities. This north-country candidate has good scale and mouthfeel. Berry, earth and leather flavors, smooth dry tannins, and a dusty earth note on the finish close out this medium-weight and balanced offering. Drink now through 2008.
From a longtime producer of Alexander Valley Cabs, another in a series of successful wines. Stays true to its terroir, a soft wine with melted tannins and round, ripe fruity flavors. Instantly appealing, and versatile at the table.
Pure Cabernet Sauvignon, sourced from Gamache, Stillwater Creek and Red Mountain vineyards. Berry, cherry and plum fruit flavors fill the mouth, gaining strength and detail as they broaden out across the palate. Highlights of loam and tobacco fill in the finish, with just a slight suggestion of alcohol burn.
This beautiful expression of Merlot from Amarone producer Zenato exhibits delicate nuances of small berry fruit, bramble and spice. The wine is elegant and feminine with excellent intensity and a soft, plush texture.
The Domaine de Courcel owns a large part of the heart of the Epenots vineyard, within the walls of a clos. This is a wine with a solid structure, cherry and spice flavors, an elegant feel to go with the ripe berry fruits. It is very balanced, the tannins a great support to the fruit.
Powerful, ripe wine with black fruits and a great swathe of dark tannins. The flavors of berries, black plums, black figs and sage are echoed by the warm, herbal and wild flower aromas. This is a big wine, which needs at least a year to age.
A bit softer and more approachable than many Australian Rieslings, but it still bears a familial resemblance to Wakefield's Clare Valley Riesling, with hints of crushed stone or chalk and tangerine-citrus notes. Drink now.
This is a spicy wine, with toasty wood flavors. Happily the fruit is also there, spreading its juicy acidity over the tannins. Let this wine fill out over the next few months and it will be ready to drink from 2017.
An expression of Riesling Renano grapes, Il Torrione has a saturated golden color and opens with aromas of apricot, lemon zest, yellow rose and caramel butterscotch. It shows a smooth, ripe mouthfeel with a touch of bitter almond on the close.
Fleshy, slightly overripe aromas of yellow peach and nectarine extend from nose to finish on this semi-sweet Riesling. It's crisp and refreshing with tangerine acidity, but a dusty, pollen note distracts on the finish.
For what is essentially a second wine, generally blended from the estate's younger vines, this is a solid effort in a not-so-easy vintage. Vanilla and cinnamon from barrel-aging play a role hedre, but there's also plenty of juicy, plum-tinged fruit. There's ample body and texture, capped off by supple tannins and a lingering finish. Drink now–2022.
Tastes a bit remote and hard now, with a steely minerality that accentuates the acidity, and even boosts the tannins. Underneath that are clean, vibrant pineapple, Meyer lemon, golden apricot and lime flavors. This is one of the rare California Chardonnays that should improve with some age. Hold for 3–4 years, maybe even longer.
Relatively light in body, with pungent overtones of boxwood and asparagus. This is a bit on the green side of the spectrum, only partially balanced by citrusy fruit.
This varietal Trepat is fresh and dainty on the nose, with strawberry aromas. A direct, pure, juicy palate is elegant, and, like the nose, this tastes of red fruits, raspberry and cherry included. A clean finish glides away with grace and length. Drink now.
Creamy and sweet on the bouquet, with pear and apple aromas and toasty oak that includes the scent of cinnamon. Feels weighty, maybe a bit mealy, with matching flavors of melon and citrus that are sweet and pithy. Modest on the finish, it's pleasant as a whole.
This is a tannic, hard-edged Cabernet, sourced from the Artz vineyard on Red Mountain. The heavy-set tannins surround slightly green flavors of herb, stem and black olive, along with dark and earthy black fruits.
Golden in color, this is a creamy voluptuous white wine, fermented and aged entirely in new French oak. Melon, spicy nutmeg and fig build flavor around a core of thick texture and concentration, finishing in buttery toast.
A taut, nervy, mineral-driven wine, this has intense citrus and grapefruit flavors, lemon grass spice and just the merest hint of wood. It's the structure that gives this impressive wine such power, and a steely edge that will need at least 6–10 years.
Fresh and colorful, with black cherry, cassis, sweet oak and coffee aromas. Feels big and grabby, with big tannins supporting blackberry and olive flavors. Sort of a rough ride but generous with the baked flavors and fruit content.

This spicy 100% Merlot wine has tangy black fruits as well as dense texture. It is ripe and very juicy, with intense acidity. It needs to relax (25% new oak barrels; 25% one to two years, the rest in tanks), so drink from 2017.
Elvio Cogno's Cascina Nuova Barolo is the darling of the 2006 vintage and Ravera, a more austere and reserved expression, is still something of an awkward teenager at this point. Mature berry tones and candied fruit come forward as do notes of cinnamon and Graham cracker. The finish is smooth and silky.
This blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot is vinified in steel and bottle aged. It's young and fresh, boasting bright red cherry and raspberry sensations along with notes of freshly tilled earth.
Here's a cheerful Brunello with offbeat aromas of candied fruit, cherry liqueur and white licorice. It's a ripe and chewy wine (but not exaggeratedly so) with mature aromas of blackberry and sticky Indian spice. Fresh acidity makes the wine pop in the mouth, while releasing bursting berry overtones.
Overripe, jammy fruit aromas and flavors spoil this wine. It's oddly balanced: soft on the one hand and tough on the other.

Made from 56% Pinot Noir and 44% Chardonnay and given multiple extra years in bottle, this wine offers a substantial body weight within crisp well-defined acidity. Apple skin, bread dough and a note of hazelnut combine to afford warm welcoming flavor. Zero sugar is added.
This wine offers a lot of fruit, with subtle background notes of leather, wet earth and prune. It's a fresh, easydrinking selection.
Lovely notions of both ripe and green pear rise from the glass. There also is a more savory edge reminiscent of moss and yeast. This comes out even more on the fresh concentrated palate with a lovely salty peppery nuance that makes this very moreish and thrilling. The flavors, amply supported by zesty citrus, just last.
This wine is overwhelmingly smoky in char and bacon flavor, with a side note of herbal mint. Extracted, the oak is intrusive.
Beautiful pale onion skin color, with a light aroma of strawberries. These simple initial attributes mask a much more complex wine. The fruit flavors are blended in with toast, with some wood and fresh, lifting acidity. A serious rosé.
A little oaky and leathery at first, but as a whole this wine sings a nice song. The palate is firm and structured, with a lot of forward oak as well as juicy wild blackberry flavors. Lightly roasted and salinic on the finish, with length.
This dessert wine is sweet in honeyed orange, mango and pear flavors. It's simple, soft and easy to drink.

Acacia flower, almond and yellow apple aromas carry through to the lean, simple palate along with a confectionery note. Pour this at informal get-togethers.

Rich and firm, with great concentration, this wine is powered by botrytis, honey and the ripest yellow fruit and bitter orange flavors. It promises a great future, with power and richness balanced by acidity. Drink from 2023.
This blended white—a sweetish mix of Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Gewürztraminer and Riesling—has a honeyed character that suggests that at least some of the grapes may have been touched with botrytis. Regardless, look for that sugary, honeyed flavor to dominate.

Winemaker: Etienne le Riche. Pleasantly herbal tones of fynbos, mint, licorice root and violet grace the black cherry and boysenberry fruit core of this wine. The medium-weight mouthfeel offers gripping but not overbearing tannins, with ripe black-fruit tones that flesh out the palate. Final notes of bittersweet cocoa, wood spice and a touch of tobacco linger long on the close. It's mature enough to enjoy now, though it should continue to age well through 2021.
The estate wine of Corte de Cima is rich, soft, smooth. The fruit feels weighty, and misses out on freshness. But the opulent, jammy black fruit flavors and the soft spices are certainly attractive.
Seven Hills is a favored vineyard, and this is a step up from L'Ecole's Walla Walla and Columbia Merlots. There's more fruit, more concentration, more firm flesh, and the wine has an aura of power about it. Yet there's finesse as well, in the soft, spicy nose, and in the smooth, seamless way the wine fills the mouth with ripe flavor.
This wine is lush with blackberry jam and oak flavors, but high alcohol gives the finish a chili pepper heat.

Brings a welcome dryness and crisp structure to this Viognier. Tastes almost like Sauvignon Blanc, with orange and lime flavors and a bright, clean finish. Recommends itself as a good, alternative white wine.
Smooth and appealing, with ample fresh citrus flavors and a supple mouthfeel, this isn't so assertive that it gets in the way of the conversation or the food. Sourcing good quality grapes from non-premier regions keeps the price down.
Crisp pears and apples abound in this light-bodied dry Riesling. It's delicate in concentration but pleasantly lemony. The wine finishes briskly but freshly.
A compelling mix, with bright, vivacious fruit flavors running from apple to pear, peach to papaya. The influence of barrels is felt more than tasted, but it does add a whisper of toast to the finish. Lively and fresh, this is a great wine for richer seafood.
The Grand Estates is CC's midpriced offering, and the Chardonnay sees plenty of oak and sur-lie aging. Rich, toasted-nut aromas underscore firm apple and pear fruit. The custardy texture is a treat. Best Buy.

Here is a subtle, delicate style that emphasizes cherry cola, apple, root beer, nutty-green aromas such as dried chopped herbs or tea leaf, with currant berry and dried prunes. The fruit tastes very ripe in the mouth and this sensation is underlined by the wine's natural succulence and chewy consistency.
Dry and acidic, this has cherry flavors with a boiled asparagus edge. Drink up.
A touch sweet and syrupy, with a hint of molasses and raisin on the nose. The mouth deals big cassis, raspberry and cherry flavors, while the solid finish offers chocolate and a whiff of toast. Yourthful and forward; drink now and enjoy. Imported by Morande USA.
An interesting wine that depends on the right food matching to succeed. It's dryish to honeyed, and enormously ripe and fruity, with apricot, nectarine, pineapple, jasmine, honeysuckle and all kinds of Asian spice flavors. Calls for complex dishes, such as lake fish or chicken and a savory chutney.
Lots of richness for the price in this Chardonnay. Shows pineapple custard, lemon meringue pie, vanilla cream and caramel flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. Easy to find, with 9,000 cases produced.
With residual sugar of 11.5%, this is a very sweet wine, concentrated in apricot, lime and pineapple sorbet flavors, and with the high acidity needed for balance. It's a lusciously clean dessert wine.
Delicious aromas cover the entire range of the strawberry experience, from the scents of a blossoming strawberry field to frozen berries macerated into a syrup.

Imagine mint-wrapped berries on a fresh-cut plank of oak.
Kyklos offers aromas of vanilla, cherry, menthol and tobacco. On the palate, dried cherry fruit, spicebox and cedar give it a refined edge. The finish is touched with smoke and pepper.
Gentle lemon-peel freshness spells summer wine with the first whiff. The slender palate also continues on a friendly, superclean and superfresh lemon theme with just a very slight hint of fizz. Refreshment personified.
Heavy and globular on the nose, then mulchy, salinic and disjointed for the rest of the ride. Awkward and lemony feeling, with herbal berry flavors, tartness and just not much Pinot pizzazz. A jumbled wine that does not shine.
A light-hearted Crémant from northern Burgundy that has fresh apples and plenty of citrus. It's crisp and very fruity, lightly textured, the ideal apéritif-style sparkling wine. Drink now.
Toasty oak and vanilla aromas are draped heavily over blueberry and blackberry notes. Staunch, rubbery tannins and bold acidity make for a high-toned flavor profile of herbs, black fruit and briny salt. A long, oaky, herbal finish is silky and lusty.
There's an intensely rustic earthiness to this wine, complemented by white pepper and nutmeg. Medium bodied, it also offers sizzling acidity and tart red cherry. Lithe, it builds toward a robust, ripe end. Cellar through 2017–2020 or give it a few swirls before enjoying.
Yeast and citrus, chervil and white pepper meet on the nose. The palate blends a streak of pure citrus into all of this and lends sharp aromatic focus to the spicy, almost salty core. This is taut and toned, linear and long without a spare ounce of fat. Exciting and racy.
Aromatically, this wine takes some time to open, but in taste it's structured, pretty and very floral, with smooth lines of cherry and red raspberry that defy its high alcohol level. Made by Renwood Winery in Amador County, it's a very good value.
90-92 Barrel sample. This poised wine has attractive layers of clean, fresh lemon and honey flavors. There are some light wood nuances, lively acidity and dryness from botrytis. A finely balanced wine.

Seems mature and ready to drink now, with earth and mushroom flavors layered over black cherries and finishing with a touch of anise. An easy-drinking Pinot that's not heavy or extracted yet displays complexity and balance.

Brambly and spicy on the nose, with dry plum and raspberry aromas. The palate is tight and acidic for Malbec, so the plum and red berry flavors walk a thin line and come across juicy and chiseled. Turns herbal and lightly oaky with time.
High alcohol makes this wine seem hot. It's also very dry, and rich, oily foods will coax out its sweet berry essence.

The wine is still austere, with dry toastiness. Black fruits emerge from the structure, showing a severe character although one with potential. It will develop into a powerful wine, solid and firm.
This creamy, lush wine expresses orange and tangerine fruit mostly, with slight cherry and strawberry accents. High-toned acidity lifts the riper, plush mouthfeel.
Smoky and earthy smelling, with aromas of tobacco, subtle spice and dried cherry. This feels tight, with more acidity than body at this point in its evolution. Flavors of dried raspberry, plum, earth and brown sugar are solid and classic. Drink now through 2013.
Oak can be a wine's worst enemy, and this is a case in point. It smells like fennel, salami and root beer, and that's the best part. In the mouth, it's cloying in feel and the flavors are all hickory, clove, resin and forced spice. A wood-dominated wine with no fruit character.
Off the rack refers to the fact that the grapes for this dessert wine have been partially dried to concentrate the sugars, resulting in a moderately sweet (80g/L) wine with flavors of golden raisin and mango, a hint of sweet corn and a trace of bitterness on the finish.
An extremely pungent florality hits the nose on this sweeter bottling, with orange blossoms, strong white flowers and a quinine character. The palate is brightly sweet but far from overly done, with perfumed night jasmine mixing into more orange-blossom elements. Perhaps this wine is an acquired taste, but it's clean and crisp.
This is the priciest Cab Ca' Momi has released in years, but it's also the best. It's soft, complex and delicious in black currants, chocolate and oak, with wonderfully smooth tannins, and just enough acidity for balance. It's clearly decadent for drinking now through 2020. Beyond that, all bets are off.
Raw aromas of tomato, spice, herbs and pie cherry accurately announce a pointy, lean, scouring palate. This Garnacha from a cool vintage is dominated by red plum, tart cherry and raspberry flavors that finish short and punchy.
An earthy, leathery aroma and flavor dominate this light-bodied, smooth-textured wine. It brings on modest plum, tea and forest-floor flavors to broaden its appeal on the palate.
The soapy, flowery nose is not uncommon for this variety. The palate, meanwhile, is pointed and direct, with extracted citrus and white-grape flavors. Similar citric sharpness carries onto the finish.
This wine shows some maturity, with toast flavors coming through the creamy mousse. White stone fruit and streaks of citrus give a fresher end to this well-balanced wine.
If the label is to be believed, this pure Merlot, from a relatively cool site in a relatively cool year, tops 16% alcohol. The flavors reflect that; a thick mix of tar, smoke, asphalt, espresso and coffee grounds. Buried in there is some black cherry fruit, but it is definitely the barrel flavors and the alcohol that dominate.
Raw and common, with excessively sweet, jammy cherry-berry flavors and a bizarre streak of acidity that tastes like it came from a box.

89-91 Barrel sample. Minty aromas announce a smooth, polished wine, where the new wood is important, although well-integrated with the fruit. The structure is ripe, soft, attractive.
This Syrah boasts of cherry-vanilla, blackberry and black plum aromas and sour cherry and blackberry flavors. The tannins are nicely round, and the finish is pleasantly acidic.
If Nuits-Saint-Georges has a gentler side when young (as a contrast to the normal firm tannins), this wine shows it. The tannins are certainly here, but the ripe fruit shines through more than balances that dryness. Fresh strawberries and red plums round this off.
Supple and silky, this expressive, seductive wine offers ripe plum and cherry fruit matched to polished tannins. It's finished with tasty barrel flavors of coconut, butter pecan and toast, and it is thoroughly, irresistibly delicious.
A purple tint and aromas of black fruits, graphite, toast and minerally crispness set the bar high, but in the mouth and on the palate things are less impressive. There's a raw, acidic bite despite oaky creaminess, while flavors of wild berry and herbs finish a bit green.
Big and bold, this opens with aromas of baked plum, blue flowers and sweet baking spice. The robust, chewy palate doles out fleshy black cherry, espresso, clove and licorice alongside the warmth of evident alcohol. Solid but velvety tannins support the ripe fruit flavors. Drink 2016–2021.
Its presentation and dark bottle suggest a premium cuvée, borne out by the ripe character of this toasty wine. Produced from old vines in good years, this is a wine that could well be aged. Creamy apple purée flavors and rounded fruits add to the richness.
A rich, polished Cabernet. Doesn't taste particularly Oakville-like, due to extreme ripeness, softness, high alcohol and refined tannins that could come from anywhere, but it's well crafted and delicious. Offers waves of blackberries, black currants, chocolate and cedar. Now–2013.
A lovely golden color invites with this rich dessert wine from Samos. Lemon, honey, spice and flower aromas lead into smooth, balanced flavors of cinnamon, orange and honey, finishing off with a spicy spin. Acidity keeps the wine from being too heavy. A delicious solo sip, but pair with cheeses and desserts for added appeal.
Blackberry jam aromas, fresh, ripe jammy fruits, backed with sweet jelly and only lightly touched by spirit. A sweet, soft style, very easy.
Firm and dotted heavily with olive and herb, it's streaked with chocolate and graphite—a medium-long blend with a core of cassis fruit. Just a hint of plastic marks the finish.
From Green Valley, the coolest part of the appellation, a wine with the most wonderful opening scents of ripe pears and the smoky perfume of oak. Perfectly delicious in the mouth, with pronounced pear flavors and a sleek note of minerality. A touch of lees adds a creamy texture but doesn't overwhelm. As opulent and lush as this wine is, it's delicate and elegant. Editors' Choice.
This tasty bottle does not push for maximum ripeness, settling comfortably into a ripe-enough mix of apples, pears and nectarines. There's a dusting of cinnamon and even a little hint of brown sugar, though the wine is definitely finished dry. The balance holds true through a medium-long finish.
The name refers to Shafer discontinuing this wine, which is 92% Sangiovese, with the balance Cabernet. Sangiovese, it seems, doesn't sell. What a pity, because it's one of the best super Tuscan wines in California. The '03 is extraordinarily rich and complex, a fruit-forward wine but no bomb. It's controlled in every respect. Some of us will miss it.
A very pretty pale-copper color with a tinge of pink, this wine offers delicate, nuanced aromas of orange peel and mineral. The palate has a lightly creamy feel, showing a lot of freshness and tension.
This exciting Brut Prosecco shows a very floral and fruity bouquet followed by a crisp, drying mouthfeel. The high quality of the aromas is what sets this wine apart from the competition.

Grapefruit, melon, lime and match stick aromas give this Rueda a solid opening. The palate is fruity and a bit green and phenolic, with flavors of green melon, grass, cucumber and tangerine pith. Simple and clean on the finish.
Acidic, refreshing, very dry and very citrusy. Offers bright citrus, mineral and melon aromas, along with lemon and grapefruit flavors. A good bet if seafood is on the menu, or if the temperature outside is soaring.
Better known for Cabernet Sauvignon, Charles Krug has a good track record for Merlot, too, and their '04 is quite a rich wine. Dry and balanced, it offers a wealth of black cherry, black currant and mocha flavors, and is soft and lingering on the finish.
This is winemaker Ross Cobb's own family project, from extremely cool sites along the Sonoma Coast, including the family's own Coastlands vineyard. Here, with Rice-Spivak, he skirts the edge of ripeness, producing a light, bright wine that's at first hard to penetrate. Faint notes of tart cherry and pomegranate weave through like a fog, a seasoning of allspice on the finish.
There's a bit of a green bean streak running through this Cabernet from Woodward Canyon's second label, Nelms Road. Herbal red fruits have a clear earthy element, but it's a good bottle for a cold night and a warm stew.
This is a softly perfumed wine that has spice as well as ripe apple and pear flavors. Gently textured, it hints at tropical fruits balanced out with fine acidity. This is an attractive wine for drinking now.
A fine wine to drink now, this has the dryness that suggests pairing it with goat cheese. It has rich flavors of gooseberries, limes and vanilla, with a little smokiness from the oak.
Ripe Golden Pearmain apples and juicy, red-cheeked Comice pears are infinitely inviting on the nose, the fullish palate is more restrained and toned, fresh and zippy, channeling richness into concentrated length with a wonderfully lip-smacking, delicious finish.
Dark cherry, vanilla and a quiet streak of smoke permeate the personality of this well-made light-bodied wine that's soft and supple on the palate. Raspberry and cherry flavors further define its bright fruit-forwardness and sense of freshness, with a touch of grip on the finish.
Made from 50% Merlot with smaller amounts of Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Sauvignon, in that order, this reserve-level wine is thick in herb, cedar and pencil lead, classical in some ways, thick in chewy tannins otherwise. It finishes in a swirl of chocolate and caramel.
Quite a nice Chardonnay at a great price. It's rich and creamy and plump, with deliciously ripe flavors of pineapples, Asian pears, buttered cinnamon toast and vanilla. The richness is balanced by crisp acidity and a firm minerality.
Fruity wine, wild strawberry flavors that are cut through with juicy acidity. Touches of wood support the soft, ripe tannins of this structured, generous wine. Age for 3–4 years.
Apropos of the winery name, this wine has a beautiful oak blanket wrapped around its cherry and raspberry flavors. Clove, cinnamnon and cedar aromas lead to mulled-wine characteristics on the palate. It's a very perfumed and attractive wine for oak lovers.
Very ripe and extracted, almost jammy, with primary fruit flavors of blackberries, black cherries, red plums, currants, dark chocolate and spices. Delicious and noble, but kind of immature. Give it 4–6 years to soften and integrate, and it could develop even longer.
Intense fruitiness along with touches of mint and baking spices make this full-bodied wine impressive as well as complex and layered. The vivid, ripe strawberry and blackberry components are well balanced by firm tannins and a light oak coating.
This is MLG's entry-level Shiraz, but it's no slouch. Plum and blackberry fruit, hints of black olive and espresso, decent weight and dusty tannins provide plenty of bang for the buck. Drink now–2020.
This Mourvèdre/Grenache/Petite Sirah blend offers appealing aromas and flavors of spicy berry and smoke, with good structure and length. The smoky character borders on excessive, though, so pair it with some grilled, spicy ribs or kebabs for the best experience.
Dry and smoothly tannic, this will have wide appeal, both to novices and even experts who will appreciate its complexity. With black cherry and cola flavors, it has a nice jacket of oak that brings a smoky richness to the fruit. Drink now–2013.
Featuring Cabernet, Sangiovese, and Merlot, this New World red is big and powerful, with beautiful aromas of berry fruit, smoke, orange rind and spice.

Structure goes with red berry fruits in this light, crisp wine. It has a tendency to a tight texture and lean tannins. Ready to drink.

Rich and silky, this wine is full of very soft, sweet fruit. It has the texture of treacle, dense but without any sense of tannins. The dusty, superripe fruit (14.5% alcohol) makes it very enticing, but the structure and the acidity seem to have disappeared. Not imported.
Deliciously biscuity on the nose with hints of candied orange peel, this structured blanc de blanc balances a soft biscotti sweetness with delightfully high acidity and a creamy, gentle froth. Brisk, lemony finish.
92-94 Dense and concentrated, a powerful wine packed with ripe berry fruits, hugely ripe and opulent.

Black fruit and cherry leads on this balanced red. Flavors of black pepper, black currant and plum on the palate are round but not overbearing. A good daily red to pair with pastas, stews and meat dishes.
Napa brings classic elegance, Amador a lusty exuberance, to this very fine Zinfandel. The fruit is extraordinarily lush, with ripe blackberry jam, cherry pie filling, cassis-laced chocolate candies and peppery spices, and very little briar or bramble. This is great California Zinfandel.
A Barolo superstar on the rise—keep a close watch on the wines of Gianni Gagliardo and family. This expression from the prized Cannubi cru offers impressive intensity and personality with enticing aromas of black fruit, cola, root beer, cured beef, cedar and white truffle. The wine is ethereal and elegant but the tannic touch is firm enough to promise a long cellar future ahead.
Château des Jacques, owned by Burgundy producer Louis Jadot, makes serious wines, such as this Morgon. It's powerful and rich, full of solid black cherry flavors and a strongly mineral structure from granite soil. It's a complex wine that needs to age, so drink from 2017.
Pretty fragrances include white flowers and green apple. The fresh, linear palate offers pear and Granny Smith apple with a hint of lemon zest. Pair with light pasta dishes or sip as an apéritif.
The yellow apple, melon and spice aromas are bright and inviting. The palate is fresh and clean, with broad, vibrant flavors playing nicely against a tart finish.

A blend of Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Gamay, this is a firmly dry, tannic wine. Its acidity, black plum skin flavors and smoky, herbal undernote give attractive complexity. A great food wine.

The candied red-fruit aroma is soft yet snappy. It tastes briny and citrusy before ending with a persistent peppery bitterness and lively acidity.
Minty-grassy top aromas indicate that the wine, while endowed with decent berry character, has an herbal side as well. In the mouth, it's hard, lean and compact, with tart cherry/plum flavors and a quick finish. Basic with a touch of sourness.
Aromas of dark berry, graphite, forest floor and grilled herb mingle in the glass. The savory palate offers ripe black cherry, grilled herb, vanilla, licorice and a gamy note alongside a firm, tannic backbone. Drink after 2018.
Full of warm fruit and light spice, this generous wine is rich with yellow fruits balanced by bright acidity and vanilla. The rounded texture and ripe fruit mean the wine is very ready to drink.
Quite dark in color, with a weird gold-orange hue, but tastes clean and zesty. French oak barrel aging gives a vanilla, buttered-toast edge to the apricot, papaya, orange and honeysuckle flavors. Ready now as an exotic alternative to a barrel-fermented Chardonnay.
Made entirely with Cabernet Sauvignon, this has a subdued nose, eventually revealing aromas of black-skinned fruit and baking spice. The robust palate offers French oak, vanilla and a hint of cedar alongside rounded tannins.
Violet, dark-skinned berry and chopped herb aromas lift out of the glass. The lean firm palate offers dried sour cherry and a hint of spice but not much fruit richness while bracing, drying tannins leave an astringent finish.
A mainstream, commercial style that blends green peppers and green peas with a sweet midpalate. Not overly aggressive or pungent, just a soft, lightly sweet sipper.
Fresh, crisp apple and pear are touched with delicate swathes of cream and oyster shell on this elegant, impeccably balanced Chardonnay. The palate is brisk with lemon and lime acidity, but builds in richness and texture on the finish. A remarkable value at $13.
One of the best sparkling reds I've had in a long while, the current-release Vixen is 77% Shiraz, 15% Cabernet Sauvignon and 8% Cabernet Franc. Black cherries, vanilla and mint mingle easily on the nose an palate, with is rich but rather dry. It's ready to drink now.
Compared to Felsina's other Riserva from the same vintage, Rancia offers more evident use of oak and is shaped by natural aromas of bright berry and supple notes of vanilla and spice. There's also an earthy tone that recalls the beautiful territory of Castelnuovo Berardenga. It is succulent and sophisticated and has a long menthol-driven finish.
This remarkably balanced semi-dry wine is intensely aromatic, with scents of preserved yellow peaches, saffron and spice. Juicy and ripe in stone fruit flavor, it's unabashedly forward, yet piercing acidity and delicate mineral tones lend elegance and style. Finishes with a lingering kiss of honey.
A fine complement to the Forgeron Late Harvest Sémillon, this is equally sweet (9.5%) but fortified to just under 18% alcohol. It's reminiscent of Benedictine & Brandy – orange liqueur with some alcohol power. Nice focus and balance.
This dark, somewhat volatile reserve wine from the Hogue Cellars is trying to push the envelope, with mixed success. Small amounts of Syrah, Malbec and Cabernet seem to have pumped up the color and the tannins, without adding much in the way of fruit. Right now it's quite tight, and long airing does not improve it. If another year or two in bottle can work some magic, and soften up the tannins, it could turn a corner into a fine, medium-bodied Bordeaux-style wine.
With layers upon layers of spicy saffron, peach, honey and caramel to be enjoyed on the nose alone, this heady botrytized Riesling is pure hedonism. The sweet-tart palate is deft and spry yet deeply lusciously penetrating in flavor. Spine-tingling acidity darts through a honeyed, waxy slick that extends the finish endlessly. It's already a heart-stopping wine but will continue to improve for decades to come.
Light in color, this 100% varietal wine was macerated with 50% stems and 50% whole berries before being aged in 500L neutral French-oak puncheons.

On the plump but balanced side, with a perfumed nose that's almost sweet for SB. In the mouth, it's fairly lively and lifted, with nectarine and melon flavors that morph into pink grapefruit on the finish. Decent quality; will get the job done.
This is the home estate of Madiran superstar Alain Brumont. The wine is big, bold, rich and packed with both fruit and tannins. It has great structure and a dense dusty tannic character that promises great aging. This is a major wine that needs time. Drink it starting from 2022.
Honig's basic Napa Valley Cabernet is consistently rich and drinkable at a young age. This 2008 is their best in many years, showing ripe blackberry, black currant and dark chocolate flavors, grounded with a firm minerality. Give this elegant young Cabernet a few hours in a decanter.
Dry and crisp, this is dominated by apple flavor. It's light in texture, attractively fruity and has a youthful feel to it. It could age a few months in bottle.
Fairly stylish and quite serious. There's darkness to the nose along with masculine, meaty, leathery aromas. And while the bouquet is sturdy and begs you to dig in, the palate is a little less generous as it shows some herbal sharpness at its core. Overall there's commendable cherry and plum flavors, but the wine lacks some depth.
This is this winery's fourth vintage, and the promise is strong, as this is one of the better white wines to emerge from Southern California in recent years. Anjou pear rinds, lime and apple scents show on the slightly sour but very aromatic nose. The flavors are rounded with pear and lime, but the sharp and chalky texture is most compelling, making for a clean and crisp wine.
For the vintage, this is a rich wine, which means it has concentration, solid fruit characters and hints of chocolate. It also has bright acidity that lifts the wine and gives it a lighter final character.
Defined by sheer richness and opulence, this oaky Chardonnay is meant to be opened now. It's rich and forward in pineapple and guava fruit, buttered toast, caramel and honey flavors.
Though Syrah is not new to Southern Oregon, the recent rise in quality may surprise you. DanCin's Danseur is estate-grown in the Applegate Valley. It's an aromatic, tightly woven gem, loaded with plum, berry and kirsch, highlights of herb and bramble and a finish streaked with chocolate, espresso and licorice. Tannins are polished and the flavors linger delightfully.
This is a ripe Syrah, with warm, earthy, raisiny aromas of blackberry, vanilla and prune. The palate is so dense and extracted that it feels spongy, while a full-force flavor profile includes inky blackberry, graphite and minty oak. On the finish, this is fat, jammy and baked in flavor while soft in feel. Drink through 2018.
An intense concentration of blackberry and cassis fruit marks this dry, opulent wine. It could easily be a Cabernet Sauvignon, with its rich vein of tannins and distinguished structure. Although it's a bit hot in alcohol, it represents one of the more successful varietal bottlings of Petit Verdot, which is normally a blending grape. Drink now–2014.
There's a playful touch of smoky toast and dusty minerality that adds a deeper dimension to this modern and beautifully constructed wine (one third is aged in barrique). Pair it with leafy greens, seafood and white meat.
From vineyards close to Juliénas, this is a bright wine full of cherry juice and fresh acidity. It does have a sense of structure with a background of tannins and minerality that will allow it to age, although it is delicious now.
A blend of 55% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot, 16% Cabernet Franc and 4% Malbec, this top-end offering from Macari boasts bold aromas of weedy cassis tempered with toast and chocolate.

Made with 50% Trebbiano, 20% Grechetto, 10% Verdello, 10% Malvasia and 10% Drupeggio, this has aromas of ripe peach and apricot. The aromas carry over to the rather sweet, lively palate together with a hint of almond. Enjoy soon.

Very ripe apple aromas mix with light peach and summer melon on the nose of this light and refreshing sipper from the family's Edna Valley property. It's clean and tight on the palate, showing more stone fruit, lime skins and a racy minerality.
A good value, classic Oregon Pinot Gris with strong, fresh flavors of crisp sliced pear. Hints of orange and citrus add zest and lift the mid-palate. The wine finishes with a nice splash of spice.
A celebrated vintage from an estate that consistently delivers quality at attractive prices, this Riserva sparkling wine is packed with Golden Delicious apple, vanilla cream, apricot and toasted nut. There's a sassy touch of clove on the close.
A fairly tannic Zinfandel, this is made from organic grapes. Enjoy with pizza or hamburgers.
This wine seems rather unfocused with indistinct tannins and fruit. There is a soapy texture, and the red berry fruits seem awash with acidity.
Color, power, flavor and commendable balance; that's pretty much the format for Punto Final, one of Argentina's go-to brands for Malbec. This youngster is ripe and ready, and it holds form onto a long finish. If it seems a little young and clumsy upon pouring, air it out and it'll improve.
Here's a balanced and bright Chardonnay from a cool climate region in northern Italy that shows crisp aromas of peach and citrus followed by light shadings of spice and bitter almond. The wine is silky and smooth with more citrus on the close.
This tastes riper and hotter than the winery's other Pinots I tasted, almost to the point of raisins and stewed prunes. The vintage was very difficult, with stupendous heat waves that challenged both growers and vintners. The wine does its best, but can't quite overcome the ill effects of the heat.
Oddero is one of the most important historic brands in the Langhe and the Rocche di Castiglione Barolo highlights this legacy very nicely. The wine is redolent of wild berries, plums, spice, white truffle and cherry liqueur. It's an elegant, tonic wine with a garnet and amber coloring.
You can't beat the everyday low price of this savory wine. There's a fresh element of ripe fruit and exotic spice that is backed by touches of crushed black pepper, tobacco and leather.
The nose isn't very expressive but reveals a hint of farmyard and toast. The funky farmyard note carries over to the rustic palate along with a confectionary note, a green sensation of powdered sage and bitter walnut skin. The shorty, raspy finish dries out the mouth.
This has an unusual mix of aromas, from Asian spice and menthol to weedy underbrush and celery. The muddled palate is slightly fizzy, suggesting sweet and sour sauce, oak-driven spice and dried fruit. Bracing tannins leave a lean, raspy finish.
Ripe, spicy, raspberry and cherry fruit flavors mark this vibrant Pinot Noir. It shows the flashy elegance of the Santa Lucia Highlands, with brisk acidity lifting the fruit. Drink it over the next few years.

From vines averaging 60 years of age in Jurassic chalky clay, this ripe, buttery wine has plenty of ripe apples, pears and a generous texture. An attractive touch of toast adds to the complexity. Drink now.
Very tart, with a deep, tannic, earthy mineral streak. There's an iron/earth streak running through all Abacela wines; here it comes across as iron and slightly bitter licorice. This is still very young and green; the score might well improve with more time in the bottle.
Stewed strawberries, blackberry jam, maple, brown sugar, black pepper, teriyaki and pork fat show on the lush nose of this bargain bottling. It's soft on the palate, with fruity strawberry and ripe plum flavors, as well as some more serious beef char elements. It's fun, easy and delicious.
A blend created for Schröder & Schÿler, a Bordeaux wine merchant founded in 1739, this is soft, ripe with plenty of red berry fruits. It has some firm tannins still although these are rounded out with the juicy fruits and final acidity. It's an attractive wine to drink now.
Juicy sweet is an apt moniker for this fruity, forward Riesling. The grapey, sugary palate is a bit confected in style, but easy and approachable.
So elegant and sophisticated, this is a great value in California Chardonnay. Although it's dry, it's rich and delicious in pineapples, pears, mangoes and honey, with an opulent overlay of sweet oak. The brisk acidity is balanced, and gets the mouth watering.
Soft apple- and honey-flavored wine that has dry botrytis and a spiced texture. With flavors of lemon curd and peach, it is more in a light Barsac style, fruity as well as sweet.

Aromas like black olive, clove and dark cherry continue in the flavors of this full-flavored and full-bodied wine. Mellow oak notes like cedar and tobacco add complexity.
The 2009 Shirazes from South Australia have been grading out well, and Shingleback's is no exception, representing an excellent value. It's dense and jammy, with rich black cherry fruit framed by oaky notes of baking spices and cocoa. This intense, extracted wine can stand up to hearty braises or stews.
Planted on volcanic soil, this vineyard with its steep slopes produces impressive wines. This concentrated, deeply powerful wine is structured, powered by superripe quince and lychee fruits. Complex and still maturing, the wine needs at least until 2018.
A burly surprise from southern Oregon; there are flowery, almost honeyed elements to the black-fruit nose. It scores big points in the mouthfeel category—it’s round, chewy and creamy. Oak is a giant factor here; you’d better like mounds of toasty wood. If you do, the plump plummy fruit will make your day. But stand clear of this hefster if you prefer elegant, streamlined Pinot Noir.
For Central Otago Chardonnay, this is rather rich and chunky on the palate, delivering hints of grilled sweet corn and ripe melon. It falls off a bit on the finish, so drink up over the next several months.

Creamy and lush with a silky texture; drink now–2014.
A spicy but subtle nose of cigar spice and red berry lead into a spirited character of more spice and medium body on the palate.

This summery Riesling wafts of ripe yellow cherries and blossoms. Dry in style with a rich, rounded mouthfeel, it's deeply concentrated with stone fruit flavors accented by hints of waxy lemon and lime skin. It's delicious now for its fragrant, fruity exuberance, but likely to develop its waxy, mineral complexities through 2019–2021.

Made with 100% Cabernet Moravia (an indigenous crossing of Cabernet Franc and Zweigelt) this wine has an interesting bouquet of ripe red fruits marked by eucalyptus and a heavy vegetal note. Fruit flavors, especially dark plum, shine through on the palate, while greener herbal notes make their presence known on the invigorating finish.
There are brambly, wild berry or crabapple notes here that are reinforced by the wine's naturally high acidity. This Barbera shows a pretty ruby color with dense thickness and a smooth, berry-filled finish.
The Torrontes character shows on the nose, meaning there's detectable lychee and orange blossom scents. The dowside is that the palate is rather thick and honeyed but devoid of flavor. Seems to be fading into the night.
Despite this wine's very pale color, it shows ample weight and a silky texture on the palate. Peach and melon flavors pick up hints of berry and citrus on the finish.

Somehow, winemaker Luca Paschina manages to make a Vermentino that will make you feel like you are sitting at a café in Liguria. Lush aromatics of pear drop and canteloupe lead into flavors of lemon, green pear, snap pea, button mushroom and sea spray. Well-balanced, this is smooth and fresh, with hints of nuts on the long finish.
Slightly stewed or baked, but there's enough plum and herb complexity to keep it interesting. Soft and low in acid; supple and easy to drink over the next few months. Imported by Aidil Wines & Liquor Inc.
For the price, you get just what you pay for with this Chard. It's honeyd and soft, with flavors of buttered toast and apricot-orange jam.
Simple jammy aromas lead to a hard, acidic palate offers some red fruit flavor but also an undercurrent of field greens. A lasting streak of bell pepper on the finish doesn't help bring it around.
Much like the other 2011 red wine releases from Cave B, this offers thin, tart red fruit, and strong herb and stem flavors in the finishing tannins.
Medium sweet in style, this is as much about ripe tropical and pineapple fruits as about spice and richness. It's an opulent, full-bodied wine, showing its spice right up front. At the same time, it is well balanced, hinting at acidity at the end. Drink from 2015.
A dry, lovely Cabernet for drinking now. Shows the soft tannins and herbaceousness of Alexander Valley reds, with cherry, berry, currant and oak flavors. Earns extra points for the smooth, spicy finish.
A light, easy and cheery selection, with direct aromas and flavors of sweet cherry, red raspberry and strawberry. The mouthfeel is soft and approachable, with virtually no tannins and a clean, short finish. Drink up.
It begins with classic brut aromas of citrus, peach and strawberry, with oak, smoke and yeast shadings. But it’s surprisingly sweet. Well made and clean, with crisp acidity and nice restraint to the fruit. But those expecting a drier wine will be disappointed.
Aromas of ocean breeze and white clover are raw but good. This feels round, pulpy and citrusy, with green slightly bitter flavors of citrus, honey and brine. Acidity plays a big role in keeping this afloat. Drink immediately.
On multiple passes this smells a touch earthy, but also reserved and rich. A dense, pure, silky palate is not rough in the least, while chocolaty, oaky flavors merge with berry and cassis and end in elegant notes of pepper, spice and herbs. This is more or less ready to go; drink through 2020.
A strongly flavored, sugary, unsubtle wine, leaving little to the imagination. Swamps the mouth with ripe, jammy flavors of pineapples, apricots, mangoes, limes, kiwi fruit and honey.
Released too young, at just over a year of age, this Pinot tastes sugary, with primary fruit essence, glycerine, alcohol and caramelized oak giving it an uncomfortable sweetness. It's probably technically dry, and should actually taste dry by 2011, but it's certainly not ready to drink before mid-2010.
A rounded, wood-aged wine with great ripe fruits, pineapple and peach flavors. It's rich, lightly toasty and finely textured. It could age more, so drink from the end of 2014.
This winery seems to have mastered the formula for making clean, approachable wines that have mass appeal while staying true to their roots. Here you get leather, plum and pepper on the nose, with ripe black cherry and a touch of candied berry on the palate. Finishes with blueberry sweetness and just enough kick. Bargain hunters should buy this in quantity. Imported by Prestige Wine Imports Corp.
Nice wine with standard Rioja aromas of raspberry, vanilla, licorice and dill. The palate has life and kick due to protruding acidity, while the flavor profile is based on snappy, high-toned plum and red berry. Softer on the finish, where butter and vanilla notes rise up. Drinkable now but will hold for another few years.
Basic but in the best possible way. The nose is familiar, clean and inviting due to licorice, sweet black fruit and smoky aromas. Fresh in the mouth, with bright acidity pumping up berry, cassis and herbal flavors. Composed on the finish, with a high level of competence.
Soft and on the fat side, this is an easy wine, with its pear and melon flavors, spiced up by some pepper and lime. An attractive, ripe mouthful.
This Grechetto-based wine has a pretty straw appearance and definitely puts an emphasis on nuts, melon and stone fruit. Thanks to a smooth mouthfeel and spicy finish, it does liven up in the mouth.
Most Pinot Noirs would kill to have this depth of flavor. Although it's the winery's most basic, non-vineyard-designated Pinot, it's a fantastic wine, rich, mellow and delicious. Offers wave after wave of cherries, currants, cola, pomegranates and persimmons that are as sweet as jam, yet the finish is thoroughly dry. The wine is a masterful blend of seven vineyards. Drink now–2014.
Six clones are blended into this wine, an elegant and aromatic style of Pinot Noir. With breathing time it adds volume, showing more heft and complexity. The pretty red fruits are set in a frame that shows more minerality than tannin.
Earthy in a way that's almost savage, this wine's bouquet discloses layers of cooked mushroom and forest floor, the texture velvety smooth. The grapes hail from the Green Valley appellation within the larger Russian River Valley, with minerality that's crisp and buoyant. The finish shows some of the oak.
The bouquet of this rosé is soft and delicate, with subtle notes of strawberry hull, watermelon rind and white-plum flesh. The mouthfeel is light, but with a slight roundness to the midpalate, with a lightly bitter-lime flavor that adds zip to the finish.

95–97 While this wine certainly has power, it is its almost other-worldly floating character that is most striking. The fruit glides over the palate, leaving freshness with layers of intense acidity and wood to finish.
Pineapple, citrus blossom, and white peach aromas prepare your palate for tastes of green apple, lemon zest and apricots. The finish is crisp and acidic.

Earth, saddle leather and roasted berry aromas lead the meaty nose to a round, mildly tanninc palate that's holding full plum and berry flavors.

This winery's '02 Pinot was very good. The '03 is even better.

A minor wine, dry, tannic and awkward, with modest cherry, cola and oak flavors. Okay for everyday drinking, but not going anywhere.
A new project from Gus Janeway, showcasing his careful and detailed touch with Rogue valley grapes. The blend is 30% malbec, 30% cabernet sauvignon, 21% merlot, 12% cab franc and 7% syrah, but rather than being a smorgasbord it is a focused, complex and layered wine that all knits together. Most telling, Janeway has successfully tamed to tough, rugged tannins that are the biggest challenge for southern Oregon reds.

It's a style of Cabernet that may have fallen out of favor, but shows exceptional grape growing and winemaking skills.
Lots of rich blackberry, cherry and chocolate fruit in this dry Cabernet, with a pretty application of oak. Tannins and acids give it plenty of structure, but it's not an ager.

Firm and tannic with balanced, juicy red fruits—sweet strawberry and red-plum skins. This could age 2–3 years. Its structure is supported by the fruit and wood flavors.

Full-bodied but elegant , it leads with aromas of white spring flowers and stone fruit. The round palate delvers juicy white peach and citrus notes alongside fresh acidity.

Aged for 10 years before disgorging and a further time before release, this is Gosset's top wine from a great vintage year.

It will age further at least until 2022, although it is totally drinkable now.

Take a cool year like 2010—which is tough to begin with—on a late ripener like Cabernet, and throw in a ton of char and burnt oak, and what you get is a wine that smells like a smoldering campfire. The palate is tannic, while roasted flavors of charred black fruits and burning wood end with molasses.
The barest hint of copper marks this white wine, which offers up aromas of peach and cantaloupe—or perhaps they're just suggested by the wine's color? Flavors are a bit musky, showing berry flavors before some tannins come in on the lengthy finish.
A gigantic Chardonnay. What it lacks in subtlety it more than makes up for in sheer power. Dazzles with pineapple jam, mango, pear, lime, buttered toast and sweet oak flavors, balanced with fine acidity. There's a minerally stoniness that makes it even more complex. Drink now–2014.

Drink 2012–2018.
Rocca's most expensive wine is 100% Cabernet, although it doesn't say so on the label.

Talk about an overoaked wine. From the start, this struggles to keep it real. Aromas of shoe polish, vanilla and scorched oak are dominant. Firm and tannic in the mouth, this Carignan tastes almost entirely of wood resin and mint. That this is oaky and resiny on the finish is no surprise.

Like always, this Merlot is a potent brew of dark fruit, molasses, peppery spice and Chilean terroir. The plush palate is extremely ripe and forward, as it offers mounds of berries and chocolate. New World at every turn, and what's wrong with that? 38,000 cases produced, so it's available.
Shows some characteristic Prüm stinky notes, but there's plenty of fruit lurking underneath. Pear, honey, melon and citrus flavors give an impression of great ripeness, amplified by the creamy texture and custardy mouthfeel, but there's also enough crisp acidity for balance. Drink now–2025, maybe longer.
Definitely on the ripe side, this aged Cabernet offers aromas of green pepper, chocolate, vanilla bean and black cherry. It delivers a pretty, modern approach and a nice, gritty texture in the mouth.
Here's a fragrant white that opens with aromas of spring blossom, orchard fruit and a whiff of brimstone. On the bright juicy palate, a savory saline note energizes yellow apple, Bartlett pear and lemon zest.
Here is a steady and clean expression of Sangiovese that delivers steady pulses of cherry and oak spice with smaller doses of cola and licorice at the back. The wine is dark and concentrated with a touch of sourness in the mouth.
This bubbly, semisweet and simple Lambrusco offers bright fruit flavors of crushed strawberry and red raspberry alongside a confectionary note and tangy acidity.
Pungent kiwi, peach fuzz and notes of herb and gooseberry surround a full-bodied, robust and rounded palate with streaks of citrus and medium acidity.
This is delicious white Burgundy. The fruit is lively, crisp, lemony, while the texture is rounded, just tight enough to give structure, but open enough to be relaxed. The finish offers just a hint of spice.
The tannins are really nice on this red blend. They're smooth and ripe and feel just fine in the mouth, and they frame luscious flavors of blackberries, currants, chocolate, cola, leather and peppery spices. The finish is a bit sweet, but it's an elegantly constructed wine for drinking now.
This is a ripe juicy wine with fine red fruits and acidity. The smoky tannins are a fine support to the berry flavors. It is developing well and should be ready to drink from 2017.
Forward and easy in cherry, currant, raspberry, tangerine zest, cola and peppery spice flavors, this Zin has a gentle texture. There's also a wealth of firm, dusty tannins that could help the wine age for a few years.
This is very lemony, with a flint note and fine acidity that the wine a crisp edge. It's lively and bright, with a rounded character. The finish has a lightly salty taste.
Smells candied as well as burnt and stemmy. The palate is adequate on the surface but hollow in the middle, with dry, herbal raspberry flavors. Tastes more stemmy and distracted the longer you play with it. Not ready for prime time.
Delicate floral aromas suggest beeswax and honeysuckle. The bright, refreshing palate offers juicy white peach, Bartlett pear and a white almond note alongside crisp acidity.
This is one of the best Pets I've had this year. It's dry and compellingly delicious, a subtle wine of great intricacy, from the blackberry and coffee flavors to the smoothly tannic structure to the classic finish, but be forewarned: The alcohol is 15.9%.
The richness of the aroma belies the elegance of this outstanding Pinot Noir. Tightly woven scents of sweet herb, tobacco, clove, forest floor fungus and spicy red fruits provide an introduction to a wine that can only be called svelte. It's as smooth as silk in the mouth, loaded with flavor and polished to a warm glow, which is exactly what it leaves you with after just one sip.
An impressive young Bordeaux blend, mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, that shows impeccably ripe, clean fruit but also the hard tannins of its famous mountain. Thoroughly dry, its astringency cannot mask an eruption of blackberries and black currants, accented by smoky oak. Give this lovely wine a good five years to begin to mature.
There's a hit of green gooseberry flavor in this dry, tart Sauvignon Blanc. It has enough citus and tropical fruit ripeness to make it tasty, but it's still a bit green and unripe on the palate.
Herbaceousness marks this wine, which doesn't seem to be ripe enough. True, there are some pretty black-cherry and chocolate notes in the aroma that carry through in the mouth. But it drinks thin, although not rough, and there's a green chlorophyll note that no amount of aging will get rid of.
Vincent Bouchard's Quinta do Tedo has produced an outstanding 2009. It's in the soft, rich and ripe style of the year; its flavors of black plum juice and sweet berry have a rounded character, with underlying structure that promises good aging.
The aromas seem quite muddled with coffee, cranberry and currant fighting to get through. It's lighter in style with the variety seeming to get lost.
This Xinomavro offers a sturdy nose of cherry, spicebox, leather and pepper, with balanced favors of deep spice, red fruit and leather. The wine has pronounced acidity and smooth tannins. Pair with roasted meats, cheeses.
A wine that has taken the fruity route, with peach, sweet apple and honey flavors dominating. It is ripe and lush, although not hugely concentrated. It is already ready to drink, easy and friendly.
This ripe Saint-Émilion is generous with its rounded perfumed Merlot. It gives the wine richness, juicy acidity and an open texture. Touches of tannin do bring in some structure, but the emphasis is on the fruitiness and fresh aftertaste. Drink from late 2017.
The pedigree of this vineyard shows in every aspect. It's not just the ripe black cherry and pomegranate fruit, or the brisk acidity, or the lush, gorgeous tannin structure. It's the incredible complexity, showing all kinds of mushroom,  cola, smoked meat and spice notes. Simply gorgeous now, and should develop over the next 10 years.
This has an elegant, fruity, lightly spicy profile. Red cherry and nutmeg aromas meld with fresh and pure fruit flavors like red cherry and raspberry shaded by cinnamon and clove. It also offers a silky-smooth texture and medium body.
The blend is two-thirds Cabernet Sauvignon and one-third Petit Verdot, and the PV takes over the bouquet with bright floral aromas. There is some boysenberry fruit, with a strong herbal streak, and the tannins are slightly green and very astringent; the fruit seems buried in contrast.
A rich and rounded single-vineyard Chardonnay. It has weight and a smoky character to go with the peach, kiwi and lime juice flavors. The acidity is light, but does give a line of freshness.
Dark golden-yellow, this opens with inviting notes of toasted caramel. It remains bright in citrus on the palate, getting riper and steamier as it goes, developing deeper, richer flavors of preserved lemon and baked pear. From the winery's estate, this is a small-production wine well worth seeking.
Gritty match-stick aromas come with grapefruit and citrus scents. This is lifted and entirely regular for Chilean Sauvignon Blanc. Flavors of lemon, lime and grapefruit are soft and mealy for such a young wine, while bitterness enters the frame on the finish.
A suave Sangiovese-Cabernet Sauvignon blend with dark, minty, cola aromas that mix with serious red-fruit notes to create a character-packed bouquet. The palate is as ripe and aggressive as you want, but with good balance. Throughout the oak is present but integrated. Can hold through 2010 without much effort.
Pora Barbaresco offers an incredibly elegant and fine personality with beautiful accents of wild berry, dried ginger, cola, leather, spice and black licorice. The tannins are silky and very polished.
Citrus and pear notes lead the way in this bargain-priced Chardonnay from Down Under. It's reasonably tight and crisp for a wine in this bracket, carrying hints of well integrated vanilla through the lemony finish. Drink now.
Slightly oily, mature aromas of apple and peach break up quickly. This single-vineyard Albariño feels lean and narrow. Citrusy flavors of tangerine and grapefruit finish racy and zesty. Drink now.
Very soft, smooth and rather thick, this is one of those Pinots that flatters with scads of ripe fruit and toasty oak. It's certainly delicious in cherry, cocoa and spice, but has a certain one dimensionality.
Clean, stylish and easy to like, this has apple and green herb aromas. It shows a good weight and mouthfeel, with papaya, thyme and baked apple flavors. Medium long and smooth on the finish, this is a commendable value-priced bubbly.
Ripe, spicy tropical fruits give this wine a rich feel. There is a touch of caramel along with pineapple and apricot flavors. It is full bodied and structured, with a finish that shows acidity and a streak of nutmeg.
Green pepper and tobacco aromas signal some of the sour fruit that appears on the palate. Tastes of beets and pie cherries and an oaky, disparate finish doesn't do much to shape things up. Too sour and scattered.
Aromas of plum, clove, coffee and wood spice lead to plush plump fruit flavors. The tannins give a light squeeze.
Red fruit aromas have a roasted edge, oddly balanced out by cooler eucalyptus notes. The palate bursts with berries, smoothed out by peppery, minerally nuances. A very good wine, but one that feels more like a solid Côtes-du-Rhone than a candidate for the cellar.
Untamed and herbal on the bouquet, this has a coconutty sweetness that's offset by scratchy berry and grassy notes. It feels firm, with high acidity and tight tannins; the herbal flavors mingle with notes of sweet cassis and baked berry.
This is the winery's junior version of their very fine Purple Label Cabernet. It's a very good wine, if a little eccentric for a Cabernet Sauvignon. With its spices and briary berry, smoked meat and wild herb flavors, it could almost be a Zinfandel.
Soft, creamy, rounded wine, which seems initially unfocused. But there are some good pear and kiwi flavors. The end, though, is dilute.
Briary, woody, scratchy aromas announce plenty of new oak, and there are also balsamic notes, leather and wild berry scents to ponder. The palate is big, grapy and lusty, while the flavors are baked, jammy and finish with a clear note of raisin as well as chocolate.
Spiced plum and raspberry aromas are on the full and dark side. This offers good volume and a medium-plus body with black cherry and black currant flavors. A dark-leaning, peppery finish tops off this full-fruited Pinot.
Named after a mountain in Washington's North Cascade Range, the barrel notes of toast, sawdust and char are out front on this 100% Tempranillo. It's rich and chocolaty with firm, dry tannins.
Moderately aromatic, this offers notes of red apple, jasmine, and peach. It drinks off dry leaning toward medium sweet, with abundant peach flavors with a creamy feel. It needs a bit more acidity to hold it all together.
Like most barrel-fermented Viuras from Rioja, this smells oaky but low on fruit. Round and resiny on the palate, this tastes mostly of saucy oak and briny citrus. The finish is sound in feel but challenging in flavor.
This gorgeously inviting wine shines with barely ripe pear, lemon and lychee flavors. Its focused, stony minerality lends freshness and pleasing complexity on the palate, as orange blossom aromas and flavors seep in.
A balanced wine, this shows both fresh, crisp fruit and the beginnings of toasty maturity. Its richness contrasts with a steely texture and tight, lemon-zest character that gives the wine a delicious tension.
This may be the most expensive Malbec in California, but it's a really good wine that is full-bodied and deeply flavored. Like a great Cabernet, it shows polished black currant, spicy plum and new-oak flavors, with wonderfully rich, sweet tannins and soft acids. So easy to drink, so delicious now, but you might try cellaring it through 2010.
Tightly wound and acidic, with forceful red-berry flavors that are spicy and zesty. Finishes a little on the raw side, with cranberry notes and a hard crescendo. Tempranillo with Garnacha and Cabernet.
This is a finely tuned wine. On the one hand, it is crisp and fruity. On the other, it has fine concentration, with a zingy mineral texture. The wine is ready to drink.
A polished, smooth Cab for drinking now. It's soft and delicious, with herb-infused cherry, currant and cola flavors. Shows real fanciness in the tannin structure. Easy to find, with 36,000 cases produced.
The deep-copper color and complex fruit aromas of this wine seem well matched with a rather broad texture and medium-full body. The raspberry flavors have a meaty savory accent.
Four years of aging on the lees gives this particularly late-release Merlot a delightfully tactile mouthfeel. It's silky to the touch, yet voluminous on the palate, filling the mouth with flavors of ripe red cherry and cranberry accented by bramble, earth and potpourri. Sprightly in acidity yet rich in body, it lingers with intensity and persistence.
This is a superb value. The nose on this Syrah-Monastrell blend revolves around dusty berry and plum, while the palate is juicy, ripe, smooth and shows herb, spice and pulsing blackberry flavors. Doses of mint and hard spices carry a long finish to a warm resting point.
Made with overripe Garganega grapes, this opens with aromas of baked yellow fruit, lightly toasted oak and roasted almond. The round palate offers candied citrus zest, mature apple, dried apricot, a confectionary note and a hint of liqueur. Soft acidity accompanies the rich flavors.
This is concentrated fruity and very spicy. It has an intensity of fruit flavor, its nutmeg character balanced by crisp green apples, pear skins and a great depth of acidity. Screwcap.
Cormì is a 50-50 blend of Corvina and Merlot that shows soft, jammy fruit aromas of blackberry and plum backed by chocolate and tobacco. The wine is rich and dense with firm, smooth tannins.
This yeasty wine has some fruit, although it veers more to a mature character. It should be drunk now.
McKinley Springs vineyard has provided the grapes, and Joe Gunselman has crafted a spicy, forward and aromatic Syrah, co-fermenting it with 5% Viognier. The light fruit flavors of raspberry and pie cherry—remain clear and fresh through the mid-palate, but fail to add to that slender strength in the finish. In fact, the wine turns a bit chalky, and feels prematurely dried out, without the complexity that made the glorious 2005 so memorable.
This young Walla Walla winery is gaining confidence with each new release. This blend of Semillon and Viognier (17%) is oaky and warm, with broadly fruity citrus and stone fruits. Lots of spice, vanilla and a hint of hazelnut.
A non vintage blend of Zinfandel, Syrah and Petite Sirah, this wine captures attributes of each of those grapes. The nose is rich with scents of raspberries, delving slightly towards tart cherries. The finish enters Syrah territory, with earthy leather and spice.
This is a light, pleasant, balanced Syrah that shows a mix of earth, herb, saline, soy, cherry and chocolate flavors, but all subdued. Take a high-end Washington Syrah and lighten it up—those are the flavors here. If you value elegance and complexity, this will be just right for you.
Elegant flavors of apricot and honey are light and delicate, with a lively acidity keeping the wine dancing on the palate. Though the wine shows intense depth of flavors, it's never heavy and has a clean, poised finish. From start to finish, the wine is balanced and refined, with a character that speaks of its unique terroir.
Nerobufaleffj delivers ripe fruit, blackberry and some distant tones of citrus and apple. It's frank, easy and smooth on the close.
Frothy and robust, this presents aromas of blue flower, ripe plum, fig and cassis that carry over to the palate, along with spicy blueberry. It's balanced with sharp acidity and hearty tannins.
Horsey and raisiny on the nose, which indicates what's coming: that's a chunky palate and a one-note flavor of prune. This is what overripe raw materials can produce.
For whatever reason, the Coddington lacks the extra dimension of the other 2011 Kumeu River Chardonnays. It's still an excellent wine, just linear and crisp, with subtle toast framing citrusy fruit.
The intense herbaceous aroma is softened on the palate by the wine's lemon-curd flavor and smooth texture. Rich with intense fruitiness, this has notes of black currant and pink grapefruit, with bright acidity on the finish.
Acidity dominates this wine, giving it a tartness—like a squeeze of lime juice. Past that is an enormously rich, dry, vibrant wine, explosive in raspberries, cherries and ripe, sweet persimmons. New French oak, with its caramel-like toastiness, is perfectly in keeping with the wine's volume. It's a bit disjointed now, but give it 3–4 years in the cellar, and it should come around.
This wine is principally Merlot (58%) and Cabernet Sauvignon (17%), with the balance Petit Verdot, Malbec and Cabernet Franc. Aromas of mortared green herbs mix with anise and the blackest of cherries. The palate is medium bodied, delivering enjoyment but coming off as a bit green.
Ripe, soft and smoky, this has strawberry and red plum flavors. The acidity surfaces later, along with a light, dry texture. The wine could age for 3–4 years.
Jammy strawberry aromas are alluring but light, which suggests more of an Old World style compared to most of the beefy, brawny Malbecs out there today. The palate is crisp and agile, with light-framed raspberry flavors. More elegant than hefty, but also a little hollow on the midpalate and finish.
A perfumed wine, it's very fresh and bright with strawberry flavors as well as a delicate touch of tannin. A delicious wine to drink now.
A good (not great) year for this cuvée, brings supple strawberry and cherry flavors, streaked with a strong taste of chicken stock. The wine is drinking okay, but re-tasting on the second day did not show the sort of development that promises a good long cellar life.
On sweetness alone, this dessert wine earns a good score. The orange fruit flavors, which are so pure and pinpointed, are exorbitantly rich in wild honey and vanilla cream. The alcohol level is high, but there's a beautiful streak of vibrant acidity that provides balance. Easy to drink over repeated glasses.
Ultraripe berry, herb, cedar, and toast aromas. Refined plum, licorice, and coffee flavors show great appeal, and the supple, elegant mouthfeel plays into the finish with dark fruit and cocoa-powder notes. Bright tannins and good fruit-to-acid balance promise a fine future. Hold for two to four years; drink to 2014.
Aromas include subtle yellow apple, pear, lemon zest and a hint of peach. Fresh acidity gives it a clean finish.
No surprises here; just good, clean fun. The nose is fresh as a spring garden and the palate delivers nothing but pure lemon-lime. The feel and bubble bead are lively and friendly, while the finish is crisp, smooth and somewhat long. Mildly sweet but not at all cloying. Imported by Astoria.
Initially a lean wine, with its tannins prominent. Then, as it opens up, the soft ripeness of the fruit comes through, its spice edged with black currant flavors. There is some pepper, black and red berry fruits and a leather texture that holds the wine together. Screwcap.
Williams Selyem expresses the intricacies of this vineyard with more consistency than any other winery. This remarkably intellectual, ageworthy wine is bone dry, with marked acidity and complexity. The flavors range from wild cherries, cola and balsam to raspberry tart and buttered cinnamon toast. Its complexity is like a mandala, increasing in beauty the longer one examines it. A softly tannic bitterness lingers on the finish; drink 2019–2030.
Don't be fooled by the pale, almost white, color. This is a spicy herbal wine that comes from a selection of the estate's best vineyards. It has a fine cut of acidity to keep it crisp. It is juicy and packed with fruit, immediately attractive. The aftertaste with its zesty tang is refreshing. Drink now.
A very deep color and smoky, meaty aromas get this full-bodied wine off to a great start, then saturated blackberry, blueberry and espresso flavors kick in. All that fruit comes in a firm package of fine-grained tannins to add welcome texture, and the concentration of flavor lingers on the finish, too.
This is Primitivo-Barbera blend with dabs of Nebbiolo and Dolcetto in the mix. It's light and youthful, with cranberry fruit and the sort of juicy acidity that freshens the palate. Not especially concentrated, but crisp and clean, with a bracing minerality.
Grape fruit leather, dense violets, black slate and a hint of barnyard aromas make for an interesting, purple-leaning nose on this wine. The palate is quite herbal, tinged with dried oregano as well as a berry-juice ripeness.
Not much going on in this Chardonnay-based Port-style wine. Its not particularly sweet, with basic white chocolate and pineapple cream flavors.

Even in a less-than-ripe vintage such as this, the Leland stands out in the Erath lineup. Tight and herbal, this has an array of Pinot-specific fruits that are of medium concentration. Its balanced use of barrel aging brings a chocolate flavor to the finish.
There's a beefy, meaty element on the nose that is not completely masked by the sweet nature of the fruit and cherry aromas also present. The wine's texture is thick and slightly gritty.
The best Grace to date, the wonderfully fruity entry bounces along, offering a punch bowl full of spicy cherries, with extensive highlights. Sniff and taste streaks of clove, coffee, fresh earth and mushroom—all clean and harmonious. This may be drunk immediately with enjoyment, or set aside as your special occasion wine with a decade or more of ageability.
Citrus and salad-like aromas are more subdued and neutral than punchy. This feels melony and lower than normal on zestiness. Flavors of green fruits and mild herbs finish mellow and slightly bitter.
This simple style of Marlborough Pinot delivers notes of bramble berry, licorice and cola on the nose, with a slightly more complex palate of dark cherry, mocha spice and dried leaves. The oak is a little prevalent throughout and texturally it's on the lean and mean side, but the fruit carries through until the end, keeping the gluggability factor up.
In a year where so many Barbarescos are heavy and slightly plummy, this is lighter and the fruit aromas are more primary. On the palate the flavors show elements of wild strawberries, lavender and smoke, and the wine is balanced and finishes well. A really pleasant Barbaresco that will evolve for a few more years.
This defines small-production, high-end Priorat. Leather, tomato, spice and tobacco are draped all over subdued plum and cherry aromas. The palate is silky in feel, with peppery spice, mocha and red-fruit flavors. On the finish, anise and mild herb flavors dominate. Drink now–2017. Only 250 cases made.

Deep color, bold fruit aromas and substantial, spicy flavors lend significant power and concentration to this full-bodied wine. It's nearly dry, well structured and balanced, with appealing blackberry, nutmeg and cinnamon flavors.
Sharp, herbal and varietal, with a deep rose color. Strawberry and Bing cherry fruit shines here, but the tannins take over in the finish. Some further bottle age may help to smooth it out.

Howard Park's single-vineyard Cabernet and Shiraz bottlings offer consistently good value for the money. The 2005 Scotsdale Shiraz delivers layers of mixed berries, baking spices and hints of dried fruit and toasty oak. It's full-bodied, lush and creamy-textured in the mouth, with a long finish powered by fruit and shaped by dusty tannins. Drink now-2020.
The name and packaging scream “concept wine,” but what's in the bottle will win you over. It's full and rubbery, with pleasant yet generic berry aromas. The palate is racy and fairly hefty and tannic, with black raspberry, plum and mild herbal flavors. Grabby, with good acidity on the finish.
Forest, mint and campfire scents are complemented by brambly black cherry in this explosively complex wine. Soft and subtle, it has juicy layers of cranberry, orange and maraschino, with a roundness and firmness to the strong tannin. The finish is all about coffee, cardamom and five spice.
Following on the heels of the last vintage, this Pinot is right up there in complexity and deliciousness.

Fine now despite its youth, it should gain in power and subtlety through 2008.

This is a hard-edged wine, a typical trait of young Pommard. It has a firm, dry and tannic character, and the ripe, generous fruit sits underneath. Wait for at least five years for this wine to be ready.

You get the better parts of both worlds here: It's both classy and casual. If it's slightly austere on its own, with sharpness and palate-scrubbing acids, just place some spicy food alongside it and you're home free. Ginger chicken is a particularly good match.

These are arguably the most long-lived and cellarworthy wines in Washington—if not in the entire country.
A nominally sweet red-candy note helps define the upbeat nose, and it all makes sense once you know that there's 20% Garnacha in the wine along with 75% Tempranillo and Mazuelo.

Give it a lot of decanting time.
A spicy wine, with nutmeg and allspice as well as peppered plums. Against this exotic background, the tannins are solid and concentrated, suggesting good aging potential.

A fine, elegant Pinot Noir, with juicy red fruits that roll around the mouth with freshness. While not powerful, this is delicious, cool Pinot Noir, just a touch peppery. Screwcap.

A very perfumed wine, with white flower aromas, flavors of herbs and spice. It has weight as well as acidity, a tangy structured edge. Screwcap.
Ripe and fruity, this is full of red cherry fruit. It has a mineral-driven structure that gives it a firmly textured edge and brings out the acidity. This could age for several years.
The very pure scent of green Conference pear peel rises from the glass. It is soon tempered by peppery yeast notes, but characterized throughout but that dual nature of freshness and the plumpness of rounded yeast. This contrast provides interest and makes this rather moreish, especially once you've savored the long spicy finish.
Here's a cool climate Chard with bright, citrusy acidity that boosts its tropical fruit flavors. With a smoky edge of oak, and lots of tangy spices, it's clean and refreshing.
Plump and mouthfilling, this Sauvignon Blanc offers ripe pink grapefruit and gooseberry flavors that veer toward red berries and stone fruits, yet maintain a sense of focus thanks to crisp lime and grapefruit notes on the finish.

Spicy wood adds to the fresh berry fruits that show strongly. With acidity balanced by the smoky flavors, it's a light, bright wine that will be ready to drink soon. Think about late 2015.

High-toned citrus aromas lead to a sharp, spritzy palate with pithy flavors and lots of zest. Doesn't taste like much besides tangy lime and citrus.
The wine is tight, green and herbal. It has some fruitiness, but that is suppressed by general underripeness. The tannins are hard at the end.

Designed with the specific intent of aging, brooding aromas of blue and red fruit, earth and spice lead to a saturated seamless palate. It drinks beautifully now, but should have a long life in front of it. Best after 2022.
This wine seems overtaken with scents and flavors of tree tar and resin. The impression of pine resin cuts out the fruit, leaving some woody flavors in the finish.

The palate is lively with black raspberry before the chalky, still quite stiff tannins arise, carrying flashes of cigar box, pencil shavings and bittersweet chocolate.
Minerally power is the main theme to the bouquet on this Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend that comes with notes of seashell and even more briary berry and spice aromas.

91-93 Barrel sample. Flavors of acid red berries dominate the wine, leaving the tannins and structure somewhat buried. The wine is very juicy, almost too fruity.
This is a balanced wine from an estate owned by Herdade do Esporão based in the Alentejo. With ripe tannins and juicy fruit, it has some structure as well as blackberry fruitiness. Drink this wine from 2020.
This is a pretty good Cabernet, showing some real fanciness, with soft tannins framing blackberry, currant, anise and herb flavors and a touch of sweet, smoky oak. Not an ager, so drink up.
The vibrant, opaque purple color of this wine attests to its good concentration. The nose shows attractive notes of cherry cola while flavors on the palate are disappointingly diffuse, reminiscent of a red berry soup. The soft, sweetish palate with velvety tannins finishes a bit short.
A dark, big, gutsy wine, full-bodied and dry, and filled with ripe, exuberant flavor. Blackberries, cherries, cassis and smoky oak flood the mouth, bright, delicious and complex, and with a very long finish. This is a serious Cabernet Sauvignon that will evolve in the bottle, but is fine to drink now.
From 50-year-old vines, this is Sorrel's top cuvée of white Hermitage, laden with scents of truffled honey and almonds. Yet despite that obvious richness on the nose, it's a bit more restrained on the palate than the 2005, with a more powerful structure and marginally less lushness. Not better, not worse, just different: longer on the finish, more tightly constructed and probably longer-lived.

Distinct aromas of sizzling bacon wafts from this blend of 75% Syrah and 25% Grenache, along with smashed blackberries and a slightly reductive tar quality. The chunky palate is very meaty and smoky, with dried red cherries, espresso and asphalt elements, proving a bit rustic.
Rather spare despite the cherry-berry, cola and spice flavors. The tannins are ultralight, and the acidity you'd expect from this cool coastal appellation isn't there. That leaves alcohol and fruit and a certain flabbiness.
Mostly a blend of Merlot (30%), Syrah (25%) and Cabernet Sauvignon (24%), this wine offers appealing, downright fruity aromas of red currant and raspberry jam. The lightly sweet cranberry and cherry flavors provide a lot of easy-drinking enjoyment.

A young wine that needs time to flesh out, this currently offers intense notes of garrigue and fresh, green herbs that are framed by fruity tones of green plum and lime leaf.

Round rather than racy, this fruity effort rings out with peach, melon and papaya flavors. It's finished dry with just 4g/L residual sugar, and the delicious finish has a honeysuckle note.
A light but sweet white with notes of fresh peach, lemon oil, melon and white florals. The mouth is full but balanced with good acidity and a softly spiced finish. Drink now.
Sparkling wines like this “Dosaggio Zero” (made from 50-50 Chardonnay and Pinot Nero) show the best of the territory they come from and promise to pair with a long list of foods. This example offers tones of citrus, stone fruit and almond. The wine is never heavy or too dense.

Just past the stage of primary fruit flavors, it drinks beautifully, but can certainly be cellared for another decade at least.
The new oak sticks out like a sore thumb, dominating this young wine with vanilla, buttered toast and charred wood aromas and flavors. Fortunately, the underlying wine also is very powerful in ripe blackberry and cherry fruit. This is an elegant, strong, impressive Cabernet, but the oak should be reined in to allow the beautiful fruit to star.

Only the second release of this wine, the 2010 is a plush, sexy example, featuring a combination of fruity and savory components. Black cherry fruit pushes through complex notes of smoke, sous bois and shiitake mushrooms. Drink now–2020.

Bold and red on the nose, with only mild herbal aromas. That slight herbal character extends to the palate, where red plum and red currant flavors take over.

Pear, red apple skins and lavender aromas start off this attractive Chard, while sweet lemon custard and fresh apple slices round out the palate. Medium weight, clean and balanced.
Not a great Zemis. It's woody, lemony and doesn't have the flesh, depth or complexity that we've seen before. The oak is heavy and the resulting coffee, burnt toast and charred aromas and flavors are a little too much. 250 cases made.
A blend of 80% Sangiovese, 15% Merlot and 5% Syrah, this robust but easy-drinking wine opens with aromas that recall blue flower, tilled soil, underbrush and ripe berries. The juicy palate delivers wild cherry, raspberry, white pepper and a hint of espresso along side soft tannins.

The long-term prospects are unclear, but it should have no trouble negotiating the next six years.

This is the type of wine that's giving resurgent Jumilla a positive reputation. The nose is smoky but still loaded with solid fruit, while the palate bubbles over with pure blackberry and plum.

The wine is blended with 10% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Merlot. Both bring their distinct contributions, the former in terms of firm tannins and black currants, the latter with a soft mellowness and suggestions of sweet red currants.

Fresh and inviting in a strawberry aroma, the palate brings ripe red-fruit and vanilla flavors to the mix. This is a medium-bodied, softly textured wine.
Despite cool growing conditions in 2011, this version of Kai shows raisiny, fully ripe aromas of loamy blackberry combined with graphite.

Drink through 2018.
This wine starts off with some reduction, opening up to show aromas of pineapple and herbs. The palate has generous tropical-fruit flavors, backed by tart acidity.
This wine from an ownership team of former pro baseballers Rich Aurilia and Dave Roberts is plush on the nose with dried strawberry, gingerbread and baking spices. The palate offers pomegranate-cherry juice along with graphite and coffee notes.
The nose on this bottling shows fresh boysenberry and primary grape scents, with lots of sweet rosemary and purple flower nuance. The sip is not overly complicated, with tar at first and then waves of blackberry and boysenberry fruit, lifted by thyme and peppercorns.
A little too soft and gentle for a Sonoma Coast Pinot, this lacking some dynamism, but there's no denying the deliciousness. It offers lush waves of raspberry and cherry purée, mocha and anise liqueur that are easy to love.
Very fresh, this is also a ripe, smooth-textured wine. Lemon flavors go with melon, pear and a touch of apricot. The wine has some weight, stylish and rounded. It should age another few months.
This opens with balsamic aromas of camphor, new leather, menthol and exotic spice. The tightly wound palate offers Morello cherry, cranberry, white pepper and grilled sage while assertive, close-grained tannins provide firm support.
Light, fruity and medium sweet, this is a pleasant, strawberry-flavored sparkling wine that lacks some acidity. It's best as an apéritif.
For a village wine, this is impressive. The richness and ripeness of the grapes translates into a full wine with white- fruit and spice flavors. But quite properly, there is a fine, poised mineral streak from the chalk soil that gives the wine shape and balance.
The color is deep, the aromas thick with wood smoke, bacon and dried plums, and the flavors are ripe, like blackberry syrup but dry. This is full bodied and very firm in texture due to mouth-coating tannins that are nearly matched on the finish by persistent and bold fruit flavors. Tasty now, it should age nicely through 2020.
This is an easy, gentle wine that's a little soft, with superripe cherry, persimmon and red licorice flavors. Delicious in the California way, it's showing its best now.
Aromatic, herbal wine, with evocative lavender, a core of dry tannins, fresh red plum juice fruit and flavors of wild thyme. The six years' aging has given the wine just the right amount of maturity to drink now.
Katnook's Prodigy Shiraz is full bodied and creamy in texture, combining authentic Shiraz aromas and flavors with easy-drinking, open-knit appeal. Scents of tar, black olive and blackberry give way to flavors of red peppercorn and mixed berry. Drink now–2018.
Notes of yeast and fresh pear hint that this is for keeping. Fruit is still held tightly curled at the core, waiting to blossom, while hints of peppery, herbal, yeasty spice already hold sway. This is concentrated but remains elegantly slender and beautifully toned. Poise and structure are the hallmarks.
Smoke and violet perfume are seductive on this elegant off-dry Riesling. Fresh green apple and pear flavors are tart but concentrated, wrapping up tightly with a squeaky-clean, lemon-lime finish.
This excellent vineyard has a proven track record, though here the grapes seem unevenly ripened, with brambly berry fruit that turns a little hot and raisined in the finish. Hints of cola and Dr. Pepper add some welcome depth to the flavors.
This full, foamy and aggressive sparkler gives off peach and nectarine aromas with an odd hint of scrambled egg. It's dry on the palate, with modest stone fruit flavors that turn bitter on the finish.
This is made with Sangiovese, Cab Franc and Cab Sauvignon (from 80-year-old vines). The results are a wine with renderings of dried herbs and grass backed by prune, exotic spice and nicely etched oak tones. The mouthfeel is lean without being hollow and offers bright spice on the finish.
Jammy berry aromas seem reduced at first, with notes of iodine and rubber. But with airing this packed Syrah comes around. A flush saturated tannic palate is home to toasty blackened berry, coffee and spice flavors. On the finish, burnt toast and espresso flavors don't slip. Drink through 2022.
This straightforward selection has aromas of violet, plum and light toast. The palate offers ripe, black fruit and pepper flavors, partnered with brisk acidity and firm tannins.
Thick, raisiny and a heavy on first take, with meaty aromas. Feels jammy and soft, but the middle layers aren't well defined. Tastes dark and sweet, with fig, prune and lemony oak. Bulky, but struggles to reach a higher plane.
For this winery's "basic" Cabernet, it shines brightly. Dark red berries get just the right spice and licorice accents. Rich raspberry fruit is balanced by chocolate, espresso bean and some smoke. Finishes toasty, with just the slightest streak of mint.
The Awatere is a subregion of Marlborough receiving more and more notice for its distinctive Sauvignons and Pinots. Vavasour was an early pioneer, and the 2007 is especially successful, offering up some slightly sweaty, nettle-y aromas to go along with hints of ripe melons and nectarines. It's nicely concentrated, with a slightly oily mouthfeel and good persistence.
Has aromas of anise gumdrop, chocolate and coconut. On the palate, black plum and blackberry fruit tastes slightly underripe. Not a fleshy, generous red. 85% Cab, 15% Shiraz. Imported by Joshua Tree Imports.
This full-bodied and savory blend of Chardonnay, Ribolla Gialla and Sauvignon opens with lovely aromas of hawthorne, apple and stone fruit. The vibrant palate delivers yellow peach, nectarine, Golden Delicious apple and candied citrus alongside bright acidity.
Very toasty wood aromas, the wine itself packed with new wood, fresh spice, the fruit lost somewhere at this stage. But it does have some weight and underlying hints of concentration.
The nose is rather closed on this 80% Sangiovese and 20% Merlot blend but it eventually reveals whiffs of prune and leather. The evolved, dense palate is more expressive, offering blackberry jam, licorice and black pepper alongside round tannins. Drink sooner rather than later to capture the remaining fruit and freshness.
Made country-style, this Zin is dry, medium-bodied and crisply acidic, with simple flavors of mashed cherries, raspberries and coffee. Nice with Italian fare.
Lots of ripe boysenberry, cranberry and sour cherry fruit to start, with a strong foundation of tar, espresso and bitter chocolate. This could pass for a Super Tuscan in a blind tasting. It unfolds slowly, with an interesting herbal/olive edge to it, and will reward additional cellaring.
This rich, ruby-colored red goes in the softer, smoother direction for a Pinotage, making it more appealing to American palates. The dry, spicy Pinotage character is still present, but it's rounded by a softer, fuller blanket of pretty fruit. Simonsig gets it right and this wine will pair well with grilled meats or can be enjoyed on its own. Hold for aging. Imported by Quintessential Family of Wines, LLC.
Very spicy, with candied orange peel and sour drop notes undercut by a lower honey-botrytis element. Appealing, if lacking the purity of the best from this hallowed vineyard. Drink now.
Inky, dark, charred and serious, and it only gets better as it opens with air. The palate has a smooth, deep, comfortable feel and the flavors are sweet, fruity, creamy and proper for Malbec. Chocolaty and rich on the finish. A very nice wine made for near-term drinking.
Still young in color and fruit, this is packed with black fruits and only the lightest hints of wood aging. That makes the wine very different from other vintage Colheitas or aged tawnies, with a style that is ripe and still fresh.
A very nice, elegant and complex Cab, showing firm mountain tannins that give a somewhat dry astringency to the rather sweet cherry, blackberry, mocha and cedar flavors. Its future is hard to predict. Now through 2010.
A blend of Cabernet Franc, Syrah, Merlot, and Cabernet Sauvignon, it's ripe and succulent with notes of cherry, vanilla and sweet spices supported by tart acids and tightly wound tannins.
This five-grape blend is heavy, oaky and green at its core. Aromas of cassis and raisin suggest ripe fruit, but the palate is acidic, with shaky balance. Flavors of blueberry and boysenberry are minty, while licorice tones and jammy weight define the finish.
This rich, wood-aged wine is impressive and well aged. It may be made from Merlot but it tastes thoroughly Portuguese with its dry tannins, mint flavors and intense ripe fruit. The tannins are cushioned by this juicy, rich fruitiness. The wine is ready to drink.
This blend of Incrocio Manzoni and Vermentino opens with bold floral intensity, plus solid background tones of peach and lemon mousse. It offers a creamy, soft mouthfeel that could stand up to white meat or shellfish.
Antero is a 100% expression of Merlot with green notes of eucalyptus, caper olive and herbs. There's a warm note of graham cracker as well and the wine ends with sweet, firm concentration.
A Robert Mondavi Cab with an Oakville address has always been a guarantee of quality, but we may have to rethink that equation, to judge by this semisweet, soft, simple '04. It tastes like something out of Paso Robles, a melted chocolate and cherry confection.
A smooth and ripe wine produced by the team of Cos d'Estournel. It is full and rich with black-plum fruits and velvet tannins. With fine acidity at the back, it has kept its freshness. Drink from 2022.

Fruity and bright, this is a lightly textured wine. With lemon and pink-grapefruit flavors dominant and a pale color, it is the crispest possible interpretation of a rosé. Drink this attractive wine now.
This very fruity wine oozes fresh apricot and elegant peach flavors. It's crisp and fragrant, a fine, ready-to-drink blend of Antão Vaz, Roupeiro and Arinto.
This is a well-made Rioja with generic plum and berry aromas that come forth in fruity, bouncy fashion. The palate is medium bodied, with standard berry fruit flavors and very little spice or complexity. A finish with buttery oak and vanilla qualifies as oaky for the level of fruit this wine is bringing.
This is pretty neutral on the nose, except for the saline, citrus and pear aromas. It feels juicy, fresh and average, with slightly sweet flavors of kiwi, lime and white grapefruit. It turns more pithy as it finishes.
With a sniff of noble reduction, this is a well-made robust wine, indicative of its historic estate and small-production values. A juicy core of broad plum, dark cherry and pomegranate wrap seamlessly around a fresh streak of minerality and rich texture.
There's not much pulp or grit here, but this easygoing (and well-priced) Chardonnay does offer distant aromas of stone fruit and honey. Citrus flavors and sharp acidity best describe the mouthfeel.

Caught between the outstanding '02 and '04 vintages, this is still an excellent vintage of The Octavius, but one to drink before the other two. The wine is open-knit, less structured and slightly lighter in body, with approachable spice, meat and blackberry flavors. Drink now–2013.
This is a pale-colored wine—lightly fruity and with a crisp clean texture. It is balanced with acidity and orange-zest flavor, giving the wine a refreshing lift at the end. This is an apéritif style, ready to drink now.
A brute of a wine, both in its immense flavors and its excessively weighty bottle. It has richness, full of concentrated sweet plum juice and dense tannins—very rich, very in your face.
Powerful, ripe fruit, now beginning to open up, is the dominant character of this wine. It's full in the mouth, packed with black plums and ripe damsons and finished with soft tannins and a slight warmth.
As part of a range of wines that are based on specific parcels of vines, this wine has also been partially wood fermented. Its richness and the touches of spice and toastiness give the wine a ripe rounded character. However, it is dry, crisply textured with a touch of tannin to give it structure. Drink now.
Aromatic with pepper and fresh-cut tobacco, well defined by herbal fruits and leafy tannins, this single-vineyard Malbec is stylish and balanced. What is missing is depth, but the balance and length are just right, and the wine does not overreach.
The acidity that is a characteristic of the vintage shows through in this wine. It clashes with the tannins to give a strangely unbalanced wine.
This is too ripe, with a disagreeable pruny taste. The wine is dry and full bodied, but is almost like a minor Port. The official alcohol reading is 14.8% by volume, but it tastes higher and hotter than that.
A pretty nose of delicate citrus, tropical fruit and floral tones is followed by some buttery base notes. The oak is showy but there are many who will like the creamy texture and spice it brings to the palate.
This light, fresh wine, with its concentration on raspberry flavors, has lifted acidity and an edge of bitterness. The tannins are there, but relatively subdued, so it's likely to age quickly.
This has flavors of black cherry, raspberry and red currant, with plenty of smoky, new French oak. It's flashy, but the finish is somewhat quick.
Pretty good wine for 10 bucks. It's dry and crisp, in the Monterey style, with good citrus fruit and mineral flavors that are accented by sweet oak.
An acid-driven wine, this has a palpable tartness, with feeble notes of raw wood, blueberry and smoke. Pairing this with a grilled pizza with a layer of tomato sauce could help tame the wild acids.
Here is tasty, forward, juicy fruit—a fresh berry mix of strawberry, blueberry and raspberry. There is firm acidity to balance the tannins, which bring just a hint of herb. Well done; it lacks only some depth in the finish to bring the score up.
The official alcohol is only 14.6%, not all that high, but the wine has a hot, Porty mouthfeel. It also tastes of overripe raisins, and finishes with a burning, chili pepper quality.
This wood-aged wine is smooth, with berry fruit flavors, solid tannins and a touch of mint. It should age well for the next few years, so drink from 2019.

This wine offers notes of herbs, tire rubber and sweet plum. The fruit flavors are sweet and broad backed by grippy tannins, finishing a bit short but still bringing plenty of appeal.
Inchinnan, the winery explains, is a Scottish word that means some little special place. Special indeed is this fruit, a three-clone estate vineyard selection. Blackberry and black cherry dappled with cinnamon is at the heart of it, supported with balanced natural acidity. A bit darker in color and flavor than the estate bottling, it's immediately enjoyable and structured for medium-term cellaring.
Winner, darkest wine of the year! Winner, highest alcohol table wine of the year! At 17.1%, the wine is incredibly rich, with massive cherry liqueur, cassis, fudgy chocolate and sweet licorice flavors. Hard to know how to deal with something like this, except to say it's really good at what it is.

A good, rich wine, brimming with ripe, fruity raspberries and cherries and lots of savory spices. Feels a bit rustic, with a sweet, caramelized finish. Drink soon.
Mostly it's clean and neutral smelling, but there is a bit of candle wax and peach to the nose as well. The palate is fresh and not too weighty, with melon, sweet apple and honeyed flavors. A solid wine, especially for the price range and origin. Don't expect miracles and it should be pleasing.
Juicy streaks of grapefruit and pineapple in this spry, dry Riesling are cut by laser-focused acidity and rocky edges of slate. It's approachable and fresh yet abundantly elegant. Drink now through 2018.
This blend of Arinto and Fernão Pires is soft and bland. Its light fruit and acidity feel open and ripe.
After 22 months in half new French oak, this blend of fruit from four widely separate vineyards inevitably kills the specificity. What's left is a quickly maturing wine with blueberry pie, clove and baking spices. Drink up.
Smooth and soft with strawberry and dried-fruit flavors, this is a dry rosé with plenty of ripe fruit to balance the acidity on the palate. The aftertaste is fresh and delicate.
There is a definite richness to this wine, the ripe white fruit and melon flavors aided by a judicious amount of vanilla and toast. That makes the wine seductive, but Laroche does not forget its Chablis origins and leaves enough room for a core of grapefruit, steel and tight acidity. Screwcap.
Textured richness with the flavor of juicy, yellow pears makes this a rounded but zesty Riesling with great, lemony focus.
Tan spice, like sandalwood, plays a leading role, along with a touch of Meyer lemon and marshmallow. Stone fruit notes are currently in the background, but may emerge more with time.
Richly fruity, this is a wine in progress. Its acidity and texture are still coming together to give a crisp wine with ripe fruit. Lemon and lime flavors will add a refreshing background. Drink from late 2017.
Beckstoffer To Kalon Cabs aren't always fabulous, because so many wineries source its fruit, but Knights Bridge has a great track record. This release is their best ever. Dry and soft in the mouth, it's drinkable now, yet so firm are the tannins that it will easily age. As for the flavors, they're incredibly complex in blackberries, black currant and licorice. Best now and through the next 10 years.

A fresh wine with red cherry fruits giving a bright character, the tannins soft and with attractive acidity. It is lightly textured and should be ready to drink in 1–2 years.

The wine's young acidity and structure are in place so it just needs time to age. Drink from 2020.

A very pretty, polished white wine. Slightly sweet in honey, it's crisp and clean in orange, gardenia flower and vanilla flavors. Nice on its own, or with fresh fruits.
Fermented in neutral Burgundian oak, this is crisp and stylish, and brings in tart Asian pear, jicama and white peach. Flavors are clean and razor sharp. No alterations, additions, or finings are employed—this is as noninterventionist as it gets.
Starts with hard, spicy, almost rubbery aromas, and while the palate is also a touch hard and lean, the flavors of cherry, cassis and wild berry are good and pure. Accents of herbal leafiness and vanilla are mellow and supportive, not dominant. Yet another solid Chilean Cabernet for under $15.
All Pepper Bridge vineyard fruit—62% Cabernet Sauvignon and 38% Syrah—this is right in line with the excellent 2006 Sayulita, which came from the Lefore Vineyard.

Good price for a deliciously drinkable Pinot Noir. It's silky and a little sweet in raspberries, brown sugar and bacon flavors. Easy to drink and at this price, it can be your house Pinot.
Dense and structured, this is a firm wine from the Santar estate. It is powered by its tannins and partnered with ripe black plum fruits. There is a feeling of tough rocks, a dry core that need some time. Drink from 2015.
Malbec is relatively new and rare in Washington, and it is still some years before most of the vines are mature, but the potential is there. This is 100% varietal, quite light, with forward fruit suggesting cherry, plum and berry. It's balanced with good acids, but there is not yet much depth or detail.

It's drinking well now but should only improve with additional time in the bottle. Best after 2018.
This wine has a strong herbal component of bay laurel and eucalyptus, girded in fully realized tannin and a juicy underbelly of cherry cola.
Black as night in the glass, this packs a bit of mystery behind its opaque coloring. There is an intriguing funk on the nose, mushroom-like with a lift of sagebrush but bordering on rich meat. The flavors begin with blackberry before the tannins overtake the mouth with ferocious viscosity—even more than two hours after being opened. There is something special about this wine, but it may take serious decanting to unlock the gate.
Clean and firm, with strawberry fruit and an earthy base. Hints of compost and tobacco came through in both the scents and flavors, while tannins were moderately coarse. Drink soon.
This wood-aged wine achieves a good balance between the toast and the bright citrus fruits. It's ripe, full of fruitiness and with a crisp texture that contrasts with the smoky backdrop. The aftertaste suggests the wine will benefit from another year's aging, so drink from 2016.
The nose tells of the crisp green freshness of tart apples, the palate counters this with more generous, riper but still very fresh fruit and a wonderfully balm-like creaminess. It all comes together on the midpalate: rounded but unobtrusive autolysis embraces the tart briskness and rounds it all out. Totally refreshing, and does not take itself too seriously.
Smooth and sophisticated with rich blackberry and plum aromas backed by oak-driven tones of spice and leather, this is a very rich expression of Barbera (that sees eight months in oak barrels). The overall effect is excellent and the mouthfeel culminates with bright tones of prune and crushed black pepper.
Although this is tight, acidic and tannic, the core is so rich, it should easily negotiate the next 5–6 years in a good cellar. The texture is of pure silk, and the flavors are rich in cherry, pomegranate and spice.

The Bully is a stiff, tannic, earthy and tight young wine, chewy and cherry-flavored; deep and hard and dense. Young as it is, the wine tastes of cassis, cherry, tobacco and oak. It mostly just needs a lot of time to breathe and a couple more years of bottle age.
On the rich side, this smooth wine discloses flavors of caramel and toasted almonds as well as fruit. It leaves a sweet feeling, rounded and ripe, finished with a touch of pepper and spice.
Rich and robust, this estate wine shines in milk chocolate, leather and smoky oak, its texture densely layered and soft.
This has a fantastically sugary, honeyed richness. But the flavors don't stand up to the sweetness. The blackberry flavor diminishes on the midpalate, and never recovers.

The best of the Archery Summit '03s, this light and tannic wine shows nicely ripened red fruits as well as hints of stone, bark, leaf and root. Good length and balance compensate for the lack of weight or richness.
Cidery, citric and jumbled on the nose and palate, this is barely cutting it. Briny, limited flavors of mealy citrus fruits finish flat.
This Tempranillo is leafy and leathery, with light raspberry aromas backed by thin plum and berry flavors. It's an aggressive, standard red wine that's neither here nor there.
Modest citrus, earth and almond notes come up from the glass, and continue in the flavors of this smooth, rounded, and straightforward wine. The balance is on the soft side, and the body is quite light.
Believe it or not, a wine made only from the south-facing side of the vines, which is the warmer side.

Feels rich and intense in the mouth, long on blackberry and cherry flavor wrapped in a mellow, soft texture.
The nose is loaded with mineral, pencil lead and blackberry notes. Generously juicy on the palate, this exudes youthful fruit backed by terroir-influenced notes. The tannins are structured and lightly sinewy yet soft all at once. The acidity is fresh, carrying the well-concentrated flavors of this chunky wine into a medium finish. This is a decidedly Old World in style, with evident fruit purity and provenance of place. Drink now and for three more years.
The tart, sour cherry fruit merely serves to support the leathery, earthy, spicy elements; the fruit never really takes charge. That said, the wine does have plenty to offer. The dried-spice aromas are an attractive blend of cracked black pepper, cinnamon and clove the mouthfeel is smooth and rich. Finishs long, with hints of espresso. —J.C.
A bit of a disappointment from this normally reliable producer, this 2015 rosé is cisp, tart and mildly sour, with a cidercast to its strawberry and citrus flavors. Drink up.
Vanilla-scented oak frames peaches and tropical fruit upfront, and then this wine picks up just enough crisp, citrusy flavors on the finish to give it a sense of balance and focus.
Richly textured wine that oozes jammy red fruits and ripe tannins. It has a good dry core followed by sweet acidity and a juicy berry character. The wine has some power and aging potential.
A sound Pinot Noir that's dry and silky. Shows gentle, jammy flavors of cherries, raspberries and sandalwood. Easy to like with grilled salmon, ham, sausage fritatta.
Bramble, wild cherry and touches of dill and bay leaf show on the nose of this bottling. The palate, which is thick with tannins though not too rich, shows damp and dewy flavors of marjoram and oregano, with cedar and black rock giving backbone to the tart cherry fruit.
Quite raisiny, with an overweight personality conveyed through the nose. The palate is tannic, with black cherry and cola flavors thickened up by a full dose of raisin. Very sweet on the finish, but also hard and baked. Still reasonably good but it's less well balanced than in previous vintages.
A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Teroldego, this delivers bold aromas of chocolate, spice, dark fruit, caramel and graham cracker. It feels linear and tight on the finish, and it offers firmly structured tannins that are surrounded by loads of ripe fruit and mocha flavors. Age this for 10 more years.
This is a vibrant, energetic Chardonnay that starts with fresh aromas of lemon zest, vanilla and spice and follows with appealing flavors of lemon, spice and citrus. Food- friendly and versatile.
Cherry and plum aromas are accented by buttery oak, leather and animal notes. Solid in feel with firm tannins, this warm-vintage Tempranillo is ripe, loamy and loaded with berry and cassis flavors. A lightly raisiny finish is friendly and round. Drink through 2019.
Opens with prickly, slightly stemmy aromas. The palate, however, is smooth and round, with chunkiness and roasted flavors of raspberry and plum that are true to warm-climate Pinot. Finishes warm, a bit toasty and chocolaty. Weighty but achieves balance with airing.

Aromatically intense, with notes of dried peach, orange cream and vanilla, this blend of Chardonnay, Gewürztraminer and Malvasia aims to push the envelope with its rich, almost-fluffy texture, and its penetrating red-berry, stone-fruit and citrus flavors. The grapes were crushed by foot, and skin contact was employed during fermentation. This is a decadent, unusual, oak-aged orange wine.
Delicious and ready to drink. The nose brims with lemon peel, minerality, saline and natural vanilla. In the mouth, it's healthy and ready to go, with citrusy lead flavors along with requisite green apple. Still fresh and crisp despite having been released a year ago. A wine to enjoy immediately.
Among all the 2011 single vineyard Pinots from Ken Wright, the Carter was the most difficult to assess. It showed reductive scents and remained stubbornly closed despite all efforts to give it a chance to open. Tight cranberry and cherry fruit peeked through a hard shell.
Thin in berry flavor, with a harsh mouthfeel and even some moldy tastes. It's bone dry on the finish.
Bright fruit notes of stone fruit, citrus and honey appear in an immediate and direct way and are followed by jasmine and chopped white pepper. Pair this luminous sparkler with fried fish sticks or breaded green olives.
This is a big, beefy and structured wine that at the same time is laden with fruit. A reminder of the tough schist soil of the Douro, the wine's mineral edge is balanced by the bright juicy fruit and acidity. With the tannins, this second wine from Duorum will age well, so drink from 2016.
The nose isn't very expressive but you can detect whiffs of adhesive bandage, medicinal herb, apple skin and mineral that carry over to the diluted, rather bitter palate. Brisk acidity underscores the wine's lean character.
91-93 Barrel sample. This is soft, open, but hiding very ripe, generous fruits. With flavors of tropical fruits, and of green plums, this builds on its fruit rather than on the underlying wood notes.
Delicate aromas of tomato vine, freshly cut grass and a whiff of tropical fruit emerge on this straightforward white. The vibrant, rather lean palate shows grapefruit, citrus zest and a hint of green melon alongside racy acidity.
Among the Uruguayan wines we've tried more than once, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Tannat and Merlot has integrity. It's light and herbal on the nose, with red fruit and spearmint aromas leading to a palate of cherry and red raspberry. Feelwise, it's tight and tough, but with food it will show fairly well.
This smooth, wood-aged blend of 80% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Syrah gives both spice and rich tannins. In the Provence warmth, they have blossomed together to give a wine that is ripe and full-bodied while keeping refreshing acidity at the end.
Lightly herbal, candied-berry aromas are good but not what you'd call exact or exciting. This has plenty of energy on a jumpy palate, while lightly resiny, woody flavors of candied red fruits finish tight and juicy.
Delicate aromas of lemon chiffon, green banana and mineral give this the opening you'd want. The palate is ripe and bold, but also limited to green-apple flavors. Healthy in the mouth, with a zesty, correct finish. This wine gets things right while not making a big statement. Imported by Republic National Distributing Co.

This wine is a blend of Grenache (44%), Counoise (36%), Syrah (10%) and Cinsault. Quite pale in color, it offers appealing aromas of raspberries and cranberries along with smoke. The flavors are light and lithe, putting a premium on purity, trailing slightly toward the finish.
Soft, overripe and raisiny sweet, this Cab Franc isn't offering much beyond a common, full-bodied red, with oaky notes. Drink up.
Inky dark in color, and made in a heavy, rich, extracted style, with prune, macaroon, black cherry and sandalwood flavors. Rather ponderous now, but dry and complex, and could evolve over the years.

Supertight yet smooth; this reserve-quality Sangiovese is exactly as it should be. Chocolate, raspberry and leather aromas lead to a corpulent but structured body veiling ultrapure red-fruit flavors. Neither tannic nor hard; hold for another 12 to 18 months. A Marc de Grazia Selection, various importers.
A blend of fruit from Schmitt, Evergreen and Oasis vineyards, this opens with appealing aromas of toast, candy corn, almond and pear. The pear and melon flavors are crisp and rounded, with a lightly creamy feel heightening the interest.

From the Aegerter domaine, this wine is full of spicy red fruits. It comes from a vineyard in the hills above Nuits Saint-Georges, and the cooler elevation shows in the acidity and fresh fruitiness. The wine is ready to drink.
A pear-flavored Pinot Gris from Yakima valley fruit. The fruit is limned with well-defined skin flavors, and the wine has a light tawny color. It starts off well, then stops short with a plastic, Band-Aid finish.
Tastes constructed and manipulated, with sugary-sweet pineapple and mango flavors and an acidity that seems unnaturally tart. Finishes with a candy, granola sweetness.

Plenty of leather, cassis, plum and tobacco aromas show on the nose of this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon wine.

The bouquet is redolent of stewed tomato, dried spices and lean red fruit, while the palate is thin and tastes like strawberries mixed with oak. The finish is the definition of light and easy, yet here a hint of pickled vegetable arises.
This large vineyard, in the hills of eastern Napa, is source to many wineries, and now Surh Luchel dips into the pot. This is a very good wine, dry and classically structured, with thick but finely ground tannins and ripe flavors of black currants and new French oak. A touch of asperity in the finish warrants against aging.
There's some sharpness in this wine, as well as a touch of unripeness. Still, it offers plenty of raspberry and cherry fruit, and is nice and silky, with plenty of sweet oak. Not likely to develop, so drink up.

This smells typical of coastal Chilean SB, meaning it's citrusy and green, but the nose seems a touch flat. Not so the palate, which is snappy and juicy. Flavors of grapefruit and passion fruit lead the way, with a backing of green bean and mild bell pepper controlling a crisp, fresh finish.
This dense and extracted Amarone offers jammy fruit aromas of blackberry and ripe cherry, followed by suede, spice and smoked mesquite. The mouthfeel is chewy and rich, making this a good pairing partner to hearty winter cuisine.

Sourced from the oldest vines in the vineyard, this lovely wine is scented with rose petals, cranberries and sour cherries. Those flavors continue in a light, elegant framework, that gains power and focus as it works its way through the palate.

Watery pineapple and peach flavors have a heavy jacket of oak-like smokiness. Acidity provides a clean mouthfeel.

The California appellation is because this Pinot is a blend of vineyards from Anderson Valley, Russian River Valley and the Central Coast.

The balance is great, and testifies to a mastery of the art of blending.
Wonderfully ripe notions of juicy, yellow pear rise from the glass. The same fruity freshness is joined on the palate by a good pinch of white pepper. While this is fresh and linear, it has a pleasant midpalate weight and a rounded, fruity appeal with real depth and peppery, citrussy echoes.

This best-of-barrels Chardonnay is oaky, offering waves of butterscotch and buttered toast that dominate the tart underlying flavors of pineapple and lime. It's certainly rich and well-structured, but quite oaky.
A densely tannic wine, dry with bitter dark cocoa and black fruit flavors. The concentration of fruit and tannin is impressive, and gives considerable complexity of fruit as it powers alongside the dryness. It needs aging for the rough edges to smooth out, probably 2–3 years.

This wine has a deep-gold color and aromas like apricots and toasted almonds. Flavors are almost as ripe as pineapple, while a creamy texture helps the fruit complexity linger on the finish.
More herbal than Three Corner. Tomatoes, rhubarb, cola, not quite ripe. Anise, cocoa powder. Dry, brittle. Showing its age, but interesting and layered.
Still developing, this big, rounded and rich wine bursts with spice and an opulent texture. Moving towards being glorious, it's structured with a dry core of spice while flaunting more tropical fruit flavors. Drink from 2017.

This wine is smooth while keeping all of its fresh wits about it. Citrus, red apple and quince flavors give both spice and ripe fruits. With its lively, tangy aftertaste, it does need to broaden out, so drink from 2016.
The blend here is 90% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Syrah, all from the Crawford vineyard. It carries some Port-like aromas of very ripe if not slightly over-ripe grapes, along with leafy components and accents of orange peel. A whiff of bourbon barrel sets up the sharp finish.
90-92 Barrel sample. This is packed with huge tannins and sweet, super-ripe fruit. It's tough at first because it is so powerful and alcoholic, but there is also a certain rough grace to it.
Grilled herb, dark spice, toast and leather aromas lead the nose. The palate is vigorous, marked by orange zest, dried cherry and thyme notes held together by tightly wound tannins.
Rich and round, this young wine is still showing the edges of its new oak, but offers crisp apple and pear flavors along with the vanilla, toast and hazelnut of the wood, and balanced acidity. The sharpness should smooth out with additional bottle age.
Dark and manly from the get-go, with aromas of melted brown sugar, black cherry and charbroiled beef. Next up you'll encounter fresh red fruit, peppy acids and enough body to provide balance and a perceived creaminess. Very easy to like.
Laced with acidity, this is a complex, structured wine with great freshness as well as a dry core of botrytis. It has a rich potential, closed at the moment but holding dense texture and balance between lemon and honey. Drink from 2019.
The wine has very ripe fruit that leaves a jammy character. Merlot sweetness dominates and the wine seems unbalanced maybe the result of recent bottling.

Old vine Pinot Gris? Sourced from the Jacob Hart vineyard, it's about 20 years old. Lightly beery, yeasty, with Asian pear and buttered apple providing the main flavor interest. This is an elegant, nicely balanced wine, with fruit and acid in perfect proportion.
This is a fruity wine, with tight acidity and a smooth texture. It's full of pear and green-apple flavors, and a warm, rich feeling. Very clean, ready to drink.
A little angular and sugary sweet, but it's soft enough, with a creamy, velvety texture and some ripe blackberry jam and chocolate candy flavors.
Vrucara represents a new, exciting page in the story of Sicily's most important indigenous grape, Nero d'Avola. The purity of the fruit comes through loud and clear, and the wine doesn't deliver that bittersweet finish you sometimes get. Instead, it shows cherry, spice and an elegant mineral tone.
Piercing aromas announce that this is no basic quaffer. The palate shows blazing acids that narrow everything down to citrus, lemon, underripe pineapple and Granny Smith apple flavors. While almost sour, it's not, with briney green fruit on a long, scouring finish.
A good, brisk Chardonnay, dry and honest. Not flashy or dramatic, it pulls its punches, with a deft touch of minerals, peaches and vanilla.
Good party Chard. Nothing too complex or subtle, just mixed tropical fruit with a hint of wood and sweet fruit-cocktail flavors.

Aromas of smoke, cream and herbs atop a ripe pineapple foundation. In the mouth, pineapple prevails again along with apple, toast and butterscotch notes. It's supple, and though quite fruit-driven, it's not at all sweet. The wine shows complexity and finishes long and light on its feet. Top Value.
Shows a dry, citrusy verve on the nose. Acids are in full force on the palate, which, with its citrus and gooseberry flavors, reminded me more of Sauvignon than of Chardonnay. Fattens up on the finish; a good, bargain-priced quaff. Imported by Beringer Blass Wine Estates.

Aromas of lemon drop, dried yellow flower, vanilla and butterscotch carry to the palate, along with toast, golden apple and a hint of savory herb. Balanced with bright acidity, it closes on a mineral note.

Much like the regular bottling from 2012, this comes across as rather rough and tannic, with rustic, earthy, herbal characteristics. Nonetheless, if you think of it as a pleasantly unfussy country wine, it's a good companion to a hearty winter stew.
While the wine is clean and refreshing, its texture lacks definition. It has a soft, bright finish.
Simultaneously snappy and creamy on the nose. The palate is a touch tangy and raw, but there's enough clean Garnacha fruit coming in raspberry/cherry flavors that it warrants more than a single pass. A little grabby and tight on the finish, but it rates as a good country wine. Imported by USA Wine Imports.
An unusual Merlot icewine, this is clear and quite lovely in the glass, with shades of sunset orange and mahogany, like burnished wood. It's unctuous and sugary in the mouth, with grainy flavors of sugarcane, strawberry jam and sweet cherry liqueur. Quite thick for an icewine, with a cloying finish.
Dry, tannic and a bit rustic in the mouth, with flavors of black currants, green olives, teriaki beef and sandalwood. A blend of nine varieties, and ready now.
For an inaugural effort, this coastal Pinot Noir is on the money. Dark and slightly charred-smelling on the nose, the wine is not shy. Full, oaky and moderately tannic, it shows roasted plum, char and toasty flavors in front of a brawny, oaky finish. Best from late 2015 through 2017.

There's great personality here thanks to the wine's bright fruit flavors, vibrant color and penetrating balsam notes that add depth and dimension. Bright cherry, blueberry, vanilla, sweet almond and menthol notes color a wine that will definitely pair beautifully with lamb, beef and most pasta dishes. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied but firm and showcases the pure fruit characteristics of Sangiovese.
Powerful and dense, this wine exudes the darkest of tannins as well as intense black fruit. Layers of richness and structure show in this Port's considerable ageability, while its acidity lends freshness. This is a wine that should be aged for 15 years or more.

This white blend from Lebanon has a nose of almonds, herbs and spicy fruit, as well as an unusual oxidized quality. A spicy, nutty palate with an assertive finish. Unique, but hard to love.
Aromas of wet rock, chewing gum and mild citrus fruits are straight down the middle. This feels modest, while cottony flavors of citrus and watermelon finish short and easy.
This is a bright wine with 90% Merlot. It has black-currant crispness and acidity. The tannins are light and the wine, ready to drink young and fruity, will be best slightly chilled.
Dark and chunky, both in sight and smell. Nevertheless, it's fairly nice on the palate, but it's soft. The black plum, cherry and licorice flavors are warm although not overly precise. Finishes with a decent kick as well as balancing flavors of fresh tomato and cherry. Imported by Opici Import Company.
This Zin tastes of smoke, oak and grilled meats, but has an odd acidity to it. It would be good paired with something off the barbecue.

Made using fruit sourced from vineyards on the highest terrace above the Tarn River, this fruity wine is made to be consumed young. It has a touch of minerality and some firm tannins, but the red berry fruit and flower note is already attractive. A blend of Négrette, Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec.
Soft, round and pleasurable, this Syrah-Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon blend would pair well with pastas or roasts. Bright cherry and blackberry flavors are followed by subtle leather and spice accents. The mouthfeel is fresh and fruity.

The wine is pure minerality, tightly woven into a tense structure and fruits that are still very young. It's complex, allying fruit with a texture that is steely and only developing slowly. It will be impressive as it ages. Drink from 2018.
Great balance and a charming lighter character make this lightly floral wine especially enjoyable. The orange blossom aromas and ripe melon flavors are vivid but not heavy as they weave through a smooth yet crisp texture and linger on the finish.
Dusty aromas come with notes of ham and tropical fruits. This is more blah than focused. Tropical fruits, grapefruit and pickle brine comprise the flavors prior to a salty, slightly green finish.

Mint and tannins feature in the initial flavor, then it opens out to show delicious blackberry juice fruit. The tannins are dry but integrate with acidity to give more serious aspect to this balanced wine.

Seems slightly confected and perhaps a little off-dry, but it exhibits tasty cinnamon and baked-apple flavors and a dash of peppery spice on the finish. Drink now. Imported by McWilliam's Hanwood Estate.
The 2012 and 2013 vintages were both strong in southern Australia, so some of the realistically priced Pinots from South Australia and Victoria are worth stocking up on. This is a good example, showing hints of acacia blossoms, red berries, cola and brown sugar wrapped in supple tannins. Drink now through 2018.
This is a fruity wine showing a touch of wood aging alongside juicy red fruit flavors. A blend of Touriga Nacional, Syrah and Alicante Bouschet, this wine has a bright youthful color and fresh acidity at the end. Drink now.
Berry and cherry aromas register as soupy and flat. Like the nose, this feels flat, chewy and dense. Stewed, rubbery prunes and plums finish with a fig-like note and rubbery tannins.
Nice and dry, with smoky oak framing tropical fruit and peach flavors, finishing with Asian spices. With its crisp acids and rich fruitiness, it's a natural for shellfish or creamed chicken.
From a terrific, old-vine site in the heart of the southern-lying appellation, this is a mild-mannered, juicy wine, structured and balanced despite the abundance of ripe red fruit. Cinnamon and pepper complement the restrained nature of the brambly cherry.
One of the trio of Dumangin wines around a single variety and named after family forebears, this is a rare pure Pinot Meunier. It shows a delicate softness, perfumed with ripe, smoky apricot fruit, ready to drink now.

From a small appellation near Bonny Doon that this family has farmed for half a century comes this zesty wine, with aromas of seared lemons, caramelized nectarine, browned butter and hard apple candy. The palate shows warm apples, roasted almonds and a shred of iodine, finishing with dried apricot and pressed white flowers.
This is from Dan Morgan Lee's own vineyard. It's in the coolest northwest part of the appellation, near its boundary, and is more acidic and elegant than his purchased Pinots further south. The 2004 vintage was blazingly hot, and the grapes loved it. Big in cherry, cola, leather and spice flavors, it's a wine to savor. Best now through 2008.
A pungent feline nose includes scents of melon, passion fruit and white grapefruit. Chunky and round on the palate, this has acidic cut to it, while flavors of tangerine, grapefruit and mango are workmanlike.
An austere, savory Zin from Amador, one of the smaller-production Zinfandels from Renwood and it shows. Firm tannins, dusty black fruit and spice—a good option for Sierra Foothills Zin fans.
Red berry flavors and a soft-but-spicy texture give this now-mature wine some ripeness. It has a raspberry jam character that's laced with acidity; its tannins are soft and mature.
Alvarinho is hardly native to the Douro, hence the regional designation of this fruit-driven wine. It's fresh, crisp and creamy with just a touch of yellow fruits to go with the apples. It's ready to drink now.
Compared to Cline's Bridgehead, this Zin is softer and much simpler. There's not much going on, except for high alcohol and a Zinny, berry character.
This unique Sauvignon Blanc has gooseberry aromas and flavors suggestive of those Marlborough wines from New Zealand, but also a pickleweed note that veers into cat pee. Yet it's not quite dry, but has a honeyed finish. Try with a spinach salad with shrimp and pink grapefruit.
Exotic pineapple and melon fruit aromas lead on this full-bodied white. On the palate, curvy melon and vanilla are punctuated by citrus and a spray of minerals. Assertive with body that can handle bigger flavors, like seafood, poultry and fruit.
Too soft and sweet. It shows rich flavors of cherries, raspberries and chocolate, but that sugary finish is out of place in a table wine.
Beyond the hard edge of tannins, this is an extracted wine, with dark chocolate and wood flavors. The hints of fruit bring out a more gentle black currant ripeness, although they are far from developing well.
From a new, small producer devoted to 100% Zinfandel, this soft, grippy wine offers a hint of menthol on the nose and muted aromatics. The finish is ripe though tempered by good acidity.
Cherry cola and cardamom scents start the experience with this blend. A boost of Petite Sirah contributes licorice flavor to the midpalate, and a chocolate cake with mocha frosting flavor to the finish. There's ample grip to the strong tannins, so even though it's already five years old, it will continue to smooth through 2016.
This blend of Zinfandel, Carignane and Petite Sirah tastes like one of those regional wines you discovered on vacation. You remember the sweet cherries, how dry it was, and how perfect with that chicken cacciatore. Shows up the promise of Lodi.
A ripe and rich wine that is structured with tannins and layers of wood. It has spice and black-fruit flavors that make it a rich wine with potential. Drink from 2018.
This is a good, full-bodied, dry Cabernet that delivers with plenty of varietal personality. Shows very ripe, concentrated blackberry, cherry and currant flavors, with plenty of sweet oak, and is tannic enough to develop over the next 4–6 years. Easy to find, with 12,000 cases produced.
Classic Albariño aromas of sea brine, tropical fruits, lees and dust precede a minerally lemony palate with tangy flavors of lemon, lime and gooseberry. This is a fresh clean example with a long stony citrusy finish.

A fresh, very strawberry and plum skin flavored Pinot Noir from Irancy, a small area near Auxerre and close to Chablis. The wine has some weight because of the vintage, which gives ripeness and an edge of rusticity. It's certainly more than just a curiosity.
This is a sort of junior version of the winery's All In Claret, and it suffers from the same sugar problems. The alcohol is moderate, but it's almost as candied sweet as a dessert wine.
Frescobaldi's Pinot Grigio proves to be a well-constructed and composed wine with green fruit like kiwi and honeydew  backed by a pine resin, cut-grass quality. Silky smooth in the mouth. Imported by Folio Fine Wine Partners.

This Primitivo bears a dark, inky color, with bold aromas of blackberry jam and exotic spice. Oak-driven flavors of tobacco, cinnamon, toasted nut and carpenter's shop are almost too much. However, the wine does end on a sweet, fruity note.
Another Bulgarian surprise, with pleasant cigar box and earth flavors wrapped in supple tannins and topped with cassis. Nicely balanced for near-term drinking.

Beautiful black-cherry aromas and flavors make this wine direct and focused. A slightly gripping texture of fine-grained tannins and good acidity keeps the mouthfeel lively. It has a wonderful sense of purity and focus.
This wine presents aromas of flowers and purple fruit that are almost animalistic in nature. The palate boasts bright acidity and firm but far from inaccessible tannins. It's the purity, however, that most impresses.
An appealing blend of blackberry, anise and smoked meat aromas is followed by flavors of smoked meat and pepper in this savory Syrah blend. The slightly oily mouthfeel and rich flavors are cut by acid and tannins that give it balance.
Nicely focused, with a core of wild strawberry and black cherry, this bears herb and pepper highlights common to Oregon Pinot. It has a nice mouthfeel and is balanced throughout.
Young, dark, and smells hard and unyielding. Oak, black stone fruits and berries. Very extracted, jammy and acidic. Sweet in fruit and oak. Somewhat astringent. Needs time, or extensive decanting.
Blackberry aromas are outweighed by heavy, creamy, oak-driven scents of chocolate, vanilla and mocha that seem more forced than natural. This is chunky on the palate, with flavors of vanilla and milk chocolate blending with sour plum and berry notes.
From the northern Vinho Verde region of Monçao and Melgaço, this finely textured wine is young, although already delicious. Its texture brings out the minerality from the granite soil, giving the wine a zesty character. The fruit bursts out of the glass: delicious citrus and sliced apples and a great burst of acidity. Drink from late 2017.
In this lively, delicately balanced wine from an exceptional vineyard, an exuberance of pear and tangerine plays on the palate, buoyed by focused minerality. With just the right touch of ripeness and richness, it ends with a suggestion of lemon custard.
This is the very definition of a modern cult-style Napa Cabernet. It's extraordinarily rich and flavorful in blackberries, blueberries, cassis and chocolate, while the jacket of tannins is as soft and velvety as modern winemaking can achieve. It doesn't seem likely to age beyond 2015.
Firmly tannic, it's based entirely on the rich structure of Alicante Bouschet. It has an interplay of dark fruits, spicy wood-aging and acidity. They are combining well to give a well-structured wine that's ripe and juicy. Drink from 2017.
Impressively structured, packed with dark, heavy tannins, this is an aromatic Port. The initial black plum fruit and spice flavors are dominated by the structure, promising a good aging potential.
Winemaker Rich Cushman notes that this is a “field blend” of Pinot Gris, Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc from this vineyard's single bearing acre. It is a delightful wine, and the three grapes all contribute to the mixed scents of grass, citrus and melon; and the fresh fruit flavors that run to cool green and yellow fruits and berries. A nice finish suggests fresh-cut cantaloupe.
Clos de los Siete, the amalgmated product of Michel Rolland's Uco Valley wine commune, is rich, round and ripe, with deep aromas and trimmings like polished oak and minerality. The wine is proper, medium to full in size, and full of blackberry, plum and cocoa. No hiccups, pure fruit and complexity make this stellar for the price.

Full bodied and opulent in classic Meursault style, this ripe, yellow-fruited wine is full of ripe fruits layered in wood notes. There's a sense of power and generosity throughout. It's a wine that will develop over the medium term, so drink from 2015.
Oaky, resiny, briny aromas of apple and popcorn set up a high-acid palate with fragmented resiny notes. Flavors of briny apple, lemon and oak but also fresh and citrusy.
Strong, caramelized oak stars in this dry, rather one-dimensional Cabernet. Despite some black currant, anise and mocha flavors, it's like drinking toothpicks.
Densely-colored, dark wine. Somewhat sullen and closed nose, yet on the palate, blackberry coulis aromas lead to aged and charred steak flavors. This is a moderately complex wine with a briefly lingering finish. Leather and dried earth notes suggest this wine has evolved to benefit but that it should be consumed now to 2014.
Made from the oldest vines in the winery's vineyard, Terre Rouge's Sentinal Oaks Pyramid Block is usually their best Syrah, and so it is in the 2005 vintage. It's a beautiful wine, soft, rich and opulent. The flavors of blackberries, ground black pepper, cherries, raspberries, chocolate, coffee, cola and Asian spices flood the mouth, leading to a dry, anise-tinged finish. Best now and for a few years.
This attractively pale-colored rosé has ripe red fruits and crisp acidity in just the right proportions. It is soft, fruity with a lightly crisp texture and a bright, lively aftertaste. Drink now.
The Zuc di Volpe line boasts an exceedingly attractive expression of Pinot Bianco that is both aromatic and textured at the same time. The wine sees some oak aging that has helped shape aromas of almond, honey and fresh peach.
With a bright purple color and integrated but potent aromas of oak, mineral, schisty earth and black fruits, this is a rock-solid yet approachable and delicious wine. A structured palate is firm and braced by fine acidity, while flavors of wild herbs, licorice and blackberry finish with a touch of molasses as well as brown sugar and anise. Drink through 2019.
A blend of 90% Grenache and 10% Syrah, all from vines averaging 80 years of age, this is a stupendously concentrated wine that still possesses nuance and complexity. Exotic spices—notably lavender and clove—scent the bouquet, while the huge palate boasts layers of plum fruit and thick, velvety tannins. Drinkable now, but probably at its best after 2012.
A dry, medium-bodied Pinot that shows very ripe fruit, easy tannins and a crisp bite of acidity. The flavors are delicious, all black cherries, sweet rhubarb tea, cola, vanilla and cinnamon. It's a wine you'll find yourself reaching for a second and a third time.
From one of the Napa Valley's most historically famous sites, this Cab delivers a testament to gamy blackberry and blueberry alongside complex cassis, clove and black licorice. Full bodied and richly concentrated, it's also soft and well integrated, entirely pleasurable now, with years to go in terms of structure and body. Cellar through 2027 and possibly beyond.
Riserva S. Bernardo has a fabulous nose of dusty mineral interwoven with dried cassis, natural rubber, licorice, anise and country earth. But it's that extraordinary mineral note—think granite, black slate and pencil shaving—that really sets it apart. The wine is firm, well-structured and complex.
Soft, with a severe cut of acidity slicing through modest blackberry-jam flavors.
This is a Zweigelt with an identity crisis that thinks it may be Pinot Noir. It's elegant and silky, with a gentle tannic touch, refreshing acidity and restrained but evocative redcurrant and cranberry fruit. Overtones of peony and iris make this more intriguing, while there is substance despite its light body. This is delicious now, but will reward cellaring for one to two years to let earthy, tertiary flavors develop. Drink from 2014.
This structured wine has a great weight of fruit behind its firm tannins. Juicy acidity gives a delicious, fragrant and ripe character. Drink this wine from 2016.
This is a rich wine that is full of generous fruit. It has a smooth texture with its broad red-fruit character that is gently lifted by acidity. Ripe and with a soft texture, the wine is ready to drink.
Strawberry and red raspberry are the themes here along with an underlying note of fresh hay. It's dilute, but pleasant in the mouth, winding down to a final note of lemon peel. Should be drunk up before 2011.
This offers exceptional concentration and power. Sweet strawberry fruit is dense and detailed, bringing hints of spice and milk chocolate into play through a long, utterly satisfying finish.
This winery has made its mark over the years exclusively with blended wines, yet here is a single-varietal, single-vineyard offering. The aromas are expressive with notes of black cherry and high-toned herbs along with spice accents. The dark fruit and licorice flavors are tightly wound with a core of firm tannins and lively acids.
Despite its name, this is in fact a rosé, which is light orange-pink in color. It is bone dry, mineral, taut and crisp. Red currant and lime flavors mingle with a tight acidity and totally dry aftertaste. Disgorged June 2012.
Round, melony and pleasant, with tropical/floral aromas. Flavorwise, it's all about medium-intensity melon and lychee, and as Torrontés goes this one is likable and well made. It covers the tropical fruit bases and adds in some peppery dryness on the finish.
Fresh, vivid fruit flavors pop from this light-colored, well-balanced, mouthwatering wine. Ripe pear, crisp apple and a touch of baking spices mingle on the palate and linger on the finish.
Rose, chopped mint, red berry and new leather aromas slowly take shape on this fragrant red. Elegant and precise, the palate delivers Marasca cherry, raspberry, licorice and pink peppercorn set against fine-grained tannins and bright acidity. A coffee note backs up the close. Drink 2023–2033.
Very perfumed in style, this is classic Gewurztraminer. It is full of candy shop flavors and slightly blowsy. It doesn't take itself too seriously, and it's ready to drink now.
Here is an easy and straightforward Falanghina (with some Coda di Volpe) that offers sweet notes of yellow candy, peach fuzz, caramel and brown sugar. The wine is easy and fresh and could be served with hors d'oeuvres.
Rich, ripe and flavorful, this mountain Barbera will age for a long time. That's a simple function of its balance. It's very tannic, high in acidity, and those blackberry and cherry flavors are just waiting to star. Nice now if you need a big, tight young red wine, but should hold for a decade.
A delicate wine that is completely ready to drink and needs to be consumed now before it ages further. The fruit has developed a secondary, animal character, the tannins starting to dominate with their dryness.
Coming in at the less-oaked end of the California Chardonnay scale, this presents aromas of slate, graphite and cut grass. It delivers those same flavors to the palate as well as some green pear. It's restrained, yet still New World.
Lots of fruit in this rustic, oaky wine. It has flavors of blackberries, cherries and mulberries. Drink now.
This is labeled as Cabernet but is a Bordeaux-style blend that includes small percentages of Merlot, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc. At the moment the wine is not especially expressive. There are hints of peppery herb in the nose, lightly ripe red fruits, and a pleasing, buttery finish.
The winery has held this wine back for more than four years before releasing it, with excellent results. However tannic it might have been, it's now a softly lush, complex wine, even a dramatic one. Filled with blackberry, dark chocolate, tangerine zest, violet, anise, leather and tobacco flavors, it's a big wine, but a completely satisfying one.
This appealing blend of Touriga Nacional and Aragonez gives a fresh, crisp red fruited wine. Just the right amount of acidity produces a light, bright aftertaste.
This is a rare dessert wine from the Vinho Verde region. It's packed with flavors of currant, lemon honey and orange peel. With its great sense of acidity, it is both sweet and deliciously refreshing.
Takes the firm, flinty steeliness and tangy acidity of Edna Valley fruit to new heights, with powerful yet nuanced Key lime, kiwi and tart green apple flavors and a rich, creamy, not-too-oaky mouthfeel.
Made from equal parts Grenache Blanc and Viognier, this wine shows tangerine jam, lime, honeysuckle and vanilla flavors, brightened with brisk acidity. It's dry, with refreshingly low alcohol. A good white wine to drink now with a wide variety of foods.
The majority of the grapes for this lithe, elegant wine come from the Zio Tony Vineyard, with the remainder from Red Car Estate. Cool-climate in its high-toned acidity and delicate features of rose and lavender, it's smooth, soft and vibrantly shaken with white pepper, a classic call-out to the Northern Rhône.
Hard oak and chemical scents crowd out the limited fruit aromas in this Pinot Noir that feels wiry and high in acid. Flavors of plum and currant are modest, while the finish is low on flavor and high on tang and juicy acidity.
This is a sophisticated effort that opens with lively aromas of butterscotch, candied fruit, papaya, pineapple, vanilla and ripe apricot. It's a beautiful wine, with a bold and opulent mouthfeel and a finish that lasts minutes.
This Pinot kicks off with a burst of mouthwatering lime acidity, before flavors of cherry, cranberry and cola settle in. The palate finishes richly with some new French oak, making it a great companion with steak.
Cottanera interprets Etna through the lens of international grape varieties like Syrah. Sole di Sesta shows chewy berry and smoked bacon overtones that are characteristic of the grape, with enhanced mineral finesse that is typical of volcanic soil.
A good Grenache from the standpoint of a dry red wine. The wine is extraordinarily rich in cherry fruit, and is nicely silky, with firm, juicy acidity. Neutral oak adds just a touch of smoke. Drink now.
A simple, straightforward Sauvignon Blanc this is ripe with peach, pear, Meyer lemon and lime flavors, but brightened and cleansed by brisk acidity. The price is fair for what you get.
Ripe and heady in black currants, cassis liqueur, blackberry pie and mocha flavors, this Cab's high alcohol gives it a soft mellow mouthfeel, as well as some heat in the finish. With velvety tannins, it will pair well with a great steak.
Smooth and soft, this is a ripe, white-peach-flavored wine. It has an attractive tang of orange zest and a note of almond, and its bright acidity adds balance. With its fruitiness, it's ready to drink, but it will mature over 2–3 years.
Dry and high-alcohol voluptuous, with appealingly forward cherry, blackberry and cola flavors, and a complex, spicy finish. The rich tannins make it perfect with flank steak and short ribs.
Restrained on the nose, this blend of 41% Grenache, 32% Syrah and 22% Mourvèdre offers black plum, milk chocolate, purple flower and vanilla on the nose. Black peppercorns show strongly on the palate along with black-plum skins and cola, but this still needs some bottle age to emerge to full potential.
Earthy notes of tree bark and licorice root lift the cassis and black plum aromas and flavors. Simple but well structured with medium tannins and a solid finish.
Overly sweet and lacking in vibrant acidity, this Cab has candied flavors of cherries and raspberries. It's a clean, simple wine for drinking now.
The wine is closed up at this stage, just showing structure and only hints of dark fruit. However, there is a feeling of power and a dense texture that need time to open up. The result is a wine full of potential, finishing with some juicy fruitiness.
A handful of Petit Verdot adds power and color to this wine, which opens in a dusty, rich bouquet of dark cherry. Compressed tannins give way to a concentration of pomegranate and cassis, the fruit grown predominantly on Spring Mountain. The finish captures mountainside minerality. Drink now through 2020.
This is 58% Grenache, 39% Syrah, and 3% Tempranillo. It's a real fruit salad of a wine—fresh and loaded with strawberries, cherry candy, cola and cream. Forward and fruit-driven, it's enormously appealing and ready to drink right now.
A new wood aged selection of vines from Château Haut Beyzac, a property being restored by Pennsylvanian Daren Miller and his French in-laws. It is delicious, elegant, offering classic black currant flavors of Bordeaux, but with an extra depth and richness. Fine, elegant acidity to finish.
90-92 Beautifully perfumed wine, the tannins relatively gentle. It has packed weight, as well as ripe berry fruits.
Despite looking gold and mature, this PG exceeds expectations courtesy of waxy, baked-apple aromas and a full but balanced mouthfeel. Spiced apple, apricot and burnt orange flavors finish long due to core acidity. Drink immediately.
Made from various St. Helena vineyards, with some additions from eastern Oakville, it expresses all the beauty of Napa Valley Cab. The flavors of blackberries, black currants, chocolate, licorice and smoky cedar are absolutely delicious. Yet the wine possesses structure, not the easiest thing to achieve with a 100% Cabernet this rich. The wine should age well through 2020, but there's no reason not to drink it now.
Richly textured and flavorful, this gentle wine has pretty cherry and blackberry notes, as well as eathier ones of tobacco and herbs. Oak adds sweetness, but is not heavy. Some astringent tannins suggest modest aging possibilities.
Tasters pegged apples, anise, crème brûlée and cinnamon in the lively nose of this rich wine—one that also sparked some controversy. The straight-ahead flavor profile is appealing, with solid apple, clove and butterscotch offset by the attractive anise streak. But is it native yeast or heavy malolactic fermentation that's responsible for the mixed feelings some panelists expressed? Concerns were noted about a dairy-like note on the nose and also a slick, yet gummy texture. Nevertheless, the winning aromas and flavors kept the overall take positive.
90–92  A big, solid effort with spicy fruit, exotic herbs and denseness. But the fruit is still fresh to give the wine a final lift.
Spelt is a mature and richly extracted Montepulciano d'Abruzzo, with deep tones of black tobacco, ripe berry, prune, plum and spicy rum cake. It exhibits soft texture and a plush, rich finish.
Not for fans of rich Chardonnays, this is a very dry, acidic bottling. It's more about clean mouthfeel and scour than hedonism. What fruit there is suggests limes, pears and brisk minerals, while smoky oak and lees contribute toasty, buttery, creamy notes. A distinguished and elegant wine that defines cool-climate coastal conditions. Grows more complex and interesting as it warms in the glass.
Rounded melon, grapefruit juice, lemon chiffon, gray slate and a bit of white pepper swirl into a distinctive nose on this wine by the San Luis Obispo-based producer. The palate is tight and bright, though a bit sour with apple-peel flavors.
Mike Dobrovic, winemaker at Mulderbosch, coaxes a blend of open rich fruit with a spine of steel from his fruit. The wine is definitely New World in style with its creamy wood flavors, yet it also has the ability to age, which is more Burgundian in character.
The Roux family, based in Saint-Aubin, is a specialist in wines from the villages in the hills above the Côte de Beaune. This full-bodied wine is still closed, wood and peach flavors still emerging. Keep it for 1–2 years to reveal the richness.
Strawberry, vanilla and smoke overlay deep blue fruit in this seamless, velvety wine. Light-bodied, it wields vibrant acidity and moderate, spicy highlights.
Fragrant white flower, honeydew melon, tomato vine and hay aromas all come together in the glass. The vibrant palate shows pink grapefruit and tangerine alongside a vein of mineral.
Smells earthy, murky and a little raisiny, and then in the mouth it scratches with grating tannins in support of floral cherry and tart red fruit flavors. Finishes sort of hollow and sour; standard issue at best.
Young and a bit fiery at first, but give it time in the glass and it unfolds in a way that you would never expect for a wine of this price. Medium-bodied without any harshness, it has Mencía's typical soft tannins and berry compote flavors backed by a touch of char and vanilla. A super good wine that proudly represents Bierzo at the value level.
This satèn boasts a pretty, brilliant golden color and aromas of dried apricot, peach, white stone and banana. More grandiose and opulent in style, it has great succulence, fine acidity and playful perlage.
Green and lean Garnacha, with tobacco, celery and other vegetal aromas. Chunky in the mouth, but rather sour tasting, with grassy, green fruit and bite. Not a prime-time player.
Vecchia Modena is a landmark label in the world of Lambrusco and is often seen as one of the easiest and most straightforward expressions of the ruby-red sparkling wine. It shows a light cherry color with bright raspberry and blueberry flavors capped by white foam.
A glorious, ripe, spicy wine that keeps its origins clear with its tight edge of stone and steel, which brings the acidity under the sweet pear and yellow berry fruits. With its rich, round finale, this is a firm but opulent wine. Imported by Vin Divino.
Fruity and apple flavored, it has a creamy texture, followed by an attractive hint of spice and a tight line of crisp acidity.
Aromas recall ripe berry and blue flower with a balsamic note. The structured but seemingly weightless palate delivers layers of ripe raspberry, juicy dark cherry, clove and licorice alongside firm, fine-grained tannins. An intense mineral note signals the close. Drink 2017–2027.
This is a rounded and rich wine, packed with citrus fruits and delicious acidity. Lemon and orange-zest flavors balance well with the mineral texture. Drink from 2018.
Sassicaia has been showing amazing results in recent years, and the 2009 vintage opens with all the intensity and beauty you should expect of Italy's flagship super Tuscan. Notes of blackberry, soft spice, chocolate, espresso and a touch of rosemary oil make for a beautiful bouquet. The mouthfeel is long, supple and rich. Drink after 2020.
Initially herbal, it then rounds out in the mouth, with white- and green-fruit flavors combined with a soft texture. Ready to drink now.
So insanely rich and ripe, it's practically a food group in itself. Floods the mouth with blackberry and cherry jam, cassis liqueur, milk chocolate and sweet oak flavors, in a texture that's soft and creamy. It's almost too much of a good thing, and would benefit from a little restraint.
This is an elegant, cinnamon-spicy Cabernet from Corey Beck, the head winemaker for Francis Ford Coppola. Balanced and soft, it has a texturally pleasing mouthfeel of velvety herb and cassis and a fully realized, lingering finish.
This is a thick and brawny Brunello that shows a lot more heft and personality than some of the weaker expression from the 2005 vintage. Fattoria Scopone presents a rich and textured wine with ripe notes of cherry liqueur and blackberry followed by firm, gritty tannins.
There is a touch of spice on this wine, along with flavors of crisp citrus and green apple. Fruity and bright, this is already drinkable, and it finishes with a tang of lemon zest.
This soft and fruity wine has open white fruit and citrus flavors. It is light and crisp with just the right amount of acidity. Coming from a warm year, it is richer than in other vintages, smoother and riper. Drink now.
Packaged in an easy screwcap bottle, Centine rosé delivers fragrances of sweet strawberry and raspberry over an easy, but streamlined texture. Pair this fresh wine with spicy Indian samosa.
From the producer's family estate site planted in 1982 on Eastside Road, this is a nuanced elegant expression of the variety, earthy and pungent in baked bread. Baked plum, strawberry and dried herb are accented by forest floor and a rich hit of maple.
From a 6-acre parcel of grand cru vines, this blanc de blancs is still very young. Its pink grapefruit and mineral characters accent a core of lively acidity. It needs time, another five years at least, but is already an impressive wine.
A sprightly, spritzy wine, with fresh strawberry, a touch of caramel and light berry acidity. There is some softness, particularly at the end, with a flavor of boiled candies.
With 30% new oak, the wood stands out, giving the wine vanilla and buttered toast notes. Crisp acidity kicks in right away, giving sour candy flavors of pineapples and lemons, while the underlying Arroyo Grande terroir gives this Chard a minerally tug. Dry and elegant, it's a wine to drink now, with decanting.
Though given extra bottle age prior to release, this remains a bit stiff and tannic. Floral highlights and smoky tannins book-end the black fruits. Deep cassis and a bit of licorice wind through the finish. This is a blend of 78% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Petit Verdot, 8% Merlot and 4% Cabernet Franc.
This open, soft wine brings out some of the ripe fruit flavors of the vintage. It has attractive melon and apricot fruit along with a tight streak of mineral acidity. It's ready to drink now, although it will be better from 2017.
Spiced cherry, brandied plum and overt but high-quality buttery oak aromas open this red-fruit-driven Malbec from the heart of the Uco Valley in Mendoza. Flavors of toasted, creamy oak rest easily on top of kirsch and red plum flavors, while chocolaty, toasty, spicy flavors direct the finish. Drink this well-oaked, expressive heavyweight now through 2020.
Oaky and leesy, with a range of fruits from apples through peaches and pineapples, and tingly with dusty spices and acidity. This is a clean, food-friendly Chard, not too sweet
Applesauce aromas are open and inoffensive, and the palate is wet and refreshing, with crisp, dry green apple and generic white fruit flavors. As a brut nature, it makes sense that the finish would be wet, lean and taste like lime-infused soda water.
Terrale translates as “product of the earth,” and that’s about all one can say about this wine. The grapes used are Catarrato, a white variety indigenous to Sicily, and the ubiquitous Trebbiano. A light apple nose starts it off, and the structure is good, with adequate acids. However, the finish is short and lacks flavor.
Spicy, floral aromas announce a dry Pinot Gris, bringing in crisp acidity as well as a richer fruit texture. The fruit is attractive, with pear and mango flavors, finishing with a lift. Screwcap.
Named for the vineyard's address on Live Oak Road, this tasty blend holds 39% Syrah, 28% Grenache, 19% Counoise and 14% Mourvèdre. It delivers aromas of scarlet red rose petals, crushed clove and cherry pie. The fruit flavors are so deep they border on blueberry, set against a tannic backbone, yet proving quite light and drinkable.
Rich, ripe and medium sweet, this is characterized by its pure fruit flavors, which are dominated by notes of orange zest, honey and crisp lime. It has a tight, bright texture, leading to a fine, fragrant and spicy finish.
Here is a finely crafted Chardonnay that shows soft aromas of apricot and peach backed by mild tones of melted butter and toasted almond nut. This wine is characterized by extreme balance and structure that makes it perfect for white meat or shellfish.
Coming in at 159g/L residual sugar, this wine is über-aromatic, with notes of dried apricot, pineapple, flowers, and honey, showing layer of complexity. Given the richness of the aromas, the palate is surprisingly deft and light on its feet, displaying a lot of grace and detail to the sugary-sweet flavors.
Subdued aromas of red apple and melon are followed by a dry, medium-bodied palate with a tart, drawn-out finish.
An okay wine that's light in color and aromatics, traceable in part to its cooler-climate heritage (95% of the grapes were grown in Mendocino, the rest in Sonoma, Monterey and Santa Barbara), which does give it some subtly pleasing red fruit and spice notes. But 2008 was also for much of Mendocino a vintage from hell and this wine may in truth be reflecting that year's challenges.
Fresh and fruity, this straightforward red offers aromas of ripe dark-skinned berry, licorice and leather. The soft, juicy palate doles out dried blackberry and spiced blueberry alongside round, smooth tannins.
This is an absolutely charming, lighter-style dry wine that has a translucent ruby color, fresh raspberry and red cherry aromas and mild but vivid flavors buoyed by good acidity and very moderate tannins. Light body doesn't mean wimpy, though, as this gem has good depth and a lingering finish.
From the cool 2010 vintage, this the blend of 80% Roussanne and 20% Viognier comes across as slender and yeasty, simple and tart.
Interesting enough on the nose, with aromas of cotton candy, charcoal, lemon peel and coffee. The palate deals the usual suspects for Cabernet: cassis, plum, tobacco and herbal accents. Competent as a whole and probably a bit above average.
With huge amounts of graphite, toast, wood grain, blueberry and blackberry aromas, this Cabernet Franc-led blend (with Malbec and Petit Verdot) is solid as granite, with a layered structure. Flavors of blackberry, chocolate and herbs dance together, while the finish is long, dark, minty and chocolaty. Best from 2016 through 2022.
Harsh and acidic and bone dry. Not much going on, beyond cherry and currant flavors, with lots of charred oak.
Black plum, baking spice and cedar aromas lead the way. On the firm medium-bodied palate, notes of mocha and toasted oak underscore blackberry jam while assertive tannins provide support. Drink through 2020.
Classic M-S-R Riesling aromas of slate, green apple and lime lead to flavors that are appropriately stony and minerally, buffered by just enough fruit and sweetness. Light in body, long and racy on the finish. Drink now–2020.
For a wine with all of this ripeness and concentration, this is remarkably light on its feet. It's a medium-bodied Shiraz with a creamy texture and plenty of mocha, leather and berries, with a long, silky, coffee-tinged finish. Drink now–2015.
Light and fresh on the nose, this twist-top bottling shows hibiscus, strawberry, chipped slate, a touch of clove and crushed star anise on the nose. The palate shows more slate as well as ripe raspberry, cinnamon and sagebrush.
From six vineyards across the Central Coast, Josh Jensen's annual cuvée shows black cherry, cola and nutmeg on the straight-ahead nose. Solid herbal backbone shows on the sip, with juniper, bay leaf and pine needles giving tang to the sour cranberry fruit. A menthol character carries in to the finish.
Soalheiro is in the heartland of Alvarinho in the northern Vinho Verde, close to Spain. This Reserva is a fine expression of the grape that has been enhanced and given added richness by light oak aging. It's a wine that should age to soften the tight crispness. Drink from the end of 2016.
This smoky wood-aged wine shows tannins as well as black fruits. It has a fine structure that balances with the fruitiness. Produced in the Entre-deux-Mers, the wine has a spicy, fresh aftertaste.
Subtle savory mineral flavors and an impressive mouth-filling texture give a unique personality to this medium-bodied wine. An unusual blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Marsanne, it has tangy acidity offset by hints of richness while lemon and crisp apple flavors light up the palate.
Smells grassy and sweaty, kind of like Sauvignon Blanc. The palate is chunky and awkward feeling, with pink grapefruit and passion fruit flavors. Fades fast and easy on the finish. Contains 20% Verdejo in addition to Tempranillo, which explains the citrusy aromas and flavors. Imported by USA Wine West.
Exuberant floral tones persist from nose to finish in this luminously sweet Riesling. It's feather light on the palate, yet pineapple and mango flavors are unctuous and concentrated. A spray of tangerine acidity extends the finish endlessly.
Made from Castelão grapes, this crisp wine has red fruits that burst out of the glass and give a lively aftertaste, with tight acidity. Drink now.
94–96 This is a beautiful Yquem, not huge or powerful, but with crispness, honey and freshness, very expressive of the year. The higher than usual proportion of Sauvignon in the blend gives it a real lift.
An intersting and fruit-forward Cape blend composed of 57% Pinotage, 23% Shiraz, 14% Cab Sauv and 6% Merlot. Kirsch and red plum along with subtle accents of rubber and tar fill the profile. Soft and quite easygoing with low tannins and a short finish.
This savory Zin screams its varietal identity with a blast of pepper, nutmeg and clove that accompanies ripe blackberries, wild cherries, mulberries and smoky oak. The wine feels very soft and lightly elegant in the mouth, but fully dry. Perfect for restaurant wine lists.
This is a perfectly good rosé that's 90% Tempranillo and 10% Viura, hence the Clarete name. Fresh aromas of nectarine and citrus show a touch of yeasty vanilla, while the palate feels pure and zesty. Orange and pink grapefruit are the key flavors, and the finish is snappy.
The high alcohol spoils this wine. It gives too much richness, pepper and immense superripe fruits. The wine is of course very full, very rich and with dense tannins. It lacks balance.
Straddles the line between dry and sweet, with sugary flavors of oranges and vanilla. A good, clean wine, with brisk acidity, but somewhat simple.
Apple, pear, coconut and chalk mark the bouquet of this smooth yet crisp and brisk wine from the Napa microproducer. Lime, pineapple and apricot with oak and cinnamon shadings are in play on the rich, viscous palate and flow beautifully through to the finish. Though full, the wine never gets weighty. It closes light on its feet, long and tangy, with lemon, cream and oak accents.
This medium-sweet blend of Feteasca Regala and Riesling has aromas of honeysuckle and lemon blossom. There are flavors of peach and pineapple in the mouth, with a floral touch on the finish.
The red juiced Alicante Bouschet has produced a powerful and generous wine that's rich and full of southern sun as well as dark black fruits. It is concentrated and impressive with its ripe flavors. Foot-trodden in open fermenters, it is full and generous needing to age until 2017.
Made from 100% Syrah, this wine is dark red and intense, offering flavors of baked strawberry-rhubarb and savory cranberry and pomegranate. Perfumy in jasmine, it finishes ripe and succulent.
Everything about this Pinot is upfront, but it's beautiful. Softly appealing, with a silky mouthfeel, it offers flattering raspberry and cherry jam flavors, with smoky, sweet, buttery notes. The softness suggests that the wine is not ageable.
Cabernet Sauvignon makes up 60% of this wine, with the rest Merlot (29%) and Cabernet Franc. It presents aromas of macerated cherries, licorice and whiffs of game. The flavors are lush and ripe, with firm but well-integrated tannins providing support.
Opens with common berry fruit aromas as well as a medicinal, minty note. The palate has short length and definition along with bouncy medium-depth berry flavors. Warm, simple touches of licorice and mint define the finish. A blend of 60% Monastrell with 20% each Syrah and Tempranillo.
Richly textured and sumptuous, this Pinot has cherry, red licorice, cola, pepper and sandalwood flavors that go on into a long, spicy finish. The tannins are silky and integrated. The wine displays the fruit forwardness of the vintage, as well as the careful viticulture of the vineyard. Lovely to drink now with steak, and it will reward cellaring until 2020 to 2022.
This very fragrant wine has ripe quince and pear flavors, as well as a great mineral texture. Fresh and finely balanced, and with tight acidity, it's a wine for long-term aging. Drink from 2016. Screwcap.
This is a fragrant, lemon flavored wine, with a fine balance between acidity and rich apple and pear flavors. It's young, although certainly drinkable now, while it will be better from 2016.
This is a generous and ripe version of the variety, reflective of warmer Napa Valley sites, and a wine that's completely delicious in its abundance of apple and caramel.
Sweet and ripe tones of raspberry and black cherry help soften this naturally tannic and sharp wine from northern Italy. There are loads of perfumed and floral notes as well and firm tannins seal the close.
Black-currant, dark-plum and herb aromas are in the lead. The flavors are on the lighter side, with the oak seeming quite dialed back.
The Ratbag makes for a pleasant, if somewhat generic dry red. Dried fruit and prune notes are complemented by chocolate overtones and the mouthfeel is soft and user-friendly.
This has a balance and elegance that recommends it above many New York wines of the same variety. An expressive nose of red berry, coffee, some spice leads into balanced, appetizing flavors of cherry and pepper with a smoky, rich edge. Dry and food-friendly, this has class.
Reedy on the nose, with notes of pine and juniper to go with tobacco and earthy baked-berry aromas. It feels lively but clacky, with flavors of vanilla, coconut and secondary notes of cassis and berry. The finish is lactic and creamy, with a vanilla note.
The fogs that roll off the nearby ocean (only one ridge away) give the Riesling the perfect conditions for botrytis. Harvested in mid-October, the wine has a fine balance of rich honeyed fruit and intense acidity. Yellow fruits and a toffee edge add extra flavors. Drink this wine from 2019.
This is a rare venture by Olivier Leflaive outside his home territory around Puligny, Chassagne and Meursault. The wine is classic Corton-Charlemagne, big and bold, a broad-shouldered wine that brings together toastiness, ripe pineapple and mango and balancing, lively acidity. It is already giving great pleasure, but should last well over the next decade.
Incredible fruit intensity. Cranberry, pomegranate and cherry meet rock, gravel and pepper. Lovely focus and purity; it's concentrated and tight, with a minerality that is compelling and distinctive. The best yet from Cailloux. Syrah is co-fermented with 4 or 5% Viognier.  It's a world-class effort, still quite young and tight, but built for beautiful aging.
This head-turning wine was made from vines planted in the 1970s and 1990s—a selection that shocks with its complex beauty. Pine forest and Christmas spice notes accent cranberry, rhubarb and tart citrus flavors, all seemingly infused with seductive smoke. At its juicy core is an earthy, mushroomy component.
Tough tannins set the scene for this firm and extracted wine, giving it a smokiness and a touch of bitter fruit. However, the wine has the weight to support the tannins, and it hints at future juicy fruit. Keep this for at least five years.
Klipsun fruit is known for its firm tannins, iron and mineral elements, dark fruit and sturdy ageworthiness. Here a touch of the barnyard in the bouquet brings it ever closer to Bordeaux. It's a complex wine, which, despite its youth, shows a wonderful range of flavors, from black cherry to coffee to steel and smoke. The iron and acids and tannin are there to age, but it drinks beautifully right now, so why wait? Just 138 cases made.
A pale pink color, this pretty rosé offers ripe notes of strawberry, watermelon and banana on the nose and mouth. Easy-drinking and approachable, the fruit-forward palate is balanced by bright acidity, finishing clean and mouthwatering. Drink now.
Stylish and tight, with compact flavors of cassis, black cherry and berry in a wrap of baby fat. This muscular Cab has the toasty joie de vivre of a new Bordeaux, without all the herbal stuff. New (as of 2003) winemaker Kevin Mott seems to have solved the issues that were creating severely reduced, hard-as-nails wines in recent vintages.
A part of this estate's vineyards are in the Sainte-Victoire subappellation close to the landmark mountain of that name. This is a dense wine with serious tannins at this stage. It also has generous potential, along with the tight black-currant and blackberry fruits. Drink this wine from 2020.
Hard-edged aromas of cheesy oak, leather, wiry berry fruits and graphite are a bit hot when totaled up. Tight, fresh and juicy on the palate, this tastes of currant, plum and vanilla. A finish with heavy but integrated oak as well as residual heat and burn says drink through 2022.
This earthy Chardonnay from a limestone plot has more to do with texture and tight acidity than fruit. It presents a sharp, too-crisp edge.
A relatively small-production offering from Michael David at 3,600 cases, this white wine blend is quaffable, full-bodied and slightly sweet.
A full-out vegetal nose is anchored by a strong scent of canned peas. This shows wiry acidity while maintaining a full body. Salty citrus and green-bean flavors echo the nose. The wine is short on the finish and undeniably green.
A plump, medium-bodied Riesling, this shows the ripeness of the vintage in its ample alcohol (11.5%) and remaining residual sweetness, but doesn't seem heavy or overdone. Honeyed stone fruit and melon are buoyed by some slate-driven minerality while the finish remains succulent and fresh.
This legendary bottling shows all the hallmarks of a young, vital Cabernet that needs plenty of time. It's classically balanced and rich in blackberries, currants and chocolate, with perhaps a bit more tannic structure than in the past, due to the cool vintage. Drink from 2018 and well beyond.
Charred oak, maple, tobacco and berry aromas are full and clean. The palate is solid but not so polished and smooth that there's no edge to things. Flavors of mocha and leather support core black-fruit notes, and then vanilla rushes in on the finish and takes over. Drink now through 2014.
A sensational value, this blends fruit from a half-dozen vineyards that carry the winery's vineyard designates. Soft and appealing flavors mix citrus, plum and berry in a juicy, wide open, flat out delicious bottle. The fruit is the star, although a year in 9% new French oak adds a nice touch of toast.
Aromas of dark spice, sage, dark berry and espresso waft from the glass. The straightforward palate delivers black currant, raspberry and clove alongside velvety tannins.
A challenging name for a pretty good wine, given the frost and smoke issues so many North Coast producers faced in 2008, not to mention consumers' tendency to stay away from wines that might give them headaches. This 50% Petite Sirah-based blend (there's Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon, too) is a sledgehammer of a wine, all savory leather and dark blue fruit, with a velvety structure that'll linger a long time.
This is a solid, angular wine, both its structure and its fruit coming together well. It has an underlying new-wood character that is powerful and rich. The tannins taste sweet and are already softening.
No oak to interfere with the ripe, opulent flavors of pineapples, lemons, limes and tangerines, which are brightened and heightened by crisp acidity. The price is right on this balanced, savory Chardonnay.
A bit heavy handed, with lots of tannins and acidity, and the jammy cherry-berry fruit is in your face. It's made in a big, bold style that will appeal to fruit-forward fans.
There are three benches at the estate vineyard —west, north and south-facing. This 100% Syrah is a blend of two of them. You get the more earthy Northern Rhône attributes; exotic scents of herb and cured meat—not bacon fat from the barrel but legitimate flavors from the terroir. In 2006 it's tight, edgy and still youthful; this is an ageworthy Syrah that will expand and develop over the next 6–8 years. For the moment, it needs decanting to show its best. After breathing, as the wine opens, new layers of flavor emerge: soy, vanilla, raisin and buttered nuts.
The wine certainly tastes rich, perhaps on the brazen side of opulence. It does have structure, though, giving shape to the pepper, spice and black plum juice flavors. Despite the tannins, this is not for aging.

There's something Chablisian about this Chardonnay. It's partly the acidity, which is high, and partly the gunmetal minerality, courtesy of another cool vintage in the southern Napa/Carneros region where the grapes were grown.

Amicus has been doing a good job over the years producing richly intense mountain-style Cabs. This one, from a warm vintage, is very ripe, showing lusty red and black currant flavors. The tannins are thick, but sweet and fine, making the wine instantly drinkable, although decanting won't hurt. Best now–2010.
Just off dry, this is a rounded soft wine that takes its name after the sun god Apollo from the sunny exposure of the vineyard. It has a rounded, generous feel as a foil to its more steely, crisp character. A wine that certainly needs aging for 3–4 years.
Tired and oxidized on the nose, this offers just-adequate freshness on the palate, but the wine is losing steam. Flavors of oxidized white fruits and bitter citrus finish dully.
Sweet-tart pineapple and apple tones contrast leafy swathes of fresh herbs in this savory Tocai Friulano. Dry and full bodied, it's luscious and silky on the palate but finishes briskly.
What a great price for a Pinot Noir with this charm and integrity. It's a wonderful wine, dry and rich in raspberry, cherry and spice flavors. Feels svelte and silky in the mouth, just like you want Pinot to be. Might even gain a few notes with a year or two in the bottle.
This is a somewhat bitter and thin wine on entry. Lemon flavors are closer to skin and pith than ripe flesh, and there is little to suggest varietal specificity here.
Clean, fresh and simple, this does not claim to be “unoaked” but it carries that style in its flavors, a snappy mix of green apple, pineapple and grapefruit. Good everyday drinking.
Aromas include jammy strawberry and grassy green beans. The wine is lean in the mouth, with tart citrus and green-leaning red-fruit flavors. It finishes without complexity.
Kracher's fame rests on the series of cuvées he makes, which increases in intensity the higher the number. In 2003, the series was broken because of the dry year and the lack of botrytis, and only one wine was made. It certainly has exceptional power from the heat of the year, with raisins as much as botrytis on the palate, and relatively low acidity.
Excellent. Has deep, pretty aromas of clay, eraser and ripe red plum. Its plum-fruit core has a crisp minty edge, and the package is all couched in a rich, claylike texture. The wine is well structured and sturdy, its red fruit tightening and retreating through the finish. Needs time; drink 2006+.
The creamy, rich notes of freshly baked pear tart reach the senses first. Next the palate offers a soft, gentle and almost breezy freshness with citrus peel, floral overtones, creamy hints of shortbread and something primal like rock and stone. All of this is held together in a tableau of freshness, poise and elegance. The dry and lasting finish hints at riches to come, and this lovely wine will develop further. Drink now until 2030.
While there are not many acres of Gamay in Michigan, it seems to be an viable addition to the rows of Pinot throughout the the state's two northern AVAs. From a warmer vintage, this wine shows plenty of red cherry and strawberry alongside lightly toasted vanilla. While juicy and snappy, a light dusting of tannins offers just enough support.
A pure Syrah from estate fruit, this dark, peppery, earthy wine is saturated with color and ripe fruit flavor. From the Yakima Valley estate, it buttresses the currant and cherry fruit with polished tannins that add many layers of depth and nuances of earth and smoke. The extra bottle time (this is the current release) has also helped to smooth out the rough edges. As the estate vineyard ages and the vines mature, these wines are gaining in both strength and detail.
This is Syrah with great purity of fruit, especially blueberry. The fruit is thick and tongue-coating, though well positioned with supporting acidity. It's a rich, supple wine with tannins and acids that are refined and in perfect proportion.
Lightly fined and unfiltered, it's slightly cloudy in appearance with notes of mineral, citrus, herbs and spice. Aged partly in neutral oak, with the rest in stainless steel, the flavors are light, with a creamy midpalate and tart, electric acids, that verge on sour. Pair this with shellfish to see it at its best.
Aged for 10 months in stainless steel in order to maintain simple, clean lines, this Nero di Troia opens with a spicy tone of black pepper, backed by ripe blackberry and prune notes. There's a touch of bright acidity on the finish.
This delicate Barbaresco moves over the palate lightly and softly, imparting notes of wild berry, cedar, white truffle and licorice. The intensity builds in the mouth, where the wine gains momentum thanks to its tight, compact structure and its lingering tones of smoke and ash.
This Pinot is texturally very interesting, its robust, wooly tannins well obscuring the cherry and cola flavors underneath. That will change in the short term, I expect; a more integrated wine would lead to an even more favorable review. 283 cases produced. Imported by Australian Wine Connection.
Floral aromas of honeysuckle and jasmine take center stage on this polished off-dry sparkler. On the silky palate, fresh acidity enlivens rich flavors of creamy white peach, candied citrus drop and ripe yellow apple while a refined bead lends elegance.
Densely tannic and rich, this is full of ripe chocolate and blackberry fruit. It is dark, brooding and dense—a great success for the second wine of Château du Glana.
The aromas are light, with notes of garden herb, pencil lead, barrel spice and dark fruit that are not yet ready to fully reveal their potential. The palate brings considerably more generosity, with lithe black-fruit flavors backed by fine-grained tannins. It's a very pretty expression of the variety.
Well along the aging curve, this feels a bit pushed, with divergent and strong flavors of cherry, plum, licorice, smoke and sweet toast. There's a lot going on, though little sense of the elegance that often typifies Pinot Noir, and the tannins have a rough, rustic quality.
Roasted, rubbery aromas come with an herbal offset and mild stalky notes. This is full and rubbery feeling, with baked berry, herb and peppery flavors residing before a dry, tannic, stocky finish that's a fair conclusion to this blend of Garnacha, Carignan and Cabernet Sauvignon.
The berry flavors in this wine are fighting to emerge, but they are overwhelmed by dusty tannins and a lack of texture.
Smoke and savory nut aromas dissipate to reveal a dramatic backdrop of rose petal and peach on the nose of this dry, full-bodied Riesling. The palate is generously textured, with a rich, creamy mouthfeel, but finishes elegantly, with a murmur of lime-pith astringency.
Light brown and slightly translucent in color. Aromas lean toward raisin and prune, but there's orange zest and molasses on the bouquet as well. Bores straight ahead on the palate, with sweet flavors of burnt brown sugar, caramel and prune. Satisfying and balanced even if it's not overly complex.
Unlike this firm's minerally, muscular Rieslings, this Pinot Gris shows plenty of forward fruit, ranging from honey to tangerines to melon. Viscous and slightly off-dry, with a long, peppery finish. Drink now.
This is one of the palest Pinots of the vintage, so translucent, you can hardly believe its power. A blend of various Dutton Ranch vineyards the result is serious and fabulous, a complex wine with cherry, cola and spice flavors and a luxuriously silky texture. This is textbook, world class RRV Pinot from a very great vintage.
This iconic wine is rich and perfumed. It's powerful and concentrated, with layers of wood contrasted by explosive, ripe fruits. Ripe red-fruit flavors are brightened by ample acidity, resulting in a sumptuous wine that also has enough tannins to age. Drink from 2018.
A blend of 47% Cabernet Sauvignon, 35% Shiraz, 14% Merlot, 3% Cabernet Franc and 1% Malbec, this clean, approachable red offers notes of black plum, cherry, cocoa and spice on the nose and mouth. A peppery heat on the tongue lingers through the medium finish, as do the dusty tannins.
So ripe and rich in fruit, you won't even notice the absence of oak. The grapes come mostly from Lodi, with a touch of Monterey. Brightened with crisp acidity, the flavors are of spicy, zesty tangerines and vanilla.
Anything remotely resembling true Chardonnay at this price is rare, but here's one that succeeds, if at the most elemental level. It's got proper apple and peach fruit and the requisite amount of vanilla-tinged oak, although probably not from new French barrels. It's a tiny bit sweet, but hey, that's the way people like it. And it's very clean. All of which makes it a great value in   Chardonnay.
This wine hails from an estate that dates back to 1978, but was more recently purchased by San Luis Obispo developer Rob Rossi and Raytheon CEO Bill Swanson. They assembled a “dream team” of grower Kevin Wilkinson (of Talley Vineyards and Coastal Vineyard Services) and winemakers Mike Sinor and Nathan Carlson. The wine boasts a lifting nose of cream, hazelnut and baked apples, then dances across the palate with lemon-zest and flint flavors.
This opens with dusty dried-apple aromas. High acidity preserves its composure even though the fruit is marginal and vacillates between flavors of apple and lemony citrus.
This friendly red blend, made with Cabernet, Steuben and Ives, starts with aromas of allspice, cherry and pepper followed by flavors of fresh, tart red berry and spice. It's a fun and easy-drinking red that will pair well with myriad dishes, from pasta to grilled steaks.
This is an attractive red-fruit flavored wine with fine acidity as well as juicy berries and cherry. Its soft tannins are just right to sustain the delicious fruitiness. Dink this wine from 2017.
For the last several years Surh Luchtel has been tinkering to get this wine right. The '05 is their best yet, a dry, silky, light-bodied wine, with complex layers of cherry skin, rhubarb pie, root beer, rose petal and red licorice flavors, enhanced with toasted new oak. The winemaker seems to be striving to tame the aggressive character this vineyard can bring to Pinot, in favor of delicacy and elegance. He has largely succeeded. A wine to watch.
Aromas of pressed white flower and a hint of stone fruit lead the nose. The simple palate offers subtle green apple and unripe yellow peach alongside bright acidity.
For an ice wine, this is relatively rich. But it certainly doesn't take away from the pure acidity that lifts the sweet fruit, giving the ripe peach and dried apricot flavors a great frame. It is ready to drink now, but another year and it will be even better focused.
Barolo Riva is a fantastic wine with enormous personality and charm. At the outset, the wine appears modern and bold with determined aromas of black fruit and spice. But wait a second and the wine will surprise you with its sassy complexity and finesse. Give it 10 more years of cellar aging. A Marc de Grazia selection; various American importers.
While aromatically subdued, this is a refreshing, easy-drinking white blend, with pleasant lemon and apple flavors. A hint of orange peel and a brisk, lime-accented acidity highlight the midpalate. Drink now.
A full-bodied white, it opens with aromas of lightly toasted oak, golden apple and ripe pear. The smooth palate offers yellow peach, apple and citrus with a hint of butterscotch alongside firm acidity.
Starts out with dark berry aromas and then slips upon airing as roasted, leafy, leathery notes take over. Sports a clacky feel and zingy acidity along with a quick wash of red fruit flavors, herbs and heat. Finishes herbal and slightly leafy, with vanilla sweetness.
This is an elegantly subdued white, at an attractive price, from a part of the valley that does well growing this variety. A sweetness of pear and vanilla interweave across crisp acidity, without intrusion or confusion from oak.
The label includes the words “Original Vines” written along the side, a nod to the history of this limited reserve, gleaned from vines planted by founder David Lett in 1965. It's steely and sharp edged, with sculpted fruit and limited use of new oak. Cellarworthy and distinctive, this wine rewards your attention and patience with unexpected layers of detail.
Here's a big, bold interpretation of Barbera that sees 18 months of careful aging in oak to achieve aromas of black spice, cassis syrup, cola, mesquite and cedar. You can taste the youthfulness and the freshness of the fruit in the palate, and the wine ends with persistency and a silky texture.
Petit Verdot is known for its color, and this wine is dark purple, almost black. The tannins are also pretty prominent, although they are balanced by a freshness from black currant fruits and a fine, mineral structure. There is a touch of pepper and spice at the end. Drink from 2018.
Made entirely with the native grape Timorasso, this structured elegant white opens with aromas of acacia flower and hay. The bright palate delivers apricot, lemon zest, hazelnut and a touch of ginger while a mineral vein energizes the finish. Enjoy through 2025.
Owned by France's national agricultural research institute, this estate has been curiously underperforming until the last two vintages. This 2007, almost entirely Sauvignon Blanc, continues the improvement, a deliciously fresh, herbaceous wine, with a currant freshness on top of grapefruit and lime.
This exuberant wine oozes with delicious black cherry and blackberry flavors, delivered on a lively texture of fine-grained tannin and fresh acidity. On subsequent sips, a light toasty, meaty flavor drifts in, adding even more complexity and interest.
Delicious and classy, this is based on Merlot, with the other four classic Bordeaux varieties in proper proportion. It flatters immediately with its wealth of blackberries, black cherries, cola and mocha that finish so dry and spicy, yet it has that extra complexity that makes it intellectually interesting. Drink now and over the next six years.
An oily white-fruit aroma is overrun by a heavy oak scent, leaving notes of resin and toast on the bouquet. The wine feels fleshy, and the palate keeps that theme going with baked flavors of apple and peach. This is about as oaky as a wine can be and still be very good.
With a dark enough color to be a red wine and ample cherry and plum flavors, this Grenache bottling is not simply an apéritif. It's full-bodied, rather rich in texture and will pair nicely with meats and cheeses.
Apricot juice, cantaloupe and pineapple are accented by crisp notes of kiwi and lime. Coats the mouth very well, with a silky, long-lasting finish. Imported by Winebow.
Saucy and jammy initially, and then a raisiny quality takes over. Plump and thick in the mouth, but ultra jammy in terms of mouthfeel. Syrupy and raisiny flavors run the game, and in the end it weighs in as an overripe wine from one of the hottest vintages on record.
Clean and smooth to open, with a hint of salinity, powdered sugar and peach. The palate is sheer and zesty, with lemon, green apple and tangy acidity. Crisp yet angular on the finish, but good in a narrow, lean, drilling sort of way.
Quite a bit of Tempranillo is being planted in southern Oregon, and it shows considerable promise. The flavors here suggest cherry cobbler, with ripe fruit at the center. There are streaks of citrus and a touch of toast in the mix, with drying tannins.
Concentrated and earthy up front, with aromas of blackberry, boysenberry, graham cracker, leather and a whack of robust oak just for good measure. Feels big and chewy, with broad, oaky flavors of black fruit, herb, tea and exotic spice. Finishes heavy but gentle in feel. Drink now through 2014.
The aromas offer notes of cocoa, herb, cedar, cherry and barrel spice. The palate is somewhat barrel-forward but otherwise shows a pleasing sense of balance along with a lingering finish.
Slightly mulchy and damp, with herbal red fruit reflecting plum and cherry. Mildly tannic with a simple finish. Never really finds a groove. Imported by Quality Wine Direct.
There's a fresh, juicy sense of dark cherry and cranberry in this medium-bodied wine. A lurking forested, mushroomy earthiness hovers around it as well, the finish awash in rich, dark toasty oak accented by notes of chocolate.
With its tropical melony aromas and crisp palate, this comes across as rock-solid Torrontés. It's tight and tastes of lime and pineapple. There's an exactness to this wine, sort of like savoring a perfect lime. Not complicated but very satisfying; drink immediately for maximum freshness.
With that extra concentration that comes from low-yielding old vines, this has great depth of flavor. It has an apple flavor and crisp, citrusy acidity as well as a more toasty character. Complex and certainly ageworthy, this should keep for at least five years.
A lovely expression of Rheingau's exquisite minerality, this dry Riesling pulsates tones of steel and stone. Green apple and fresh herb flavors are highlighted by racy streaks of lime and lemon. It's slight in frame, but finishes with precision and power.
This wine bears the blue label, and includes 20% Sauvignon Blanc in the blend. The grapes were co-fermented and aged in oak. The wine is grassy, woody and herbal, with tart acidity. Unusual, but perhaps it would have been better if left entirely in stainless.
This is a concentrated, lovely wine that offers a depth of red berry, forest floor and herbes de Provence. All of the wine's elements come together seamlessly on the palate. Approachable now, but should also age well.
A strong blast of oak and wood shavings are up front and on top of the nose on this chunky Cabernet. Baked, herbal flavors of cassis and raspberry are toasty, slightly green and minty. Flavors of herbs and carob rest heavily on a plump, warm finish.
The Awatere Valley is a cooler subsection of Marlborough, where the wines can sometimes be a bit more leafy or herbal. This wine holds true to that pattern, but balances the celery leaf and tomato stalk character with melon and fig notes. It's verging on full-bodied, even a touch oily in texture, with a long, vibrant finish.
This is a full-bodied, dense wine. A hint of austerity in the mineral texture gives the wine a steely core. Around this center, ripe fruit fills out the wine and gives apricots and generous fruitiness as well as a crisp, perfumed aftertaste. Drink from 2017.
Aromas of ripe plum, clove, sage, a whiff of violet and a balsamic note lead the nose. The round, hearty palate is more monolithic than the nose suggests, doling out mature black cherry, licorice and the searing heat of evident alcohol. Firm velvety tannins provide support.
This aromatic wine has floral, grapefruity aromas, generous citrus flavors, light body, a dry profile and a slightly soft, smooth texture.
Black cherry, dark-fleshed plums and black pepper hints are mellowed by the rich overtones of new oak, while a seam of acidity keeps everything trim and fresh. This medium-bodied wine is approachable with a tangy black olive edge and medium length.
Made jointly by Filipa Pato and her husband William, a blend of Encruzado from Dão and Bical from Bairrada, and cask fermented. It is a beautiful wine, dense, concentrated, rich and creamy, a mouthfilling wine with white figs, and a green plum skin texture.
Well made, well rounded and well balanced, this medium-bodied wine has tasty fruit aromas and flavors. Spicy accents accompany a firm, layered texture and lasting finish.
It's difficult to find the aromas of stone fruit and herbs in the glass. The flavors show a lot of lightness and elegance but also a sense of balance.
A decent value in dry Riesling, this offering from the home estate of Valckenberg features scents of lime, clover blossom and petrichor (wet stones), then delivers bright citrusy-apple flavors. It's medium in body and broad in the mouth yet crisp at the same time, finishing with zesty acids. Drink now.
Soft and creamy, this wine has an attractive burst of freshness with apple and citrus flavors. Lightly textured and fruity, it is ready to drink.
A charged Burgundy, packed with dense tannins and powerful ripe black berry fruits. There's a delicious tension here between the fruits and the tannin, pushing the acidity, the red plums and strawberries forward, but keeping them in check. At this stage, it needs decanting; otherwise keep for 2–3 years.
As always, the Otis vineyard carries defining scents of pepper, sage, earth and stem; the fruit is restrained and also quite herbal. And yet the wine has old vine character, and ages beautifully, more like a Bordeaux than anything from this country. It's a fine bottle to tuck away into the cellar. Right now, the grapey, slightly plummy fruit and dried herbs are not entirely integrated.
An excellent value, the 2008 Gold Label Shiraz is a full-bodied, powerfully built wine, filled out by cassis, chocolate and tobacco flavors. It's long and velvety on the finish, not just an upfront powerhouse. Drink now–2020.
Offers developed aromas of brioche and dried apricots, with hints of mineral. The intense palate is viscous but the finish is dry. Drink with complex fish dishes.
With its crisp and strongly mineral character, this is true terroir wine. It is stony, steely, very textured, with the apple skin and strong pink grapefruit citrus flavors pushing through to give a fresh character at the end. The structure shows the wine needs to age, so drink from late 2015.
There are very ripe aromas of kirsch, cassis, licorice and root beer on the nose of this bottling, which begin to evolve into prunes, dried figs and raisins with time. The cola spice flavor is strong as are the prune and milk chocolate, all of which ride a strong tannic frame.
Beautifully perfumed with ripe pommelo, orange blossoms and a spray of fresh lemon zest. A rich, luscious mouthfeel on the palate is balanced with bright grapefruit acidity and a refreshing minerality. Finishes dry with a zesty lemon rind astringency.
An exciting Rhône white, oaky and rich in flamboyant tropical fruit, wildflower and spicy flavors. This big, flashy, opulent wine is a blend of Roussanne and Grenache Blanc.
Stony aromas of minerally citrus and nectarine are clean and upright. This Garnacha rosé is simple but good in feel, with generic but clean flavors of stone fruits. Bitter, pithy flavors rise up to dominate the finish.
Made by Nick Goldschmidt, this vineyard-designate is 100% varietal and made in relatively small amounts. Sanguine, it's gamy and brimming in black cherry, blueberry, nutmeg and black pepper. It's both robust and soft.
This opulent wine opens with a blast of buttered toast and tropical fruit aromas. The flavors are complex, with swirls of pineapple, pear, yeast, toast and cinnamon. Drink now–2015.
Soft and very ripe, this Syrah-Petite Sirah blend has currant and chocolate flavors that veer into raisins and prunes, with a strong peppery note. Yet it's very dry, with luxurious tannins, with a certain elegance. Drink now.
Heavy and stewy, with sweet molasses aromas but little to no freshness. Flavors of raisins and plums are dark and meaty, but lifeless. Imported by Classical Wines.
Creamy, almost powdery pear flavors dominate, but the palate is illuminated by bright, sprightly lemon acidity. There is an innate balance that can be summed up as creamy lemon on a dry, yeasty background. This is moreish, appetizing and has a lasting, fruity finish.
Modest cherry and strawberry notes appear on the nose and the palate, with some slightly herbal flavors as well. It's light in body, with soft acids and a relatively quick finish.
Fruit and tannins play well together in this wine. The blackberry flavors are crisp and juicy while having some richness ready to develop as the wine matures. Behind that, firm, mineral tannins give a strong sense of structure. Drink from 2017.
A rich wine with crisp apple and grapefruit flavors as well as a touch of sweetness, Lanson's non-vintage Brut always has fine acidity with just a hint of toast indicating some bottle age. It's bottled ready to drink.
This bright wine has red fruit and just the hint of structure. It is still young, still bursting with energy. The tannins will develop quickly to give a crisp, fruity wine. Drink from mid-2017.
Just a touch less lively than the 2002 and 2005 versions, Hugel's 2001 Gewürztraminer SGN is still excellent, boasting plenty of weight and richness allied to distinctive varietal aromas of rose petals and cracked white pepper alongside the dried apricot notes of botrytis.
Electric-pink in color, that offers aromas of cranberries and watermelon that lead to dry fruit flavors with a tart finish. It doesn't entirely stand up on its own but should fit in nicely at the dinner table.
Blended from Syrah, Mourvèdre and the two Cabernets, Sauvignon and Franc, this wine feels bitter and acidic in the mouth. It's very tannic and overripe, with flavors of prunes.
Dark in color and forcefully oaked on the nose, this resiny Malbec will appeal to fans of richly styled reds. Plum, berry, tomato leaf and herbal flavors finish woody but fair, with lasting acidity.
Rubber, cured meat and herbal berry aromas feed into a tomatoey palate with raw acidity and rough tannins. This features gritty flavors of berry and raisin, while the finish is a bit flat in feel and tastes of prune and stalky, roasted berries. Unlike many Ribera wines, this is earthy and not overly ripe. Drink through 2017.
With beautiful purity of fruit from the biodynamic Hardegg vineyards, this is a perfumed, apples and currant flavored wine. Light, airy, it dances on the palate, a lovely cool-climate Riesling.
This modestly priced Verdejo does exactly what it should: it smells nice and clean, with white-fruit aromas. It's pure and easygoing on the palate, with stony minerality, and it tastes like green apple, peach and melon, with dry pithiness to the finish. Drink now.
Much improved over the unripe 2005, Fritz's 2006 is quite a delicious and sophisticated Sauvignon Blanc. Partially barrel fermented and with some Musque clone for complexity, it's richly textured and creamy, with a mélange of pineapple, Meyer lemon, Asian pear, lychee, fig and dusty spice flavors.
This delightful, off-dry white is a blend of Pinot Gris, Gewürztraminer, Müller Thurgau, Sauvignon Blanc and Riesling,  perfectly matched to deliver crisp, fruity aromatics and flavors of apples, oranges and pears. It's a terrific anytime quaffer.
Dry, woody, herbal aromas wrap around creamy red fruit scents. The palate is juicy and kind of narrow, with generic cherry and plum flavors blending with creamy oak notes. Tastes and feels a touch lactic.
Restrained aromas suggesting acacia flower, nut and honey lead the nose. The subdued palate offers yellow apple skin, hazelnut and mineral alongside fresh acidity.
Ripe with a core of dry tannins, this is a typical foursquare Nuits-Saint-Georges. Structure gives shape to the black fruits and acidity that are developing well. Already in balance, it will be drinkable from 2016.
Minerally, oceanic aromas of sea shell, apple and nectarine are focused and fresh. In the mouth, this is easygoing and a bit plump, with good acidity pushing peach, citrus and apple flavors. A pithy finish with hints of almond skin is mildly bitter and tight.
The vineyard is noted for the quality of its Syrahs, and this one is right up there, although as currently constituted, it's a bit too young. Shows thick tannins and very ripe flavors of blackberry jam, cassis, cherry liqueur, melted dark chocolate, violets and a wonderful appliqué of cedar, finished with crunchy black pepper. Better by the winter of 2009, with slow-braised short ribs.
This is a serious, rich, concentrated wine. It has weight, density and a powerful structure that offers black cherry and plum fruits. Dominated at this stage by a dry, tannic core, it needs to age. Drink from 2017.
There's a small amount of residual sugar left in this wine (about 4g/L); not enough to taste, just enough to add weight to the palate. Soft peach and pear fruit is accented by musky, spicy flavors that turn lean and citrusy on the finish.
Whiffs of saffron and spice lend earthen complexity to cutting lime and green plum in this zesty Riesling. Off dry on the palate, it's delicately sheer and spry. Its invigorating style is pleasurable already, but should only meld and improve from now through 2022.
Toasty and crisp, it showcases pretty cherry fruit as the main attraction. There's trace bitterness in the oak tannins, but ample breathing time will help to smooth it out.
The aromas are generous, with notes of cigar box, dried herb, brambly berry and dried hay. The meaty flavors are round and full, providing appeal, finishing a bit warm.
The wine shows the firmly tannic structure of the vintage. It is dense, packed with dark fruits and dry tannins that are slowly developing. That makes for a rich, black-fruited wine, concentrated and needing to age further. Drink from 2018.
Inviting aromas of cracked pepper, dried fennel, spiced meat and berry give this elegant Merlot from Paarl instant character. On the palate, smooth, integrated flavors of pepper and spiced meat are layered, while the soft tannins give the wine a delicate edge. Still a spin of heat in the wine; consider holding for a few years.
Made in a jammy, soft but enormously rich style, this Syrah is almost like Port, except that it's dry. You'll want to sip it slowly, over time, to let it shape-shift in the glass. It offers waves of cherry pie filling, blackberry marmalade and cassis flavors, touched with sweetly smoked oak. Calls for very rich and elaborate beef and lamb dishes.
It's easy to get ripe fruit in California and then plaster it in oak, but what's so difficult to achieve is the crisp, minerally structure this wine displays. It's rich in pineapple cream, Key lime pie, Meyer lemon sorbet, golden mango and vanilla oak flavors, but achieves balanced elegance with crisp acidity and a wonderful stony purity. Only 349 cases produced.
Long known for their powerful, elegant Chardonnays, Chalk Hill's 1998 offering is impressive for its complex array of aromas and flavors. The toasty, leesy, popcorn elements adorn full, richly nuanced sweet pear, pineapple and peach flavors. A lovely, smooth mouthfeel with a slight granular quality adds texture and interest. This refined wine exudes finesse and refinement.
This firmly structured wine has a good, gripping texture and lots of black cherry and black-plum flavors. Backed by bracing acidity and a modest layer of tannin, it's a versatile wine for lunch or dinner.
Plenty of intense new oak sets the nose in a direction toward mint, licorice and black pepper. And that's all good, because the palate backs it up  with prime blackberry and cassis flavors. This is a solid wine with slightly pronounced acids and tannins. Not for those averse to a little grab and kick.
Unusual for Oz, in that the primary variety in the blend is Cabernet Franc (74%), with lesser amounts of Merlot (15%) and Cabernet Sauvignon (11%). The result is a fragrant, slightly herbal wine with plenty of red cherry fruit balanced out by vanilla and chocolate notes. It's lighter in body than most Ozzie Cabs, with silky tannins on the finish. Drink now–2012. Imported by Margaret River Wines, LLC.
The Gunderloch wines are among the best from Rheinhessen, even their non-site-specific wines like the Diva spätlese. Aromas of bergamot, pear and fresh greens give way to ripe pineapple, citrus and herb flavors. It's fresh and zippy, offering a lot of refreshment value in an off-dry style.
Herbal aromas give a grassy wine that is textured and tangy. This seems to miss out on real fruitiness, although the final acidity is attractive.
Toasted oak, espresso and a whiff of tire rubber open the nose on this wine. The palate displays crushed black cherry alongside coffee, sweet vanilla and plum. Bracing tannins need time to integrate.
Blackberry, ripe plum, kitchen spice and moist earth aromas lead the nose. The straightforward, easy-drinking, palate offers black cherry, white pepper and a hint of anise alongside lively acidity.
This is a rich, dry wine that has ripe flavors of yellow fruits and baked apples. It has a mineral texture, tangy acidity and a smooth yet fresh finish. Drink from 2016.
A crusty smelling wine with aromas of crude oil, roasted nuts and modest berry fruit. Feels acidic and scratchy, with balsamic flavors and a chalky finish. Prickly and teetering on sour, with a lasting herbal impression.
Winemaker James Ewart's powerful bottling shows blueberry, vanilla, dark spice and scarlet-red roses on the nose, followed by an intriguing complexity on the palate. Flavors of blackberry jam and black pepper run through the sip, as does a touch of roasted beef, framed by bursting acidity.
Peppery and meaty, with stewed plum flavors, this is much more muscular and tannic than Colombo's Côte-Rôtie, yet still lacks the spark seen in his top Cornas bottlings. A bit rustic and wild, but it doesn't seem to have the concentration of fruit to age long term. Drink–2012, with grilled beef.
Notions of very ripe, almost golden apricots shimmer in the glass. There is a touch of honey and a hedonistic peachy note that pervades this entire wine from first sniff to lasting finish. This is dry Riesling at its roundest and peachiest. I defy anyone not to drink a second glass. The finish is delicious and moreish.
A full-bodied Cab, with bold cassis flavors tinged with vanilla. There's no hint of green in this ripe, rich wine and no hard edges, either. Long on the finish—a top Cab for a reasonable price.
This wine is made from grapes grown on the producer's RockRise Mountain vineyard, 1,100-feet up. Graham cracker provides a decadent introduction to the nose and palate, as extracted, extended red fruit plays along. Full bodied and concentrated, with rounded corners, it ends in cola and vanilla.
There's tons of upfront fruit in this exuberant, easy drinking wine. Red and black cherries star, with notes of black raspberries and chocolate. Finishes with a sweet, sugary flourish.
This is an unfocused wine with fruit flavors that miss the mark. Only the juicy aftertaste is attractive.
This Sauvignon opens with beautiful aromas of exotic fruit, citrus, dried sage and a touch of cinnamon spice at the back. The mouthfeel is smooth and dense with a crisp, but creamy aftertaste.
A fine example of white Hermitage, Guigal's 2012 offers mellow, ripe stone-fruit aromas. It's medium to full in body, with flavors that suggest toasted marshmallow, stone fruit and anise hyssop.

Made of 85% Sangiovese, 10% Merlot and 5% Canaiolo, this opens with subtle floral and black fruit aromas. It's a simple red, showing cherry and clove flavors, framed by relaxed tannins. Enjoy soon.
Combine a cool year with cool-climate, single-vineyard origins and the result is this: olive, bell pepper and saucy tomato aromas, followed by a pointy, high-acid palate that's jagged in feel. Snappy red-plum and red-cherry flavors end with acid-driven crispness.
Forest floor, wild berry, new leather and balsam are some of the aromas you'll find in this bright, linear red. On the palate, firm, polished tannins support ripe red cherry, white pepper, andcrushed mint notes with a hint of black tea. It's still young and tightly wound but already boasts stunning elegance. Drink 2020–2032.
Somewhat rustic and sweet, but a decent Zin to drink at parties and barbecues. It's soft and tasty in blackberries, cherries, chocolate and spices.

This opens with dark, inky concentration and savory aromas of leather, spice, tobacco and black fruit. An interesting touch of bitterness appears on the finish.
This wine offers a direct and immediate delivery of aromas that hits the nose in an intense and vertical fashion. The bouquet consists of dried apple skin, black currant, old spice, cola, licorice, soapy lavender and road tar. It's softer than the 2004 vintage and ends with a blast of sour cherry on the close.
Melon and green apple aromas are solid and clean. The melony palate offers a plump feel and bright, sweet flavors of mango, pineapple and apple. This wine delivers a lot of fruit and liveliness on a regular frame.
The malolactic fermentation on this unoaked wine was blocked, so this is brimming with pure orange and lime flavors. The acidity is brisk and clean.
Aged four years in oak, this stately wine is adorned with layers of maple sugar, toast and smoked nuts, but its racy sour-cherry flavors shine through brightly. The backbone of this wine is taut with acidity, but bold, richly textured mouthfeel puts the palate at ease. It's sumptuous and revitalizing.
Plump mulberries and ripe black cherries meet with black sage and dark, clove-y herbs on the nose of this wine from Bentrock Vineyard. The rich, concentrated palate surrounds a dense raspberry core, proving quite lively thanks to the camphor and sage-like spice that carries deep into the finish.
A blend of 74% Syrah, 10% Carignan, 6% Grenache, 6% Mourvèdre and 4% Cinsault, this is an elegant and harmonious wine. It showcases a masterful balance between lush, ripe black berry fruits and earthy, toasty spice. With its crushed-velvet texture, bold fruit flavors and lingering spice accents, the wine is easy to appreciate and enjoy now, yet structured enough to age well for another 6–10 years.
From the folks at Thorne Clarke, this is a fine counterpart to their good-value red wines. This medium-bodied Chardonnay boasts a silky texture that easily carries the simple citrus and crushed-stone notes. Drink now.
While almost bone-dry, this Champagne has intense apple and citrus fruitiness along with a fine texture that's stylish and crisp. Extra bottle age will improve this tight, steely wine and bring out the quality of the fruit. Drink from 2014.
Sangiovese, Barbera and Sagrantino are the components in this odd blend of grapes that is redolent of simple fruit, spice and some lactic notes that recall milk chocolate. The wine has good flavor and sweet cherry succulence in the mouth.
Fragrant white flower and white stone fruit aromas leap out of the glass. On the creamy palate, a hint of crushed herb adds depth to white peach and golden apple. Fresh acidity and a foamy mousse set off the rich flavors while a suggestion of lemon drop marks the close.
An apple cider aroma comes across dusty, slightly maderized and heavy. This is a plump, wide Albariño with pithy citrus and white nectarine flavors. The finish features pithy, fleshy accents. Drink now.
A unique wine, this has sweet aromas of honeysuckle, mint and oak. Low in acidity with a medium body, it gives the impression of oiliness, and has strange muscat-like flavors with oak and sawdust hints.
This pure Cabernet does not have the sweet, forward, jammy aromatics of many red wines from this ripe vintage. It's stiff and tight, tannic and herbal, with a structure suited to play off a thick, juicy steak.
Floral and slightly earthy aromas lead to flavors that are lightly fruity and tangy. While light bodied, this wine's texture is rich enough to add an extra dimension that seems to bring out more flavor with each sip, and the finish has a lingering vanilla note. It was made from half Albariño and half Verdelho grapes.
Shimmering with the palest salmon pink, this is a softly scented, restrained but very refreshing rosé. Absolutely dry, it majors on fresh lemon notes with tart inflections of red currant. The slightest fizz helps the freshness even more. Lovely.
Fairly shy on the nose, this wine eventually shows lemon pith, lemon candy and slightly sweet aromas. The flavors start crisp but go quickly flatter, with light Pink Lady apples and a touch of orange rinds.
Melon, peach and dusty aromas give the wine a solid but flat bouquet. With soft edges and modest citric acid, it's a little dull and disjointed as it stresses melon and apple flavors. As Argentine SBs go, this is expensive for what it offers.
At this score and this price, it's a shame there isn't more of this bargain to go around (only 850 cases were imported). This epitomizes the good aspects of inexpensive Australian Chardonnay, offering pear, pineapple and melon aromas, tropical fruit flavors and just a hint of oak, then finishing clean and citrusy. Drink now.
The nose is a subdued but evocative blend of rose petal, peach, lemon and mirabelle. The palate shows a similarly easy interplay of flavors on a concentrated, harmonious and off-dry body. This is fresh and fruity, lively and enticing.
This is a savory, elegant, concentrated effort that doesn't show too much sweetness. Dark fruit, spice, black olive and tobacco notes appear on the silky close.
Jammy, sweet aromas conjure notes of a rose garden in bloom, but the palate is more scattered. On offer is basic cherry, raisin and cotton candy. Sweet on the finish, yet good in a simple way.
This is full of botrytis influence, yet is it lighter and fresher than some other Burgenland sweet wines. It leaves a feeling of lemon acidity to go with the honey- and flower-scented finish. Screwcap.
Nice and dry, with lots of black pepper-infused wild blackberry flavors wrapped into big but pliant tannins. Lots of crunchy acidity, too, which makes the wine sharp. Will be great with a rich steak.
When Petite Sirah is at its best, and this one is, it offers incomparable structure and flavors. Nothing quite like it anywhere, with its inky dark color, big, thick tannins and ripe, exuberant flavors of berries, currants, mocha, leather, tobacco, cedar and peppery spices. What's especially nice about this bottling is the dryness and moderate alcohol. A superior wine that should age for the better part of a decade.
While Colombo's Les Abeilles is a more traditional Rhône blend, this offering marries 70% Viognier with 30% Roussanne. The result is a medium-bodied wine hinting at honeyed peaches and tinged with anise that seems to be on a fast-developing course. Drink it over the next several months.
Dusty and tight, with a whiff of coffee and cocoa introducing an elegant wine with interesting streaks of metal and graphite. Young fruit and fine tannins are in perfect balance, and the wine has a lovely delicacy.

The Sauvignon Blanc in this three-grape blend dominates, creating aromas of canned peas and nettles. In the mouth, it's round, smooth and just citrusy enough, with a grassy flavor that's mixed with melon and peach notes. It feels round and solid on the finish.

A crisp, red-fruit flavored wine that has sufficient structure to give it shape and density. It is fruity with spice from the wood aging. Acidity at the end keeps it fresh and bright. Drink from 2017.
A very rich Sauvignon Blanc that shows the creamy, smoky influence of oak barrels and lees. It's dry and soft, with flavors of citrus fruits, figs, buttered toast and white pepper.
A lightly sparkling blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Gros Manseng, this is soft and just sweet. It is delicious, packed with apple, pear juice and tangy lime flavors. A great summer apéritif. Screwcap.
Made from Pinot Noir grapes, this drinks drier than the producer's Whole Cluster rosé. A burst of Maraschino cherry flavor leads into candied fruit notes, finishing clean and simple. It's a good quaffer that should be drunk well chilled.
A smooth creamy textured wine, the fruit flavors softened by ripeness and an edge that is just sweet. Good acidity gives it a fresh streak, the flavors of white currants, green plums and grapefruit coming out of a smoky edge. Screwcap.
Earth, spice and plum combine around a lean frame that's dusty and sublime in this high-acid wine that features a muscular, caramel-laced finish. In balance, this is lovely and food friendly.
The wine served at Vienna's famed Opera Ball, this is crisp, herbaceous with apple and citrus fruits already showing a totally refreshing character. It would benefit from a few months in bottle. Screwcap.
Passerina is a little-known grape from central Italy that offers good structure and density in the mouth. It's not necessarily aromatic, but it does offer tones of almond skin, butterscotch and Golden Delicious apple.
Inky, black aromas of asphalt, licorice and shoe polish hit hard, and the alcohol is immediately evident. This is gigantic in the mouth and carries some burn, but flavors of coffee, chocolate cake and wild berry are exotic and finish firm and generous, with multiple layers. Drink this ripe Malbec through 2018.
The label reads “The finest wine of Chateau Rollat Winery” and indeed it is, though in 2006 the immediate show-stopping appeal of the 2005 has been muted, or at least postponed. Here are nuanced, stacked flavors that subsume the berry and cassis fruit under herbs, earth and stone. The aromas are lively with lovely floral notes, primary grape smells, and juicy berries, but the wine is too young to see it completely. The kiss of chocolate in the finish tastes like a blessing.
This juicy, exuberant 100% Cabernet comes from one of Northern California's special spots for the variety. Given 20 months in French oak, 60% of it new, the wine offers vanilla, black cherry and clove around sizable tannins and medium acidity. It finishes soft.
A serious, oak-influenced Godello with smooth aromas of baked apple, wood resin, vanilla, spice and green melon. The palate has weight and fine acidity, so it's tight despite delivering a blast of oaky flavor. Alongside that resiny taste, there's green banana and peach notes. Fresh but woody; should age well for at least another 18 months.
The wine comes from silex soil around the small village of Saint-Andelain. Crisply textured, it has vanilla and spice flavors to fill out the intense acidity. The aftertaste, still young, brings in a steely tight texture. Drink from 2018.
A big step up from the first time we tried this wine in 2007. Aromas are pure and fruity, while the palate is ripe and acid-rich, with juicy but tight plum, herb and berry flavors.

Sweet in caramelized oak, this Chard also has jammy flavors of pears and apricots.
Rustic, earthy aromas of tomato, herbs and leather are not textbook clean but they stir interest. This is hard and tannic, with gritty, raw flavors of spicy herbal plum. On the finish, this smacks down hard with tannic bite along with chocolate and herbal spice flavors.
A blend of Cabernet, Merlot and Grenache that can only be described as strange. The nose is stewy, the palate full of root beer, baked berries and syrup. It's even cloying on the finish. Yet through all that there's still a little something redeeming about it.
This is slightly sweet, moderately fruity and smooth in texture. Light aromas of peaches and flowers lead to flavors like sugared honeydew melon. It would match with cheese or spicy Asian food.
Not showing well, with a heavy fullness of jammy berry-cherry fruit and strong tannins. Sweet oak sticks out like a sore thumb. Its future is hard to predict. Most wines that age gracefully start out impressive. This one just tastes overwrought. The score reflects crossed fingers for improvement.
Sheltered by a coastal range of hills from the Atlantic Ocean, this vineyard has produced a ripe soft wine that has gentle tannins and succulent red fruits. The aftertaste is fresh, continuing the fruit theme. The wine is ready to drink.
A richly soft, creamy wine, dominated by flavors of white currants and chives, this is full-bodied and still young. There is enough ripe acidity and full-flavored fruit to see it develop well over five years.
Opens with a foxy, jumpy, jammy set of aromas. The palate is also jammy and amorphous, with candied berry flavors and a drab, tangy, almost peppery finish.
A sappy, jammy nose offers a nice entry to this simple blend of Cabernet and Merlot. The palate feel is regular and healthy, while the flavors run toward generic red fruits with a touch of green herbs and caramel. Snappy and crisp on the finish.

Smells oaky, with smoky vanilla and sweet, charred notes riding high over flamboyant tropical fruit aromas, including guavas and breadfruit. This is a big wine, but the pieces aren't all in place. It's like a symphony orchestra playing different tunes. Give it a few months to knit together.
A soft, clean, fruity wine, with spice and a fresh, aromatic character. The lemon and white fruit flavors are in an easy, apéritif style, with a lightly sweet aftertaste.
Fairly hot and heavy at first, as alcohol blows up your nostrils. But let it settle and you'll get dark, sultry aromas of leather and black plum in front of edgy, mildly citric cassis and red plum flavors. The blend is Carmenère, Petit Verdot and Shiraz, which is not something found on every shelf. Like its Cab Franc-Petit Verdot partner, Anke Blend-2 is good but not great.
A Merlot-Cabernet blend that starts out a little awkward and then really finds its legs. This is a perfect “beginner's” Bordeaux, in that it's fruity, clean and precise. The lack of complexity and high-end nuances doesn't hurt it at all. A little overoaked, but with airing out it tastes quite good. And it has the stuffing to match with hearty foods. Best Buy.
The cru wine is soft, full of cherry fruits and with a light touch of tannin. With its fruit, it is open and generous with a crisp aftertaste. Drink now.

Grapefruit and other citrusy aromas come with a dusty note. This shows peachy weight, then leesy flavors of stone fruits and mango that are soft and lightly oxidized.
A ripe, gentle wine, with some sweet fruits touched by honey. The texture has apple skins as well as creaminess. The finale is soft, full in the mouth.
Sizable tannins and oak make for a full-bodied experience that comes off closed and tight at first, the wine needing some time in the glass to unwind. With patience, it unpeels layers of soft, floral aromas and quiet notions of raspberry and strawberry.
Huge and extracted, with an opaque purple color and a massive, aggressive nose that hints at stewed fruit, sweaty leather, blackberry compote and shoe polish. Forget elegance and go straight for this wine's unbridled size and density. If that sounds unappealing, pass it by.
Given the great potential of the 2015 vintage, it's reassuring to see that some big brands have scored successes like this. Explosive aromas of lime, tangerine and pink grapefruit burst from the glass, followed by ample citrus flavors. There's a hint of herbaceousness that grounds it in Marlborough, along with a long, passion fruit finish.
Saint Clair's Reserve and single-block bottlings are consistently top-notch, and this concentrated Sauvignon maintains that tradition. Scents of fresh herbs, nectarine and pineapple give way to intense flavors of stone fruit. It's medium- to full-bodied, with a long finish that's fresh without being overly herbal. Drink through the end of 2008.
Aromas of vanilla, cherry and cola start this impressive Cabernet Franc from Cooper. On the palate, pepper, cherry and spice is balanced and assertive. A lingering finish of cedar and plum adds to the appeal.
A blend of Oakville, Rutherford and Calistoga, this Cab shows a classic Napa profile. The most beautifully ripe cassis and black cherries are the flavors, with a chocolate edge enriched with classy, smoky oak, and the tannins are wonderfully rich and detailed. It doesn't seem like an ager, but if you're looking for an immaculate Cab tonight, this is the one.

Made in a ripe, appealing style, this has rich flavors of pineapple jam, tropical fruit, vanilla and buttered toast, brightened by crisp acidity.
A fruit-forward nose belies the chewy tannins and more serious leather tones that come through in the mouth. Acidity stands out on the medium finish. Give it a year or two for better integration, then try with a grilled steak.
Very sweet in sugary blackberry jam and chocolate flavors, brightened with good acidity. Wants for greater concentration and complexity.
Some yeasty funk hits the nose first. Underneath that sits and earthy, if slender, dry Riesling which has a subtle understated richness that seems very firmly anchored in earth. Pithy citrus zest frames and illuminates and promises future pleasure. This needs a little bottle age. Drink 2018–2030.
A thoroughly good Cabernet that represents a welcome return to form after a disappointing period for the winery in the mid-2000s. Dry, rich and dramatically structured, this cellarworthy wine has impressive flavors of blackberries and cassis, with earthier notes of black olive tapenade and cedarwood. Could easily score even higher down the road.

Cidery, yeasty, grassy aromas are the opening on this round Cava that could use a bit more cut. Cidery, briny stone-fruit and apple flavors come with a celery note, finishing dry and with a white pepper accent.
A soft, open wine, kept together by its dry tannins. Good black fruits, fresh acidity and an attractive smoky character.
This is a disjointed wine with mismatched aromas of natural rubber, talc powder, cherry cola and licorice. The mouthfeel is sharp and bright and the wine tastes tart and crisp on the close.
Soupy, rustic aromas of tomato and herbs feed into a scratchy palate with juicy, borderline raw acidity. Flavors of baked plum, peppercorn and brown sugar finish herbal and spicy.
The aromas are not in your face, and that's what makes them more seductive: delicate melon and stone fruit have floral notes at the edges. Plush and creamy in the mouth, with zippy freshness at the end. Imported by J&L; Wine Imports.
Extended time in all new French oak barrels give this wine a heartier feel than it might otherwise have, swirls of oaky caramel and toast most prominent on the nose and initial palate. A richness of color also stands out, while velvety tannins and red fruit complete the experience. Letting the wine open helps temper its size, revealing a measured level of refinement.
In this vintage, Monsanto's flagship wine, made from 90% Sangiovese Grosso, is a prime example of traditional Chianti. It features racy, dry cherry fruit, hard edges and structure galore. Whether it will evolve into a more open and friendly wine remains to be seen; normally Il Poggio ages well and improves in the bottle.

The style is crisp, with apples and grapefruit, followed by a light touch of caramel. The wine is taut, treading the high wire of tense acidity, but it also has a vivid final mineral and apple skin texture.
From young vines, this is a somewhat austere, ungenerous rendering of Pinot Noir. The tannins are a bit drying, offsetting the attractive flavors of cola, plum and fresh minty herbs.

This structured, concentrated wine is from an estate in the north of Saint-Estèphe. A dominance of Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend lends it firm, solid tannins as well as a juicy black-currant note. It's a wine for long-term aging; don't drink before 7–8 years.
Why not? The label says it all. You can pair this wine with simple chicken dishes, whether grilled, barbecued or cubed in a Chinese Chicken salad. The aromas here are simple, refreshing and recall citrus, peach and pineapple but otherwise this is a generic white wine with no varietal or territorial distinction.
From 65% Cabernet Sauvignon and 35% Zin, this is a deceptively elegant wine wrapped in a full-bodied, richly layered package.

Toasty upfront, with blatant oak and vanilla scents, but the wood is matched by the wine's fruity—raspberry and blackberry—intensity. This is lip-smacking, mouthwatering stuff that can be drunk now and over the next 10 years.
This perfumed ripe wine is full of delicious fruit. Its fine apple and pear flavors are cut with pink grapefruit to give an intensely textured wine, refreshing, crisp and ready to drink.
Piercing black cherry and cassis aromas are a touch rustic and massive, but hey, that's old-vines Carignan from Maule (this one also contains 12% Cinsault). So saturated that it's beastly on the palate, this tastes of hard-rolling blackberry and black plum. Plenty of gritty spice, tomato and integrated oak fill out the menu. Drink through 2025.
Young and still integrating its lush barrel flavors, this savory Chardonnay should hit its peak in another two or three years. The fruit is full and fleshy, a generous mix of citrus, stone and tropical fruits. Creamy and nicely textural in the mouth, it has the grip and acidity to keep it poised and detailed through a long finish.
Spicy and fruity, this light, balanced wine has easy, crisp fruit and bright acidity showing citrus and spiciness. It is a refreshing wine, ready to drink now.
A relatively light and civilized version of a notoriously dark and full-bodied varietal. The color is a medium purple. An aroma of grilled vegetables leads to satisfying cherry flavors carried on a moderately tannic but not extreme texture.
The wine has been heavily extracted, giving an initial bitter coffee and a dry tannic character. The fruit weight will compensate for this, bringing out acidity, black plums and rich berries. It has the right concentration to age, so drink from 2017.

The oak (21 months spent in French and American) takes the lead, with aromas of baking spices, green wood and vanilla out in front of cherry. The flavors are sweet, supported by grainy tannins that show some dryness.
Really taut, tight wine, its mature toastiness embedded in a steely, mineral, very dry texture. The acidity is assertive, wonderfully refreshing, so crisp. It may be 18 years old, but it looks likely to age for several years yet.
This north-facing slope planted to seven clones of Pinot Noir seems to produce better wines every year. The 2013 is medium-bodied yet creamy-textured and lush, with black cherry fruit framed by cedar and vanilla. It's silky and vibrant on the finish, making it a treat to drink already.
Guigal is now making 40-45% of the entire Condrieu appellation, making the quality of this cuvée quite an achievement. Floral notes lead off, followed by hints of peach, apricot and honey, and the wine walks the requisite balance between round lushness and peppery, minerally spice. Drink now-2012.
Just a touch of fresh citrus plays on the nose, but the palate delivers textured mouthfeel and peppery, leafy freshness. Although the acidity is cushioned, the wine is refreshing and leaves a super-clean finish.
This soft, open wine has a light fruit character with attractive acidity and a crisp aftertaste. Drink now.
Candied honeydew, lime, bubblegum and crushed chalk show on the nose of this bottling. The acidity is razor-sharp and the palate's squeaky-clean texture is compelling, with flavors of lemon-lime soda and grapefruit pith to round it out.
This small 24-acre property has produced a powerful, rich 2010 that layers its big black-plum flavor with complex tannins and wood notes. Dry and firm, it is still defiantly young and needs several years to round out.

A big, spicy wine, packed with new wood as well as ripe, soft fruit. It's smooth, polished and balanced. Fine tannins add to the structure.
The vineyard lies between Freestone and Bodega Bay, one of the coolest parts of the far Sonoma Coast. The wine is fairly pale for a California Pinot Noir, with nuanced flavors of toast, spices, raspberries and persimmons, in a silky, vibrant texture. The oak application has not yet been fully integrated. Give it 2–4 years in the bottle.
This starts out well, with soft, plummy fruit. It then turns a corner into an odd, lingering finish with residual flavors of sour fruit, plastic and gun metal.
93-95. Barrel sample. This wine has richness, weight and dark tannins, with balanced fruit and a ripe mouthfeel. It's powered by spice and blackberry flavors.
Yellow in color, this blend of 80% Macabeo and 20% Sauvignon Blanc smells waxy, with notes of lanolin, peach and papaya. It's sharp and fairly austere on the tongue, with tart, lemony flavors that end pithy, citric and slightly bitter. Drink immediately.
Pure and intense up front, with dry, nutty core aromas and not too much blatant oxidation. Fresh and kicking in the mouth, but still fairly smooth, with nutty, toasty flavors and a hint of baked apple. Nutty, creamy and not too acidic or scouring on the finish.
Matthew Loso makes excellent Sauvignon Blanc, and this is no exception. Smooth, lush and creamy, it's bursting with concentrated fruit flavors of apple, peach and papaya—definitely not a grassy style by any measure. Everything points to barrel fermentation, including the lick of fresh cream in the finish.
Concentrated on the nose, with plum, berry and aged cheddar cheese aromas. The palate is snappy and nicely balanced, with clean, basic raspberry and cherry flavors. Pleasant throughout; doesn't reach too far; tasty and correct.
Made entirely with Sangiovese, this offers aromas of truffle, underbrush, dark berry and fragrant purple flower. The bright, juicy palate doles out succulent Marasca cherry, black raspberry, clove and a hint of game while supple tannins provide balance and lithe support. It's not loaded with complexity but it is delicious. Enjoy through 2018.
It's awfully hard to make a really good Pinot Noir for less than, say, $30. This wine tries hard. It shows true Pinot character in the dry, silky mouthfeel, crisp acids and pleasant fruit flavors, which finish with coffee and cocoa.
Zocker flies under the radar with this Austrian variety, but insiders understand. The winery consistently produces one of the best in California. The wine leans toward the style of today's dry, unoaked, low alcohol and crisply acidic white wines, with complex flavors of citrus fruit, nectarine, peach, honey and minerals.
Sourced from a delineated section of this sloped, expansive vineyard, this Pinot has a fair amount of peppery herb, along with brambly berry flavor. It's tart, spicy and sharp, but beautifully balanced. Still quite young and tight, this one needs plenty of breathing time, or cellar it for a few more years.
Murno Pinot Grigio has an extra layer of depth in terms of its aromas: mineral, floral and fruit tones play off each other with ease. In the mouth, this creamy wine offers intensity and impressive staying power.
Rich, dense and intense, this is a big, muscular rendering of Barossa Shiraz. Scents of maple syrup and menthol intertwine with flavors of ripe plums and grilled meat. It's mouthcoating and long on the tannic finish, so give it some time in the cellar; drink 2020–2030.
At the western edge of the main Port vineyards, this estate is as well placed for fine wine as for Port. This richly structured Touriga Nacional has attractive acidity, perfumed black fruit and robust, tight tannins. With its wood aging, it's made to age. Drink from 2021.
Bravo to Feudo Arancio for producing a Nero d'Avola of this caliber at such an attractive price point. Its nose is rich with floral and rose-like notes backed by blueberry and vanilla. The structure is firm and the tannins give backbone. It's informal but refined at the same time. Imported by Prestige Wine Imports Corp.
A delicious Pinot, but not particularly complex. With direct, primary cherry marmalade and jellied mint flavors, accented with a bit of oak, it's dry and crisp. Drink now.
Cembali is usually a spot on expression of Nero d'Avola, one of Sicily's best and most elaborate, but the 2005 vintage definitely seems on the overripe, alcoholic and jammy side. Ripe fruit aromas, toasted oak and smoked beef jerky push forth from the nose.
A rich and jammy wine that has ripe tannins that form a backdrop to the generous black fruits. Produced from old vines, the wine shows a rich and concentrated character. The aftertaste is punctuated by fresh acidity.
This is a very pleasant Barbera from the Monferrato zone with good concentration and bright aromas of blueberry, wild fruit, wet earth and hazelnut. There's good dimension here as well as a smooth texture that is accented by the wine's natural acidity.
Tastes like ripeness ran away with this wine. The blackberry flavors are explosive, making it taste like jam, while the oak is very strong, almost overpowering in smoky char. Pretty good, but overworked. Drink soon.

Tan in color, this has fleshy, almondy aromas. It feels flat and creamy, with soft, lightly oxidized flavors of mealy apple and walnut oil. This is past its prime.
Dark and charred, with aromas of shoe polish, asphalt, coconut and blackberry. It's masculine in style, with firm tannins that bite down in support of concentrated black fruit, chocolate and spice flavors. Coffee, bitterness and heat work the finish on this tannic, full-bodied Cabernet.
A complex blend of Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Weissburgunder, this is a rich, spicy wine, dry in style and with some tannins. It has weight and density, but doesn't lose its creamy, fresh texture and acidity. It should age another year in bottle to get the best out of this serious wine.
A bright fruity nose of tart cherry and cranberry yields to surprisingly sophisticated flavors of ripe black cherry, blackberry, coffee and white chocolate. Mouth-coating tannins are at play on the palate, culminating in a finish marked by a lingering sense of zestiness.
Negroamaro Maru is characterized by simple, sweet-tasting fruit aromas of blackberry jelly and raspberry. Those pretty fruit flavors are backed by soft tannins and a chewy texture.
Blending distinction with sheer pleasure, the bouquet opens with scents of green, black, and Kalamata olives, sage, forest floor and slate. Those aromas translate remarkably to the palate, which is a potpourri of dried herbs and wet earth. There are barely any overt fruit characteristics, and the savory, sophisticated result is simply delicious.
Perbruno opens with spicy notes of black pepper, clove and Christmas spice that make a bold and delicious first impression. After a few minutes, it delivers notes of black fruit, cherry, pipe tobacco and leather. Oak shadings give the wine a dense and rich finish.
Aromas of honey and lemon lead into semi-dry flavors of tropical fruit and citrus on the palate, Refreshing in character with a spicy undertone, the wine still has a semi-sweet, fruity roundness that can handle richer dishes. Pair with lobster, shellfish.
Not too concentrated, but what there is is pretty. Peach and apple flavors have gentle oak shadings, and the wine is creamy and dry.
Cloudy red in color, with musky berry aromas. The palate shows some cherry and raspberry, while the feel is sort of rough. A classic country wine that isn't about to rock anyone's world.

Meaty black fruit, cherry, blueberry and plum set the stage for what is a youthful and fruit-driven Sicilian red. The wine has an informal personality that would pair well with hamburgers or pasta.
One of the oldest wines submitted, a deliciously complex créme brûlèe, coconut, nutmeg, vanilla and smoke bouquet opens this classy contender. Full and creamy on the palate, it offers rich, finely nuanced pear and nectarine fruit flavors accented by clove, nutmeg and coconut. Still feels young, finishing long and bold with intriguing spice and tangy pineapple notes.
Made from selected parcels of Gamay, this structured wine offers both fruit and fresh acidity. It has a dry core, giving a solid wine with some aging potential. Aromatic and fresh red fruits complete a wine that will be better from 2016.
Estate grown, this is the only white from the Wayfarer Vineyard out on the Fort Ross-Seaview coast, and it's stunning. Culled from several distinct blocks planted to a handful of clones, including Mt. Eden and Old Wente, the aromas are pretty in orange blossom and peach, the body expansive and flinty. Succulent, the wine offers a lot of layered complexity, making it enjoyable now and through 2020–2022.

Plummy fruit supported by cocoa and herb notes and a decadent, overripe quality seen in no other 1998s. The ripe, supple mouthfeel provides sweet, if not overly nuanced, fruit. Finishes long, with even tannins and sweet-tart chocolate and licorice flavors. Hold a year; drink through 2006.
There's deep density to the aromas of this wine, with black olive, crushed lava rocks and baked black-plum scents. An herbal kick to the front of the palate conveys bay leaf and oregano, followed by rich blackberry, turned loam and black-rock flavors.
High-toned and sharp, this Cabernet features sleek berry and cassis fruit. On the palate it feels both slightly hot and acidic; it needs decanting. If you like some spice and plenty of new oak, this is a good choice.
Freshly aromatic, this is a Portuguese equivalent of a Gewürztraminer. It has all the lychees and spice as well as a thick, almost viscous texture. Good acidity helps the balance. Delicious, as an apéritif or with Asian food.
EQ is a consistent leader among Chilean Pinots. This vintage shows high-toned, edgy aromas of currant and spice. It's quite full in body, with a resiny, creamy oak note that should settle in the near future. Woody, ripe-berry flavors finish round, with a mild sense of chocolaty richness. Drink through 2018.

This ruby-colored Amarone offers medium intensity and sightly disjointed aromas of spice, leather and candied fruit. The nicest element, however, is the crisp cherry freshness that peeps through on the finish.

A 100% varietal expression of the grape, this is soft and simple, medium bodied and quite tannic, with highlights of green herb and tomato leaf.
Bright and straightforward, it opens with aromas of tropical fruit and cut grass. The palate delivers flavors of white grapefruit and lime alongside zesty acidity. Pair with asparagus risotto.
The fresh berry aromas are solid, and the palate is plucky and lively, with plenty of acidity to push the ripe, standard Malbec flavors of blackberry and spice. It shows some tartaric crispness and bite on the finish, but tastes right.
Vanilla, cocoa, graphite, woodspice and black cherry aromas lead to polished blackberry and cherry flavors in this Cabernet. It shows a fine balance and texture that piques interest, and a distinctive spice note that lingers on the finish.

This is an estate-grown blend of 80% Grenache, 15% Syrah and 5% Viognier from the great vineyard site, savory in spicy white pepper, blueberry and a persistence of cinnamon and clove. Floral aromas and a delicate texture provide a memorable experience on the palate, finishing in a tease of tobacco.
Orange-pink in color, the Champagne tastes mature, rich, its fruit changed into a complex series of toast and bagel flavors. It is soft, with some sweetness, still finished with acidity.
This Harlequin has a faint scent of lemon liqueur that's offset by a white pepper note. The medium-weight palate offers a lemon blossom hint, and it finishes on the short side.
Forward and fruity, this is a solid, drink any time Chardonnay. It's built in a blocky chunky mode, but some sleek lime flavors put a polished edge on the underlying acids.
This is a big, young, rather tough Cab, tannic and thick. The blackberry flavors have to swim up to the surface from murky depths. But it's dry and balanced, and has the stuffing for the cellar. Best after 2008.
Planeta set out to make a great white wine on the volcanic slopes of Mt. Etna using the indigenous Carricante grape. The results are chiseled and clean, with pristine aromas of zesty citrus, herbal nuances and rain-soaked slate roof.
Briary strawberry and tea aromas are light on the nose. The palate is modest and juicy in feel, with peppery, slightly bitter plum and cherry flavors.
Peach, melon and citrus aromas are good but standard. This is edgy and sharp due to lean pointy acidity. As a result of that acidity, this is tart and citric in flavor, with little lees or yeasty richness to soften things up. A finish with stony, dry lime flavors is scouring.
Heavy oak, asphalt, chocolate and slightly weedy berry aromas open this blend of Garnacha Tintorera, Monastrell and Syrah. In the mouth, rubbery tannins create astringency. Fully oaked, spicy berry flavors include vanilla and clove notes, while an oak-dominated finish tastes creamy and herbal.

Baseball card bubble gum and leafy spearmint aromas shade dark, dusty fruit notes, while the tannic palate houses mildly tart cherry flavors followed by hints of sucking candy and finally coffee. Decent but a bit overoaked and out of sorts.
This 95% Cabernet Sauvignon with the balance of Merlot, Syrah and Malbec, is immediately accessible with notes of char, roasted coffee bean and cherry. The palate is rich, chocolaty and seamlessly stitched together.
Rich and soft, this is a wine that's developing fast. It has the right weight, with flavors of yellow fruits, mangos and white stone fruits. Its attractive fruitiness dominates, while the more tangy aspects that characterize Riesling are missing.
Deliciously perfumed wine, full of the ripest fruit along with smoky tannins. It revels in the bright fruit flavors that add to the pleasure. This is a wine that will develop relatively quickly, although it will age as well.

The wine offers sweet aromas of mature cherry and blackberry backed by almond and very light touches of dried tobacco. It has an easygoing but smooth mouthfeel.
Simple and direct in oaky, fruity pineapple and lemon jam flavors, this Chardonnay tastes a little sweet. It's made in the modern style, appealing if not particularly complex. Drink now.

Like so many producers and négociants, Bouchard Père has a slice of the action in this famed Grand Cru. Its interpretation is generous, going for the inherent richness from the terroir. This is a magnificently ripe wine, definitely opulent, with the generous wood enhancing the very ripe fruit. In all this splendor, it is good to find a delicious edge of acidity.
This earthy wine opens with aromas of wild red berry, wet soil and a gamey note. The vibrant palate offers juicy red cherry while touches of cinnamon, dried herb and orange zest add interest.
From vineyards in both Alexander Valley and Bennett Valley, the grapes were fermented in French oak for eight months, a minority of it new. This is a medium-bodied, integrated wine rich in caramel apple and fresh-squeezed tangerine. Brisk and in balance, it finishes with a note of toasted almond.
This opens with unusual aromas of celery, medicinal herb, saline and a vegetal note with the barest whisper of dark fruit in the background. The unusual medicinal aromas carry over to the palate along with a hint of candied cherry and menthol before finishing abruptly, leaving a bitter aftertaste.
A ripe while herbal wine, this is crisp and full of grapefruit and gooseberry fruits. Tangy with lively acidity, it is aromatic with white flowers and has a fresh, fruity aftertaste. Drink now.
With a bright cherry color and juicy flavors, this is a well-integrated blend of Zweigelt and Blaufränkisch. The wood aging is obvious but not dominant, and adds pleasant spice to the fruit. A firm structure promises aging, so drink from 2015. Screwcap.
Seems to have almost a hint of acetate on the nose, but there's no evidence of volatility on the mildly creamy palate, where bright cherry fruit is accented by cracked peppercorns. Turns a bit chewier on the finish, but remains balanced. Drink 2008–2014.
This is a dry, crisp and very elegant Sauvignon Blanc. It shows savory flavors of lemons, limes and lemongrass, girded with a fine, structural minerality. Super-clean, it's a terrific partner to grilled shrimp, bruschetta with veggies and garlic, a ham sandwich, broiled chicken with rice, you name it.
Very ripe aspects inform the nose: ripe honeyed peach and pear dominate. The palate, on the other hand, is a picture of citric slenderness and steely concentration of freshness. Its absolute dryness highlights the brisk, clean and lemon-driven style perfectly. This is wonderfully bracing and cleansing and so very refreshing. Lovely now but sure to develope. Drink now through 2025.
Big, oaky and concentrated, it's rich in coffee and leathery toffee, the tannins firm and feisty.
Pale peach in color, the aromas bring bright notes of passion fruit, guava and strawberry. It drinks dry, but with plenty of kiwi and other tropical-fruit flavors bringing a sense of sweetness. Distinctly fruit forward for a rosé, it delivers a lot of appeal, despite occasionally seeming a bit weighty.
Shows the classic pepper aroma of a fine Northern Rhône wine, and the tannic structure is impressive, but the blackberry and currant fruit flavors finish on the sweet side. That makes the wine taste rustic, almost faulty. May be a function of high alcohol, residual sugar, or both.
Crushed sea shells and chalk meet with lemon blossoms, citrus rinds, baked pears and a touch of butter on the nose of this excellent bottling. Juicy lemon and brisk salinity drive the palate, with judicious acid cutting through the Gravenstein apple and lightly roasted macadamia nut flavors.
Spectacular, with opening young wine characteristics displaying naturally tart, spicy mixed red fruits. New barrel flavors of chocolate, smoke and toast are out in front, but right behind is glorious fruit—fully ripe, sweet and succulent, concentrated and rich. It finishes gracefully with nuances of iron filings and fresh herb.
Santomè is a pretty expression of Raboso (a native grape of northeast Italy) with mouth-coating tannins and bright aromas of black cherry, old leather, spice and clove. That firm structure suggests a pairing with succulent red meat.
Here is a sweet and fragrant dessert wine with aromas of white flower, honey and stone fruit accented by a slightly drying mineral characteristic. Firm, tonic effervescence keeps the palate refreshed even when paired with whipped cream or creamy fruit desserts.
This is the winery's reserve bottling, representing the best five barrels of the vintage. Supple and refined, it frames its young berry fruit flavors in elegant tannins. Nicely focused and still a bit raw, this wine will reward some further years of aging.
Made entirely from Cabernet Sauvignon, this stylish wine opens with aromas of red berry, Mediterranean herb and cedar. The juicy, elegantly structured palate doles out red currant, black raspberry, licorice and white pepper alongside silky tannins. Drink now–2024.
94-96 Barrel sample. Lots of new wood here, maybe too dominant. But it is a stage, because the fruit weight is also there to give a wine of considerable complexity, dry and solid.
A grippy, densely concentrated and full-bodied wine, which will benefit from vigorous swirling or cellaring, there are hints of black fruit, leather saddle and cedar at its edges, waiting to grow wings. Drink now through 2023.
Herbal briny aromas of black olive and roasted black fruits lead to a choppy raw palate. This tastes of herbal berry fruits and olive, with a touch of eucalyptus. Rubbery dry tannins result in scratchiness on the finish.
Under the watchful eye of consultant Eric Delacroix, the Bazin twins (Thierry and Odile) created a wine that is dark and dense. This is a young wine with good potential. Its black fruits and solid tannins are rich and structured. Acidity and ripeness go together and will let the wine develop well. Drink from 2019.
What a combination—quality on par with some of Australia's top performers at a price point that doesn't put you on the bread line. Lively, with brisk acidity, the Bin 7 has lime, grass and mineral notes and just enough viscosity to remind you that it's Riesling, not Sauvignon Blanc. Finishes long and fresh, with sour apple flavors.  Editors' Choice.
The Savoy Vineyard is one of the best in Anderson Valley. In capable hands like Roessler's, it yields classic California coastal Pinot Noir. This '06 is young and tight in acidity, but explosive in flavors, swamping the mouth with cherries, orange peel, red licorice, beef jerky and other savory umami flavors. Just delicious, but young. Best 2009–2012.
A solid combination of Chenin's curvy, honeyed flavors and the clean crispness of Sauvignon Blanc. An affordable, dependable wine with a go-to personality for everyday enjoyment.
Bubblegummy and fresh in acidity, this rosé tastes like a young Beaujolais, with strawberry and raspberry fruit. It's an enjoyable wine to wash down little tapas plates of olives, ham, salted nuts.
A rich, lusty Zin, filled with wild berry and spice flavors, with a touch of raisins. No surprise that it's a little prickly hot, because the alcohol is way high, but that's just fine with barbecue.
From the Valpantena area, or the easternmost stretch of the Valpolicella wine zone, comes this very approachable and well-priced Ripasso from the historic Bertani winery. Aromas here include bresaola, smoked bacon, ripe fruit, plums, prunes and mesquite wood. The wine is more subtle and elegant in the mouth and ends with a playful touch of cracked black pepper.
Here's an impressive new wine from Bolgheri with an inky, dense appearance and concentrated aromas of black fruit, spice, leather, tar and licorice. The wine shows depth and personality, capped by a velvety texture and long, fruit-driven persistency.
This is very rich and complicated, with oak and lees adding creamy, smoky notes to the ripe citrus, peach and pear flavors. It seems a little candied, in the California way, but it's clean and varietally proper.
Reverie's vineyards are on a particularly high, steep slope of the mountain, and they make for wines that are tough in tannins when young, as this one is. It's also very dry, and feels astringently unsatisfying. Most California Merlots are not aging wines, but this one has a solid core of fruit, and might emerge from its coma for a window between 2007 and 2009.
A Sangiovese-based blend named for the expression “Call me Crazy,” this wine also contains small amounts of Merlot, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon. Crazy or not, it works, providing a thicket of black and blue berry, smoky cinnamon and a juicy, medium build, meant to please, not to over-ponder.
This is a very rich Chardonnay marked by creamy, leesy, butter and oak notes that give it an exotic sweetness. But it's bone-dry, and the underlying fruit is powerful enough to stand up to all that bling. Just delicious in pineapple, pear marmalade, crème brûlée and spice flavors.
Very dry and fairly tannic, it's severe on first sip and hard to appreciate, although there are some good black cherry, cola, leather, oak and black pepper flavors. It's complex in its own way, and gets better as it breathes in the glass. Give it a good, long decanting, and drink it now through 2018. The blend is Mourvèdre, Grenache, Syrah and Counoise, in that order.
Packaged in what looks like a solid gold bottle, this easy sparkler offers fresh acidity and clean fruit aromas. The gold packaging gives this particular bottle a sassy, luxurious competitive edge.
A light and fruity wine that is ready to drink. From the heart of the Entre-deux-Mers region, it has red berry fruits and juicy acidity. A greener, herbal character in the background suggests grapes that weren't totally ripe at harvest.
This is a big, tannic and dry Syrah that seems built for the cellar, but an unripe note of green peppercorn verging on bell pepper rules that out. So drink now and appreciate the blackberries and oak.
Ordinary and one-dimensional. The grapes got superripe under the California sun, offering big flavors of pineapples and peaches, liberally accented with oak. But there's not much going on below the surface.
A brilliant Sauvignon Blanc, with racy acidity and a rich, creamy texture. Shows lemongrass, peach, melon and exotic tropical fruit flavors, and really gets those tastebuds whistling. Shows a complexity rare in this variety.
Tastes like it was just bottled, with jammy red fruit, sweet licorice, vanilla and spice flavors and a fresh burst of acidity. Almost like it's been frozen in time over the years, but not likely an ager. Drink up with barbecue, ham or pork chops.
Tough, acidic and tannic, this Cab isn't offering much pleasure now, despite some rich blackberry and currant fruit. Doesn't seem likely to develop in the cellar, so drink up.
A full, somewhat sweet wine, fresh with foamy strawberries in the mouth. The acidity is missing somewhere, but this does make for a pleasing wine, certainly a fine partner to fresh fruits.
The seven-acre walled vineyard surrounds the winery and château. Old vines and a sheltered situation give this wine its richness. Enhanced by the wood aging, this wine is ripe with apricots and spiced pears cut with a mineral texture. It is still young and will be much better from 2019.
This is a ripe, fruity wine from a village that also has vines in the Pouilly Fuissé appellation. Soft and rounded, it conveys apricot and melon flavors that are shot through with acidity. Drink the wine from 2018.
There's lots of cutting acidity in this dry Merlot. It has pleasant cherry-pie flavors, but the tartness really needs rich meats and cheeses to soften it.
Layers of smoke, toast and savory apples on the nose strike a contrast with the sweet melon and apple flavors on the palate of this dry, full-bodied Chardonnay. Reverberates to a rich, salted butter and toast note on the finish.
The nose lacks punch, offering only faint notes of melon and white flowers while the crisp, fairly dry palate sails by on fleeting notes of white raspberry and pomelo. Not one for aging.
Dark aromas of black cherry and plum are spicy and suggestive of crude oil. In the mouth, this everyday Cab shows juicy balance and clean lines. Standard black-fruit flavors come with spice notes and a harmonious, long finish.
Rich and complex, this is a densely flavored rosé. It has spice and tangerine orange zest as well as a more complex red pepper and red currant character. It is a wine for fish or ratatouille.
A 50/50 blend of Pommard and Dijon 777 grapes, this is the biggest, brightest and juiciest vintage to date for this cuvée. The concentrated raspberry fruit carries a touch of sweetness, set against refined, proportionate tannins. The mouthfeel is smooth and the finish chocolaty, with enough concentration to drink well into the mid-2020s.
Hints of smoke and savory, dried herbs add an earthy shadow to this dry, full-bodied Riesling. It's refreshing and easy drinking, with abundant lemon and lime flavors.
Dark toast, dill and tobacco frame this late-release Bordeaux-style blend, but there's still plenty of pristine black cherry and cassis flavor too. It's surprisingly fresh and fruity, balanced crisply in acidity and alcohol. The finish lingers on a sweet-tart berry tone.
Compared this to the winery's Cabernet Sauvignon, it's softer, richer and more accessible despite the big tannins that will enable the wine to age. Flavorwise, you'll find a delicious mélange of blackberry, cherry, plum, coffee and herb flavors that are intricate and complexed by flashy new oak. Drink now through 2014.
Shows the volume of this warmish, high mountain vineyard, with enormously ripe flavors of cherries, red currants and red plums, with elaborate sweet oak. Yet it preserves Pinot's silky delicacy. That juggling act, of balancing power with finesse, marks the best Pisoni Pinot Noirs. Fine now, and should slowly develop over the next six years.
The standard Sauvignon Blanc aromas of lime and mineral define the nose of this wine. It tastes juicy to an extreme, with fruit flavors of nectarine and apple that don't rise to a high level. It's tangy, candied and bright on the finish.
Slightly pink in color, this Pinot Noir-based sparkler brings appealing notes of orange blossom and pink lemonade, nearing but not quite reaching bubble-gum tropicality. It's riper than its sister Blanc de Blancs, but remains very high and tight, enlivening the mouth with acidity and sour plum flavors.
The grapes come from three very widely separated vineyard sources. The Klipsun, says winemaker Marie-Eve Gilla, is for the backbone and tannins; the Pepper Bridge gives dried herbs and tighter tannins; and the Alder Ridge is more European and fills out the midpalate. This is showing very well, and has clearly benefited from the extra bottle age. It's beautifully integrated, with the tannins substantial but polished. The fruit mixes ripe berries and moves smoothly into flavors of earth, smoke, tobacco and graphite.
Zest and floral notes abound on this refreshingly dry Chardonnay. Satisfyingly juicy and tart, it's penetrating on the palate with flavors of white grapefruit and fresh green apple. Finishes briskly but with a lingering lime-skin astringency.
Dark colored, this offers considerable wood aromas. It tastes dry and extracted, layering bitter coffee flavors on burnt toast. Mere hints of fruitiness seep through the big tannic structure.
Dry and spicy, this has lots of upfront fruit in the form of wild raspberries and cherries, and rich tannins that make it great for pairing with grilled steaks and chops.
Tart and leafy, this pure Malbec shows good grip and concentration. Sour raspberry fruit flavors and sharp acids are complemented with barrel spice from aging in once-used French oak. This tastes like a good wine from young vines; it may improve for a couple of years, but it's best for near-term drinking.
This gripping, delicious wine seamlessly weaves together sensations of blue flower, exotic incense, ripe black cherry, mature plum, cracked pepper, mocha, clove and graphite. It's already delicious and well balanced, with bracing tannins and racy acidity, but give it time to soften and develop complexity. Drink 2019–2029.
A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc, this wine is aromatically brooding, with notes of pencil lead, barrel spice, herb, medicine cabinet and cherry. The flavors are rich and full bodied, showing concentration and depth.
90–92. Barrel sample. This wine is very smoky with firm tannins typical of Saint-Estèphe. Layers of fruit surround the core of dryness in the heart of the wine. Floral and fragrant, the wine finishes with good acidity.
A particularly clean, fresh and dry rosé, full of currant fruit, a taut, refreshing texture and a final burst of acidity.
This wine veers between satisfyingly rich mango flavors and underripe green pea notes. Gooseberries hang in the balance, and they dominate, making the wine feel raw and green. But it is nicely dry and vital in acidity.
Classic citrus, grapefruit and passion fruit on the nose, with more of the same in terms of flavors. Seems a touch warm and heavy at 14.5%, but no question about the ripeness.
Combining fruit from two different ranches, as well as 11% Petite Sirah from another site, this fulsome, sultry wine broods in blackberry, vanilla and coconut, presenting itself as friendly if buxom. Broadly appealing, it's full bodied and yet restrained in terms of oak, allowing the fruit to sing.
A soft rosé, touched by crisp raspberry flavors and fresh red apple acidity. The vintage produced ripe wine, and this shows in the underlying full structure. But it is only for aging over the next 2–3 years.

Smoky and seductive in black cherry and a healthy dose of Asian spice, this wine is full-bodied and well concentrated in a thicket of blueberry and gamy meat.
Just one word for this Zin: delicious. It's really classic Dry Creek, maybe a little softer than many, but profoundly ripe in wild berry, cherry, cola, licorice, black pepper and sandalwood flavors that finish long and deep. Great price for a Zinfandel this good.
This soft and ripe wine is full of bright cherry flavors, with gentle tannins and just a hint of wood aging. A proper Pinot Noir acidity brings out the fruitiness of the wine. Drink now.

Very spicy and aromatic, this immediately stands out in the crowded field of Washington Rieslings. The ripe, tangy green fruits are wrapped in a mint/licorice candy coating; the flavors seem to gather strength and persist well into a long finish. This may not appeal to purists, but it definitely delivers a lot of clean, bracing flavor.
This Barbera is very pruney in the nose, with scents of smoked meat under the fruit. Despite the suggestion that the grapes got a little baked, there is plenty of acid, perhaps an indication that this varietal is difficult to get right in Washington State vineyards. Drink this one soon.
Aromas of toasted oak, coffee bean, anisette, dried plum and a whiff of coconut lead the nose of this blend of Sangiovese, 15% Merlot and 5% Cabernet Sauvignon. Reflecting the heat of the vintage, the palate is rather evolved and abrupt, offering dried black cherry, espresso and grilled sage but not much fruit richness. Aggressive, astringent tannins dry out the finish.
Made entirely with Grechetto, this opens with scents of acacia flower, citrus and hay. The savory palate offers yellow peach, cantaloupe and an almond note while crisp acidity gives it a clean finish.
Given sufficient time to open up, this cool-vintage wine brings notes of dried herbs, chocolate, anise, pencil lead and wood spice. The luscious chocolate and cherry flavors are soft, supple and concentrated, with enough tannins to benefit from additional time in the cellar. Drink after 2016 or give it a two-hour decant.
Tasting strongly of spicy wood, this wine is firm, with a tight, granitic texture. Tannins and acidity anchor its blackberry fruit, yielding a structured wine that is ready to drink.
This charred specimen smells resiny and of blackened oak, with grapy berry scents thrown in. In the mouth, this is rock solid and balanced. Heavily oaked resiny flavors rest on top of core blackberry fruit, while this shows woody dry tannins and salty baked berry flavors on the finish.
A full-bodied, mouth-filling wine that bursts with melon, peach, peppery pear skin and nutmeg flavors. It is ripe, rich, a fruit salad whose final freshness and acidity suggest aging for 3–5 years.

It's hard to choose a favorite amongst Harbes' 2014 Merlots but this one stands out for its finessed body and subtle spice and licorice tones.

Shows the classic structure of a fine Russian River Pinot, and Merry Edwards' way of making everything elegant. Dry and crisp, the wine displays cherry pulp and skin, cola, anise and spice flavors, wrapped into ultra-refined, velvety tannins. Doesn't seem to have the fruity focus and concentration of recent vintages, though, so drink soon.
Aromas of dark berry are potent but narrow and limited, and there's a slight note of minty grass as well. The wine is juicy, bouncy and fresh in the mouth, with dark cherry and blackberry flavors. Simple, fruity and tasty, with good balance.
This has a spicy bouquet of black pepper, nutmeg and plum punctuated by sandalwood notes. The palate is subdued, revealing bitter cherry, vanilla and coffee flavors. The finish is short, with drying tannins.

Best after 2025.

It's immense and inviting, with grabby, plump blackberry fruit along with cinnamon, mocha and cola notes. Creamy, rich and almost unctuous. Drink over the next five years. 200 cases made.
This is Rochioli's estate Pinot—without a vineyard designation. It's a fabulous wine, showing the winery's signature power, complexity and balance.

The '04 was so much better, maybe because of vintage or sourcing differences. This is sharp in green, minty tastes, and the cherry and cola flavors finish simple and thin. Earns an extra point for a rich spiciness.
Aromas of vanilla, spice box, toast and jammy red fruit are followed by quite elegant fruit flavors. The tannins seem a bit bunched up.

This is a dark, inky Petite Sirah, dense in tannins and full-bodied. It basically takes command of the palate and puts up a wall of astringency. That's young Petite Sirah for you. Behind that wall are rich flavors of blackberries and currants, with a generous sweetness from toasty oak, and finished with a hit of acidity. You should cellar this wine for at least six years.
This is the Castillon wine from the Saint-Émilion estate of Faugères, which is split in half by commune boundaries. The same care goes into this great value wine as into the Saint-Émilion, and this is a fine wine, full of superripe fruit and blackberry flavors.
Lush without being overtly oaky in aroma, this wine has a wonderful, creamy texture, lots of ripe pear and melon flavors, full body and a nicely viscous mouthfeel. Pair its richness with richness, counterpointing scallops or even a steak.

This Sauvignon Blanc comes from two areas, the Arroyo Seco, which is such a great home to dry whites, and the warmer San Lucas appellation. Blended with small amounts of the Musqué clone and Semillon, the wine is bone dry, refreshingly crisp, and a close approximation of the famous wines of New Zealand's Marlborough. The flavors, of gooseberries, limes, Meyer lemons, figs and wildflowers, are deep and impressively long-lasting.
This feels sharp and raw, with ripe, jammy blackberry and cherry flavors, plus a streak of sweet, toasty oak. Drink now.
Initially it's like a pungent strip of fresh-cut oak laid on a bed of leather, but airing reveals black cherry and blueberry flavors and a couple layers of warmth and style. Very nice weight and balance. A little oaky on the nose, but overall it's more than commendable. Imported by Vinamericas Selections.
This is a high-acid, minerality-driven wine from the wilds of Rockpile.

Black cherry and a vibrant squeeze of citrus stand out on the palate, providing juiciness and balance.

Spiced with wood and nutmeg, this elegant, fruity wine has red apple, green plum and pineapple flavors, rounded and soft.

Very aromatic, gentle, almost floral notes of Cox's Orange Pippin appear with the first whiff. They get their full due on the off-dry palate which boosts the fruit flavors and paints them in a golden light. There is grip and backbone and ample fruit. Drink while the fruit is at its height: 2016–2018. Finishes off dry.
Nuits Saint-Georges based Liger-Belair has produced a very Burgundian Beaujolais. It is full, structured and rich, now reaching its peak. Great cherry fruits allied to intense acidity are balanced by mature tannins and a firm, dense texture. The wine is ready to drink, although it could still mature further.
A distinctive flavor profile makes this vibrantly fruity and densely textured wine stand out. It packs juicy raspberries, strawberries and dark ripe blackberries into the aroma. All that fruit oozes onto the palate and lingers long on the finish.
Floral notes play above the aromatic woodruff and fig-leaf aromas which make this incredibly enticing. The palate is slender, tight and totally concentrated. This is nervy, high-octane stuff, for now boasting lemon and pink grapefruit, without a single ounce of fat—and yet this is not ungenerous.
Vintner Giovannella Fugazza has crafted a soft and plush white wine with ripe peach and candied fruit aromas. The fragrant grape used is Malvasia and the wine is sweet and chewy on the close.

Soft and lightly sweet at the end, it shows black and dried fruits, light tannins and spice from the wood aging. Drink now.
Maybe Pinot Noir isn't meant to be in Catalonia. This has a burnt nose, with medicinal cherry and cranberry aromas and flavors. Starts sweet then goes a bit raspy. Unusual.
Black in color, this smells of olive, eucalyptus and tarry berry, much like you'd get from a high-end Chilean red. An extracted massive palate is dense and layered, while this tastes of salty black plum and black currant. A toasty smooth finish with mild tannins is herbal and balsamic. Drink through 2021.
The nose informs subtly about slight oak and freshly cut green and yellow apples. The palate is apple-fresh and rounded with a pleasant midpalate weight. Hints of smoke and hazelnut glint happily here and there, making for a very appetizing Pinot Gris—a world apart from the popular Italian style.

Jammy oaky blueberry and cardamon aromas are proprietary for Mendoza Malbec.

This ripe, jammy wine is all about fruit. Its red berry flavors burst from the glass and are gently backed by tannins. It is already attractive, ripe and full. Drink from 2019.
Straightforward and appealing, this wine provides aromas and flavors of pineapple, peach and pear. The concentration isn't all there but the variety is unmistakable.

At nearly 10 years of age, this beautiful Gewürz shows how well a good California dessert wine can age. It's still brisk in clean acidity, but is honeyed and sweet, with nearly 19% residual sugar. Shows rich, exotic pineapple, tangerine marmalade, gingerbread, apricot jam, buttered toast, crème brûlée, vanilla cream and spice flavors, leading to a long, deliriously delicious finish. A heady, flamboyantly sweet wine to drink now.

A selection from the many parcels owned by the producer, this wine comes from the north slopes of the Montagne de Reims. It is a delicious, balanced wine that is 50-50 Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, rich and full in the mouth with perfumed acidity and a generous texture. The wine is ready to drink.

Harsh and hot, with sweet and sour flavors of oranges and mint.
Wine doesn't come much more buttery, luscious and creamy than this! It smells like melted butter and butterscotch, tastes rich, smooth and almost candylike, with a soft, gentle texture, apparently low acidity and lots of creamy viscosity.
Fresh and fruity, this is full of red cherry flavors and crisp acidity. It has some age, hinting at a more toasty future. For the moment, it's at its best after eight years aging on the lees in the bottle.

Naturalis Historia is a benchmark wine for Campania—and all of southern Italy—with spectacularly clean mineral tones on the heels of berry fruit, plums, leather and spice. The wine's approach is vertical and immediate but it also evolves slowly in the glass thanks to an ever-changing bouquet.
This is a strong, dry and tannic Cabernet Sauvignon, with intense blackberry, black currant and new oak flavors. Right now, it's immature, offering little beyond sheer power. Will it age? Six years is no problem. After that, the overripeness, in the form of raisins, may easily kick in.
An impressive ensemble from the newest generation of a winemaking family, this rich wine boasts great Amarone typicity and does so in a confident, determined manner. Almond, black cherry and ripe blueberry are backed by just enough acidity to appear taut and fresh. The wine conveys warmth and harmony over a long, dusty finish.
A mix of vineyards and AVAs go into this blended Syrah, which is co-fermented with 6% Viognier. The Viognier is definitely present, and the wine has a top end of grapefruit and citrus, adding scent, flavor and acid. It's full, forward, acidic and a little hot, and delivers plenty of flavor up front. What's not quite there is the layering of flavors that some of the other Walter Dacon Syrahs express.
Aromatic notes of tangerine and mandarin play on the nose, making for a heady opening. The concentrated palate shows juicy ripeness against tingling tart freshness. The finish is absolutely dry and totally refreshing. Drink now–2027.
Montepulciano Castronovo is a soft and layered wine with strata of black cherry, chocolate, spice and tobacco. The wine is loaded up with wood spice aromas followed by thick density on the close.
Pure varietal, just 13.5% alcohol, and priced in the low $20s—that would seem to be a recipe for a thin, wimpy red. Not here. Scents of bramble and baked bread, smoke and crushed rock, mingle with strawberry/cranberry fruit. The smoke has a wood fire penetration, but it works here, as the wine opens into a finish of caramel and buttered nuts.
Different in style from the equally good 2004, the 2005 Steading is a bigger, richer, warmer wine, with brandied cherry fruit flavors and a rather fat, almost oily mouthfeel. More fruit and feel, less earth and spice. Drink it up over the next few years.
A single parcel of 80-year old vines is the source of this foot trodden wine. It is rich and quite dense while having stylish black fruits and a ripe, smooth texture. The intense acidity keeps it fruity and juicy. It is still young and will be better from 2018.
87-89 Barrel sample. A big, generous wine, with intense black fruits but a bit too much oak. This could develop, but the balance is already missing.
This Riserva Amarone shows drying aromas of polished mineral, ash, smoke, dried fruit and black licorice. There's a touch of sweetness on the close followed by brown sugar and teriyaki sauce. Drink now.
Already accessible, this rich wine has fine tannins, ripe blackberry fruit and a dry core. Acidity and juicy fruitiness play well together, giving a solid, firm wine that could age well. Drink until 2018.
From one parcel of vines, this Chablis is warm, ripe, full of yellow fruits and the softest texture. It's very fruity with tangy lemon zest acidity and a light, crisp aftertaste. Drink now, but it will be better at the end of 2014. Screwcap.
Strong new wood and black fruit aromas suggest the power and character of this full, rich wine. From a single parcel, it has concentration, density and a wonderful mix of smooth wood-based flavors and more rugged fruits and tannins. Age this wine and don't drink before 2017.
This solid value wine would pair perfectly with pizza. An easy expression of Syrah, the wine is soft and silky, with simple, fruity layers of blueberry and cherry.
A blend of old-vine Cariñena (60%), Syrah (25%) and Merlot (15%). The color is impressively dark and so is the fruit—mainly plums and blackberries. Toast and dried spices from new oak give an additional impression of opulence. But even more impressive is the balance. This is no low-acid, fruit-and-oak wonder; the natural acidity of the Carignane shines through, giving lift and definition to the flavors. Easy to drink now, but should easily hold a few years.
The color of this vibrant Sicilian rosé (made with Nero d'Avola) is a deep pink raspberry and the wine's bouquet offers tones of cranberry, mature forest berry and blueberry skin. There's crisp spice in the mouth, but there's also a pungent sour note at the end.
Lemon blossoms and tangerines bring lift to the aromatics. On the palate there are flavors of tropical fruit and tart, green apples.
Denser, more tannic and fuller bodied than Lynmar's regular Pinot, which actually makes it less accessible. Showing notes of cherries and plums, as well as considerable oak. Tremendous spice in the finish. The richness, complexity and depth, not to mention tannins, suggest midterm aging. Hold until 2006.
This wine has notable attributes, but also some drawbacks. Initial aromas are tarry and rubbery, although these temper with air into something more resembling tree bark. The bulk of the flavors are dark notes of coffee, earth and prune, although a streak of tart berries stands out, becoming dominant on the tart, fresh finish.
Lees, peach and cream aromas are followed by dry stone-fruit flavors. It runs a little hot.
Alluring aromas of menthol, red berry, rose and herb lift out of the glass. The rounded solid palate offers raspberry, morello cherry, a touch of clove and a hint of cinnamon framed in firm tannins. It's straightforward by Barolo standards but it's appealing and already almost accessible. Drink after 2021.
There's a tawny edge to this wine, suggesting that it's quickly maturing and should be consumed soon. That said, it's drinking very well, with a slightly roasted, nutty character over soft strawberry/cherry fruit. Hints of pine needle and cured meat add further flavor interest.
Crushed raspberry, blue flower, tilled soil and graphite aromas lead the nose on this firmly structured wine.

It offers ripe black cherry, ground black pepper, licorice and grilled sage alongside tightly wound but fine tannins. Drink 2018–2026.
93-95 Barrel sample. All the elements are there, piling the sweetness, intense richness on layers of botrytis and finishing a crisp top of acidity. Impressive.
Concentrated structure and flint combine with richness in this wine. It shows spice, dense acidity, freshness and very green, crisp fruit flavors. There is a real line of structure running through the fruit, an edge of lemon zest. Keep 4–5 years. Screwcap.
Surprisingly, considering the importance of Guigal in the region, this is the first time the producer has made a Crozes-Hermitage. But they have certainly started with a fine bang, with this finely perfumed wine, bringing together ripe fruit, acidity and sweet, jelly flavors. There are even tannins to give it structure and concentration.
A blend of Tannat, Pinenc and Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a ripe, earthy wine. It has rich black fruits that show concentrated tannins while also promising a smoother ride in a few years.

Lime zest and freshly cut grass lend a particularly invigorating cool to this dry, delicate Riesling. It's brashly mineral on the palate, finishing tightly with a bracing shower of acidity.
Superrich in jammy raspberry, cherry and cola flavors, almost sweet, except it's technically dry. Shows firm acidity and even some dusty tannins, but the fruit is the alpha and omega, dominating everything. Drink now.
This is proof that excellent Chardonnay can come from this warm region in Southern California. Key lime pie, peach blossom and shaved apple aromas show on the nose. The palate sizzles with acidity and a savory hit of sea salt, with a core of Asian pear and stone fruit flavors.
Floral, young and jumpy smelling, with gumball aromas that leave you with the impression that the wine's clarity, balance and purity may be tenuous. The palate is raw but fresh, with simple but snappy wild berry flavors. Not a lot of structure or depth here.
Very toasty new oak overrides the fruit scents; in the mouth the flavors are light strawberry and rhubarb, with some surprising sweetness and a soft, approachable finish. Strikes this taster as too much oak for the light fruit.
Bright, fresh apple and lime notes are accented with an earthy, minerally complexity on this multifaceted Riesling. It's semi-dry in style with forward, juicy apple and nectarine flavors brightened with notes of lime zest and a distinctly herbaceous finish.

Not far behind Kilikanoon's R Reserve—and, indeed, it comes from the same vineyards—the 2004 Testament is also a tour de force. There's a hint of rhubarb and spicy cinnamon that lends intrigue to the aromas of rich blackberry fruit, while the flavors seamlessly blend in hints of red raspberries and cracked pepper. Finishes long, crisp and mouthwatering. Drink now–2020.
Well-toasted, with blackberry and raspberry backing up the oak on the nose. Tastes ripe and full, with plum and berry supported by big, almost thunderous tannins. Not a shy wine; offers a ton of grip and feel.
Dark, piercing, crusty black fruit aromas suggest burnt toast and lemon, and although there's a lemony bite to the palate, once it airs out chunky black fruit flavors take over. Not a thriller but it's pure and clean. Textbook mid-to-upper-level Malbec with some flair.
A likable, easy to drink wine, totally dry and brisk in acidity, with low alcohol. It has savory flavors of lemons, limes, oranges and spices.
Rustic and likeable, an easy wine to wash down burgers or simple Italian. Has loads of cherries, blueberries, boysenberries, loganberries and plums, with a dusting of clove and pepper. But for all that fruit, it's totally dry.
This wine is rich and expressive, with the grip and texture of a fine Chardonnay—but it's Pinot Gris. Roughly half was fermented in a concrete egg; the rest in stainless steel and one new acacia barrel. The fruit is fleshy but not fat, crisply defined with exceptional phenolic details of citrus skin. The underlying minerality further frames the ripe, tangy fruit, and the three-dimensional flavors expand and extend through a lingering finish.
Fresh Granny Smith apple and lemon notes are announced on the nose. On the palate they become fully fledged and weave their refreshing, uncompromisingly dry way across a slender dry body. This is very refreshing and totally invigorating: light yet full of flavor. The finish is long and dry.

Bold, ripe black-cherry and berry flavors pulsate from the core of this voluptuous Pinot Noir. It's a densely concentrated, full-bodied wine but neatly integrated, nuanced by subtle shades of spice, dark toast and bramble. Crisp cranberry acidity freshens the finish. Drink now through 2030.
The word massive barely begins to describe this Cabernet Sauvignon. It aims to compete with anything from Napa Valley, and does so largely successfully. The palate offers waves of ripe blackberries, black currants, dark chocolate and smoky oak flavors. What's harder to put into words is the elegance and balance. Despite its serious heft, the wine feels comfortable in the mouth. Indisputably an ager, it should begin to mellow after 2018, and continue to offer pleasure for many years.
A fabulous bottling from one of West Paso's most beautiful vineyards, this blend of 54% Grenache, 22% Mourvèdre, 18% Syrah and 6% Tannat shows aromas of fresh black cherry, dried mint and fudge on the well-integrated nose. Black plum, soy, pencil lead, condensed teriyaki, lilac and violet flavors unfold on the delicious palate.

Waxy citrus skins and pressed apple notes are accented by a whiff of pine in this racy light-footed Riesling. It's just a shade off dry, with an invigoratingly brisk texture. Drink now through 2019.
Pure Cabernet Sauvignon from older vines, the Cold Creek bottling often begins life rather compact, even hard, and will usually benefit from some years of bottle age. This 2005 is a tough, somewhat stemmy wine, with tightly wound black fruits, herbs and leather wrapped into its core. Tannic and unyielding, even after some hours of breathing time, it is a bit too soon to know exactly how good it will ultimately become.
A bit sharp, with the acidity giving a cutting mouthfeel to the cherry, cola, orange zest, anise and smoky sandalwood flavors. Yet it's nice and dry and silky, and two or three years in the bottle could provide resolution.
This opens with aromas of wood shop, toast, blue flower and spearmint. The lean palate offers toasted oak, dried blackberry and a whiff of clove alongside angular, astringent tannins that dry out the finish. It lacks the fruit richness to stand up to the oak.
This wine combines 42% Merlot with 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, 23% Malbec and 5% Cabernet Franc. It is inviting in juicy red berry and currant, with accents of lavender and herb. Full figured, it offers additionally compelling layers of subtle spice before a focused finish.

This firm and tannic wine shows the structure of the Malbec grape. It is also fruity with red currant and black plum-skin flavors that are supported by intense acidity. The wine, with its dry texture should be aged, so drink from 2016.
A sure-fire crowd-pleaser, this tightly-wound Merlot comes on very Cab-like, but with red fruits more than blue or black. It opens up into a broad mid-palate, showing well-balanced nuances of olive and earth, fresh herb, pepper and licorice. Dense, textural and smoky, it's delicious now or could be cellared for another five or six years.
One of the best Santa Carolina wines in years. The nose is big and floral, with tons of plum and berry. The mouth is packed tight and tastes great, with ripe cassis and a lot of chocolate to back things up.

Merlot hardly gets richer than this. Just explodes in the mouth with flavors of black cherry, blackberry and chocolate truffle flavors. As sweet as it seems, it's actually dry, with a wonderful edge of acidity. Drink now.

Honey, peach and pear aromas open the nose on this fresh Vermentino. A touch of vanilla cream gives the finish a full, generous feel.
This four-grape, Bordeaux-style blend offers firm, concentrated plum and cassis fruit, stiff tannins and a touch of iron and graphite. It saw 45% new French oak—pretty impressive for a $25 red.
The reserve Merlot draws grapes from both the Seven Hills and the DuBrul vineyards, both excellent. It is forward and ripe, with pomegranate, cherry, berry and plum fruit showing, plenty of acid, and fairly lightweight tannins. Somewhat oddly for a reserve, it seems more appropriate for near-term drinking rather than cellaring.
Fleshy and borderline mealy on the nose, with banana and melon as the primary aromas, this feels heavy even though firm acidity creates spine and depth. It tastes like a mash-up of apple, melon and baking spice before the chunky finish.
Gritty aromas of road tar share space on the nose with black cherry and dark plum scents. This feels hard and abrasive, even by Ribera del Duero standards. Plum, berry and integrated oak flavors finish savory and with a lasting note of dry oak. Drink through 2023.
This Champagne is produced from a small parcel of Chardonnay in the heart of the city of Reims above the Lanson cellars. It has more than rarity value with its wonderful mature flavors, richness and flavors of vanilla, baked apple and hints of the wood in which the wine fermented. It is ready to drink now.

Hints of dark chocolate and coconut shavings round out the intrigue and complexity. The wine is ready to enjoy now, but worth cellaring through 2020.
Cooked-down blackberries take on pink peppercorn and new leather aromas in this Malbec hailing from the high-altitude vineyards of Colorado. The dark berry tones of the palate carry shards of graphite, with zippy red currant acidity keeping the full body and grainy tannins in check. It's a bit tight right now and should open up after 2016.
This is a light-bodied wine with pretty cherry and herb flavors. It's totally dry, but has some rugged tannins. Best with a juicy steak or lamb.
This Cabernet Franc is superripe and oaky, with earthy, stewed and woody aromas. In the mouth, this feels grippy, resiny and dense. As it airs out, vanilla, woodspice, prune and cassis aromas come to the fore. The chocolate-tinged finish is slightly sticky in feel, exuding a strong sense of ripeness.
Hints of honey and orange spice sweeten the notes of candle wax and lanolin on this intense, tangerine-inflected Riesling. It's dry and full bodied in style, with a languorous heft of honey and flower flavors that meld on the palate. Tangy lime acidity adds zip and balance.
The Flying Pig is a blend of 60% Cabernet Franc and 40% Merlot.

Perfect for ribs in a sweet barbecue sauce.
Perfumed and deliciously aromatic, this is full of bright fruitiness, with a lemon zest tang and lively acidity. Great as an apéritif, it's ready to drink now.
The deep gold color of this relatively young wine suggests that oxidation is setting in. But wait! This wine explodes into full glory 24 hours after first being opened.

It turns into a breathtaking, spätlese-style effort on the palate, with honey, Meyer lemon and ripe grapefruit flavors.

Ultrarich and fruity, this Cabernet shows the grapey ripeness Paso Robles is famous for. The wine is fresh and jammy in blackberries, cherries and raspberries. It's a little one-dimensional, and the alcohol is very high, but not hot. Drink now.
91-93 Barrel sample. Structured and juicy at the same time, this is a fragrantly fruity wine. It is rich, but with intense freshness as well. The final taste brings in a more firm, dark texture.
Here's a no fuss wine for everyday dinners with loads of fresh fruit, kiwi, pineapple and a strong emphasis on floral fragrances. The flavors focus on dried fruit, sun-dried apple chips in particular.
An easy, fairly complex Pinot Noir for drinking over the next year or two. Dry and crisp, it has earthy flavors of cherries, cola, bacon and spices. With modest alcohol levels, it has a silky texture.

Aromas of freshly cut flowers, green apple, lime and white peach leap from the glass. The creamy texture is brightened by lively acidity. It's simple but well executed.
From the foothills of the Alps to the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, this northern Italian transplant is ripe for the drinking. Mocha java coffee, raspberry and strawberry round out the aromas and flavors, while grippy tannins offer support.
A distinctly Burgundian-style effort, with aromas of buttered and toasted hazelnuts backed by spiced pears. Very toasty and rich, but boasts enough citrusy acidity (despite 100% malolactic fermentation) to carry it off. A five-vineyard blend from an area just outside of Auckland. World class.
Aromas of perfumed wood, with the wood tannins persisting on the palate. The wine needs to lose its wood dominance to allow the fruit to come through. There is enough rich black currant flavor for this to happen in the next 2–3 years.
A well-behaved Chard with a streak of minerality that uplifts the apple and peach flavors, as well as lees and oak. Finishes a bit rough and earthy, with tobacco leaf acidity.

Santa Duc's small parcel of Châteauneuf-du-Pape is planted to a mix of 95% Grenache and 5% Mourvèdre. It's a peppery, briary wine that's savory and spicy, with blackberry fruit providing support rather than leading. The tannins are soft, but still provide ample structure for aging through 2020.
Still a good color. Pepper, earth, blackberry, roasted coffee aromas. Still some sturdy tannins to shed. Tight now, with blackberry and cherry flavors, but closed, austere. Could re-emerge from its cocoon. Drink now-2010.
This Cabernet is a bit on the green side, with sharp, slightly bitter tannins that are not completely masked by the overlay of chocolatey barrel flavors.
This Barbera has a subtle fragrance of plum and spice. The palate offers restrained black cherry flavors, along with hints of white pepper and nutmeg. Simple, but well made, this would pair perfectly with pasta Bolognese or mushroom dishes.

Sweet and open on the nose, with blackberry and pure grape aromas. The palate has a tight, drawing texture but rewarding flavors of spice and roasted berry fruit. Long and flavorful on the finish, with bite and tannic residue. A wine with positive components but a rough young feel.
This is a tremendous wine, and a hugely enjoyable one from the point of view of power and authority combined with balance. It just detonates on the palate with the deepest flavors of currants and black pepper, yet the huge structure of the tannins, and extreme dryness, make it elegant. Andthere's no trace of heat. Should age gracefully for many years.
The curse of Chanson's high toast for whites hits this wine. It is a shame, because once through the wood, the fruit is fresh and rounded, crispened but also given ripe white pear flavors.
Intensely ripe black-cherry aromas are matched with a fresh and juicy and yet remarkably elegant palate. Delicate tannins and a lean, granitic edge frame the lingering finish. It's a brisk, balanced wine to enjoy now through 2018.
An elegant wine with sculpted berry fruit flavors, this is compact and persistent. A touch of citrus accompanies generous allspice and baking-spice highlights. The lengthy finish brings hints of sandalwood and caramel.
An attractive, lightly structured cru wine that has juicy cherry fruits. It is balanced, ripe with acidity and gentle tannins in equal measure. Drink from late 2017.
A blend of 70% Sangiovese, 15% Sagrantino and 15% Merlot, this opens with aromas of blue flower, plum cake, raisin, mocha and a whiff of resin. The dense palate offers blackberry, plum, vanilla, roasted coffee bean and sage alongside tightly compacted tannins that need to unwind.
This is an easy, tasty bubbly, with raspberry, orange and vanilla flavors. Blended from French Columbard, Chardonnay, Sangiovese and Gamay, it's crisp in acidity, with a sweet finish.
The winery's style is a leaner, more minerally and elegant Chardonnay, rather than the blowsy, ripe kind so popular these days. This '09 is quite fine, with brisk acidity and a steely tang to the orange and apricot flavors. Drink over the next three years with shellfish in cream and butter sauces.
Blackberries and some spicy wood in the form of cedar make for an inviting nose. More blackberry flavors, with additions of cocoa on the layered, enticing palate. It strikes the right balance of weight and tang. It's a refreshing wine with the legs to run the race.

Light in body, with savory acidity, this Pinot offers plush flavors of raspberry tart, red cherry pie filling, root beer, mocha and cinnamon spice. It's more elegant than complex. Drink now.
If anyone can perfectly evoke the ripe style of California Cabernet along with the structure of Washington state fruit, it's Peter Rosback of Sineann – conveniently located in Oregon. Why this iconoclastic winemaker does not just move to Washington is hard to figure; he obviously loves the grapes and knows exactly what to do with them. This Cabernet Sauvignon, from a relatively young block at the Champoux vineyard, has some heat and chewy tannins. But it should age well, and the tightly wound herb and tobacco and stone flavors that are now constrained will ultimately come out.
Made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot, this is a good, smooth wine that shows its Napa origins in the ripeness of fruit and classy tannins. Floods the mouth with blackberries and oak. There's a certain sharpness that cuts through the richness and lasts through the finish, which may limit ageability, so drink soon.
The estate-grown fruit has been deftly handled, retaining its blackberry, blueberry and black cherry core, with a layer of smoky tannins underneath. This is blended with 15% Merlot, which seems to broaden the midpalate and add a hint of red fruits as well. The finish is thick and substantial, and the wine keeps its focus all the way through.
At the age of more than eight years, this 100% Cabernet remains powerful with blackberry, cherry and oak flavors. It's just starting to show bottle complexity, with the tannins softening and the fruit gaining earthy tones. A criticism is the alcohol, which is high and doesn't seem to lose its heat. Drink now.
Freshly picked blackberries that got ripe under the hot summer sun. Lots of ground black peppercorn dust. Black currant liqueur, black licorice and even a smattering of pancetta. These are the flavors of this delicious, complex Petite Sirah. It shows the big, firm tannins the variety is famous for, but they're exceptionally ripe and fine. Absolutely first-class, one of the best Petite Sirahs of the vintage, and it's not surprising that it comes from Napa Valley.
Aromas of oak, toast, coconut and dark berry lead the nose and carry over to the bracing palate along with white pepper and oak-driven spice. Firm, extremely astringent tannins give this a bracing finish. Drink after 2018.
This is a cherry candy-flavored, somewhat chunky/blocky style of Syrah. It's forward and fresh, but does not show exceptional structure or complexity.
It may be that this wine needs time in the cellar, but right now, it's tough and tannic. There are some fine blackberry, cassis, spicy plum and cedar flavors, and it could blossom after 2008 for a few years.
Be warned: This is a very tannic wine. It's so dry and astringent, it makes your mouth pucker, which begs to the question, will it age? The answer is a provisional yes. It's balanced and feels good and rich, and if you chew, there's a lot of blackberry fruit. Best to hold until 2008.
Aromas of cured ham and funky, gaseous notes are heavy. Lime, mango and melon flavors persist on a chunky, slick feeling finish. This is good but oily and strange on the nose.
This Cab opens with mellow, woody aromas on top of cassis and berry scents. The palate is a bit choppy and drying, but there's good structure to it along with attractive flavors of moss, earth, baked berry and light herbs.
The fleshy, generous blueberry and cherry fruit is made more vivid by white pepper notes. The palate is soft and rounded and full of easy-drinking joy. This is ready, bright and refreshing. Drink soon.
Nectarine, peach pit and a dusty, oily scent define the nose on this mid-level, quaffable white. The body is on the plump side, with ample acidity. Flavors of stone fruits and papaya finish briny.
Lemberger was planted here in the 1970s, and Kiona still carries the torch for the grape. Earthy, gamy, soft and smooth, it has a quickly maturing flavor set, built upon chocolate and cherries, with dusty tannins.
Baked plum, underbrush, toast and whiffs of exotic spice come together on this blend of 65% Corvina and 35% Cabernet Sauvignon. The full-bodied palate offers ripe black cherry, redcurrant, cocoa and anise alongside firm, fine-grained tannins.
Mild aromas of tar, baking spice and charred meat lead onto the tannin-driven, muscular palate. It finishes with plenty of grip, which seems to clip some of the flavors.
This wine is principally Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, with the balance other Bordeaux varieties. Aromas of clove, sweet plum, vanilla and tire rubber lead to sweet, palate-coating blueberry and smoke flavors that linger.
Well made in a light, easy style, this wine has classic aromas like dried cherry and cinnamon, and dry, appetizing flavors like sour cherry and rhubarb. It will make a great house wine at this reasonable price.
Fresh strawberries and light cream lead the way on the nose, while the medium acidity provides a good lift to the juicy cherry fruit flavors. Clean and enjoyable.
A bit obviously pungent and sweaty, this passion fruit-scented wine is direct and to the point, marrying medium body with a tangy, mouthwatering finish. If you enjoy slightly feral citrus notes, you may rate it higher.
This is appropriately austere for a young Eden Valley Riesling, offering crisp green apple and lime sensations backed by subtle grace notes of wet stone. The finish is long, mouthwatering and almost painfully tart, suggesting it will fare well in the cellar for up to 10 years.
Crushed oregano, rosemary oil and yard clippings show on the nose of this pyrazine-popping bottling. Flavors of cut grass and jalapeño on the palate grow complex thanks to a green orange-peel element.
This wine is rich and rounded, with plenty of spice, ripe berry fruits and acidity to balance. As it develops, the wine will fill out and give satisfying richness. Drink from 2019.
This Syrah shows ripe blackberry, mulberry and currant flavors, plus notes of smoked meat, charred bone, anise and black pepper. With firm tannins and fine minerality, this clonal Syrah has great structure. It's terrific to drink now after some time in a decanter, and it can also age for 6–8 more years.
Crisp and distinctive, with a strong mineral streak, this full-flavored Pinot Blanc has a range of fruit flavors, centered upon apple and pear, but also touching on blood orange and a suggestion of celery as well. Low in alcohol, but high in flavor.
Although this Cab is quite tannic, it's really good now. Shows impeccable balance in a New World style that oozes black and red currants, dark chocolate, licorice, cedar and plums, with a note of raw, bloody meat. Very high quality, an excellent rendition of western Paso Robles hillside Cabernet. Good through 2015, with proper cellaring.
The main taste impression of this superripe Cabernet is of chocolate-covered raisins. Then the even riper notes of prunes emerge. The alcohol, which is 15.7% by volume, gives the finish a glyceriney sweetness. It will satisfy die-hard fans of this Napa style, but it's hard to see this clumsy wine developing in the bottle before the fruit crashes.
Aromas of toast, oak, coconut, vanilla, mocha and mature plum lead the nose. Oak-driven sensations drive the robust palate along with ripe berry and a confectionary note. Scorching alcohol dominates the finish and throws this off-balance while bracing tannins leave an astringent close.
A nicely made Cab-Merlot blend with earthy, dark plum, spicy cinnamon and clove and a touch of menthol herby-ness, especially on the finish. The mellow texture on this wine will see that it pairs nicely with a range of fall and wintertime foods.
Fleshy peach, melon and pineapple aromas on the nose. Feels lifted and fresh, and decidedly not oaky, with citrusy orange and nectarine flavors. Fruity, round and easy on the finish.
A taut, tight wine, packed with wood and rich fruit flavors but still developing. When it matures in a year, this top wine from Rauzan Despagne will have enormous, intense fruit. This is a great white wine, one that shows how good white from the Entre-deux-Mers can be.
This is a fine ripe wine. Ripe tannins and attractive red-berry fruits are right up front. A firm dry core suggests it will age although this wine is up for drinking now with its fine balance between acidity, structure and fruit.
A Chateauneuf-style, ruby red blend of 52% Syrah 26% Mourvèdre and 22% Grenache. Lots of spice and black pepper to complement the bright red fruits. Still very young and not-quite resolved; the aromatics have a fresh cut lumber smell, though very little new oak was actually used in the wine. Give it some time to knit together, or decant well before drinking.
Made from organically grown grapes, this impressive sparkler is made with no sugar or liqueur added. It has an expressive fragrance of white flowers and stone fruit, while the palate offers apple, citrus and roasted almond notes along with hints of spice. It's a perfect apéritif but will also pair beauitfully with shellfish.
A light and fruity wine that's been spoiled by a touch of sulfur. Aside from that bitter edge, the wine shows attractive apple and citrus flavors.
Strong elements of black pepper and smoky oak beg for steak to be paired with this 100% varietal wine. It showcases sizable weight and a solid tannic structure, with supple expressions of black cherry and chocolate that linger long on the rich finish. This bold beauty should hold well through 2023.
Big-hearted and round, this is a full wine, with apple pie and cream flavors leading to a crisp, mineral aftertaste. It's delicious, very drinkable now, packed with ripe but refreshing fruit.
With fine tannins, ripe berry fruits and a good cut of acidity, this is an attractive wine that deserves some aging. It has weight along with its strawberry and red currant flavors. Drink from 2016. Made by UNIVITIS Producers.
This is a well-structured juicy, fruity wine. Aromas of redcurrants, and flavors of fresh black fruits, are balanced by firm, dry tannins and some acidity.

A creamy hint of white chocolate adds fullness to the soft currant, cranberry and strawberry hull flavors. The palate is mouthfilling and round with a good citrus lift to the fresh close.
Aromas of bath soap, air freshener and vegetal fruits lead to a tangy, linear palate with green flavors mixed with citrus and melon. This basic Chard holds onto those green-ish characteristics on the finish.
This tight crisp wine delivers citrus and sliced apple fruits. There is a brisk mousse that gives the wine quite a bite of acidity. All the elements point in the direction of food for this Champagne. Like many bone-dry Champagnes, this bottling needs to age, so drink from 2018.
A thin, uninspiring wine with citrus and apple sauce flavors and lots of acidity. Tastes watered down, but will do in a pinch.
Parcels of old vines produce this complex wine. It has dark black berry fruits while still retaining freshness over the bone-dry tannins. There is a depth to the structure, pushing the wine but not going over the top. Age for 2–3 years.

Some of the region's oldest Dijon clone plantings are in this wine, done in a firm, classy style with little new wood apparent.

A rounded style of wine, its texture full of warm fruits, pear, apricot and some lime juice to give a fresh edge. It is full of flavor, with apples and cream flavors, layered with crisp, tight acidity, but all within the context of a full, dense wine. Glass stopper.
Gorgeous peach and apricot flavors give this round wine great richness, an almost tropical fruit character. But it never loses sight of its terroir, a steely edge coming through, with vibrant acidity and a final spice and berry fruit finish. Age for 4–5 years. Imported by Blue Danube Wine Co.
A savory, tannic and slightly earthy Cabernet Sauvignon made by winemakers Denis and May-Britt Malbec, who consult on many Napa Valley-based projects. The 2007 and 2009 are more indicative of how silky smooth and refined their Cabernets can be, with this one exhibiting just slightly too much tobacco and smoke on the finish, overpowering the berry fruit.
The celebrated Poggio alle Mura Brunello delivers hearty masculine richness and deep layers of sassy spice that are offset by plush blackberry and cherry nuances. The wine shows solid structure that will soften with careful cellar aging.

Orange and apricot aromas are backed by big, baked flavors of lemon and melon. Starts faster than it finishes; sluggish and heavy on the finish.
Light and fruity, this is dominated by a creamed apple flavor that is open and round. There is an attractive lemon zest touch at the end of this simple, ready-to-drink wine.
Soft and fruity, this young wine is full of red fruits and attractive acidity. It has a core of tannins that will soften over the next few months. Drink from 2018.

The finish is big and expansive, an indication that the wine should age nicely for at least four or five years. A good wine for fans of Chile's reds.
Opulent white blossom and tropical fruit flavors abound in this superripe, concentrated Riesling. Dry in style, it's plump and round in mouthfeel, yet reined in by bristling lime acidity and a rippling vein of minerality. It's a powerful, composed and complex wine.
With a heady bouquet of berry and peppery spice, new Edmeades winemaker Ben Salazar is showing great talent with Mendocino Zinfandel, producing a fairly large-scale bottling full of intense spice and soft tannins.

Ripe blackberry, blueberry, violet and cooking spice aromas all come together on this blend of Sangiovese and a small amount of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. The palate offers up juicy black cherry, plum steeped in spirits, white pepper and clove while firm, chewy tannins hold it all together. Drink through 2018.
An almost tropical touch of pineapple and passion fruit hovers over the glass. This is testament to the ripe 2015 vintage. The palate, however, reins in this fruity generosity with fresh, zesty notes of citrus, adding also a counterweight of textured phenolics. There is structure despite all the ripeness and ample refreshment, almost some grippiness. The zesty finish is very moreish.
This rich, full wine shows a strongly mineral character as well as ripe green-plum and citrus flavors. It has concentration, spice as well as fresh final acidity. The name of the wine comes from the Roman name for the producer's village, Sury-en-Vaux. It will be better if aged for a few months, so drink from early 2017.
Lavish yet not overdone aromas of vanilla, plumeria, dried banana and yellow peach arise from the glass in this blend of 45% Viognier, 45% Marsanne and 10% Roussanne. There is a honeyed character to the palate, along with banana, mango and buttered guava bread, proving quite tropical yet very welcoming.
The little brother at Quinta de la Rosa is getting bigger, with its well-crafted fruits, layers of firm spice, sweet tannins and final firm structure. A reflection of the vintage, this is particularly warm and rich, for drinking now.
A very distinctive 100% Cab that some might even find controversial. It's ripe almost to the point of supermaturity, showing powerful currant and licorice flavors that are very well oaked. Finishes hard in tannins in its youth. Aims, with some success, at an extracted, modern or cult style.
It is the 30% Alicante Bouschet in the blend that gives the dense color to this ripe wine. Concentrate and rich, the generous berry flavors are balanced by a more restrained acidity and smoky flavors. The wine is ready to drink.
After a tough 2002 vintage, Delas has bounced back nicely with this wine, which shows uncommon depth and intensity for a humble Côtes du Ventoux. Bold scents of black cherries, blackberries and earth rise from the glass and there's plenty of richness on the palate, even some slightly rustic tannins to help rein in all that fruit. Notes of licorice, tar and earth on the finish make it more than a simple fruit bomb.
Very crisp fruit, with light acidity and a taut character. A lively wine, bright and vivacious, packed with citrus. Screwcap.

This Extra Dry Prosecco opens with frothy cream and floral tones of jasmine and honeysuckle. It tastes lively and fresh in the mouth thanks to its well-integrated acidity and its piquant effervescence.
Here's an unusual mix of Syrah and Carignan that runs lean and racy. The nose offers more spice and leather than ripeness, while the palate is downright tangy and teetering on sharp. Freshness and power are not issues; but it might be too tangy and citrusy for anyone expecting a beefy, extracted wine.
There's loads of personality here. Verduzzo does beat to its own drum with unique aromas of pine cone, chopped peppermint, candied fruit and loads of floral lavender honey.

Thick aromas of cocoa and leather are accented by bright cherries. Rich and full-flavored without being heavy, the wine's strong coffee flavors are counterbalanced by a beam of cherry fruit that persists through the finish. Ready to drink now.
Vaio Armaron is an elegant and sophisticated wine that exhibits deep complexity and aromatic intensity. Thanks to its pretty layers of red cherry, spice and cola this wine exemplifies the best of classic Amarone tradition. It makes a fabulous winter wine to be paired with beef stew or roasts.
Stalky aromas give off the impression of corn and funk. It feels ultrasnappy, with medicinal fruit, forced oak and berry flavors that don't really click. The finish is grating and slightly bitter.
Primitivo makes up three-fifths of the blend, Petite Sirah most of the rest. It's consistent with past vintages: dark, soft, and plummy. But in 2005 there was something special going on, and the decadently sweet black cherry fruit really sings here.
Porpora Riserva is a plump, chewy wine with loads of blueberry jam and blackberry backed by Christmas spice and toasted almond. The wine is dense and rich with a smooth, velvety close.
Despite its classification as a rich Smaragd, this is more about freshness. The ripe fruit is dominated by pears, white currants and lively acidity. This is an open wine, ripe and generous.
As a fan of almost everything O. Fournier puts in the bottle, I'd say this value-oriented wine needs work. For starters, it mixes Zinfandel-like blueberry fruit with green, weedy aromas. The palate holds onto that green essence while also tossing out rhubarb, tea and carob flavors. Lacks the ripeness and structure as it should have, even at this modest price.
Bone dry and earthy, this Cab shows modest flavors of blackberries, currants and mocha. It's a clean, affordable wine that's good for an everyday red.

This is the inaugural release from this winery, which dedicates itself to the production of Grenache. A blend of fruit from Alder Ridge and Upland vineyards, it brings aromas of red plum, herb and spice that are followed by elegant, mouthwatering red-fruit flavors. It shows the variety's more delicate side.
Shows the power and finesse of this great vineyard. The cherry, persimmon, cola and baking spice flavors have the exotically feral notes of chamomile, game and mushrooms so typical of this vineyard and the Fort Ross area. So beautiful and deft now, it's hard not to pop the cork, but this Pinot will age well for at least 10 years.
Light yellow in tint, with big tropical aromas centering on melon. Tastes more lemony and dry than the nose might suggest, with a strong, astringent blast of green apple on the finish.
With generic berry, cherry and chocolate flavors that are rich and ripe, this soft, simple red blend is O.K. for everyday drinking.
Grillo Parlante (“talking cricket”) is a pure expression of Grillo with slightly oxidized aromas of butterscotch and caramel. Fresh fruit comes through as melon, apricot and candied lemon.
Bright, fresh strawberries combine with a hint of green herbs for an attractive nose. But the flavors of this 50-50 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot are less effusive. Still, it finishes lemony and tart, making it a fine summer sipper.

This country-style wine has bright citrus-accented fruit and buttery spice aromas, and drinks pleasant and dry. On the finish, it turns citrusy again.
Lots to admire here, and not just the price. This is a dry, smooth wine, with good varietal character. The apple and peach flavors are lightly oaked. Best Buy

From the Castellani group, this plump Sangiovese is not a shy or subdued wine. In fact, it delivers a steady stream of mature cherry, blackberry, oak, clove, spice and dark chocolate. There's a touch of sour bitterness on the finish as well.

This limited-production gem (90 cases imported) speaks distinctly of the northern Rhône and the Syrah grape. It starts off with cracked pepper, anise and a hint of hickory smoke, then delivers cassis, hickory and licorice flavors. It's full-bodied while retaining an elegant structure and finishes long, buffered by soft tannins. Drink now–2020.
Feels rough in the mouth, because the bubbles are big and scoury, not small and fine. But the wine is nicely dry and very clean, with pleasant orange and lime flavors.
Baked blackberries meet with caramel, vanilla, forest floor and a tart plum skin touch on the nose of this bottling by the Paso Robles-based Tooth & Nail team. It's smooth and soft on the sip, with black currant, elderberry, pepper dust, charcoal and rosemary flavors. It's ripe but with a very dry edge.
A big success, this a wine that manages to combine the ripeness of Merlot fruit from 2005 with impressive tannins and power and still have structure and acidity. This should age well over 10 years.
Leafy and herbal on the nose, with complementary flavors of crushed tomato leaf, melon and fig. Despite the green notes, it shows reasonably high alcohol and ample weight on the palate, finishing long. Drink now.
This Rioja reserva hits all the standard checkpoints with aplomb. Earthy loamy mossy aromas of plum and berry fruits feature a hint of tobacco and vanilla.

Sweet with 30 g/L of residual sugar, Sorelle's Muscat Canelli is light on its feet, and easy to enjoy in a picnic setting or leisurely coast through the California Delta through Lodi. At only 12.2 percent alcohol, it'll make you happy without a headache.
Pears and pineapples turn buttery and oaky in the mouth without being overdone. A lush, easy-drinking wine that's fairly soft and designed for immediate gratification, unlike some of Grove Mill's other offerings.

This is a fun, complex wine, a blend of 79% Sauvignon Blanc, 18% Muscat Canelli and 3% Viognier, all mountain-grown. Orange blossom and jasmine permeate the inviting entry before waves of creamy tangerine and peach play on the palate, lifted by lively acidity.
Ripe and lusty, this is earthy and foresty on the nose, with plenty of oak, olive, eucalyptus and graphite. The palate is saturated almost to the point of being too heavy, but that only means that lush, penetrating, herbal blackberry and cola flavors have a stout base to work with. A toasted finish with some bitterness closes this out. Drink through 2019.
The wine is soft, a gentle meander through the flavors of Sauvignon Blanc without any shocks. It has an attractive, rounded texture, with shots of acidity that complement the apple skin and pear flavors. Drink now.
A pleasant surprise, this budget-priced Viognier shows plenty of plump fruit without getting overly big or blowsy. Citrus and pineapple flavors reflect the moderate alcohol levels, finishing on a juicy, succulent note. Drink now.

The result is a very expressive, gently but deeply fruited, slender palate that will sing with spicy Asian dishes or soft cheeses. It offers wonderfully lasting flavor.
Surprisingly subtle, yet maddeningly complex, this is a rare treat to unravel slowly, sip by sip. Sweet and honeyed on the nose with scents of freesia, orange peel and stone fruit, but accented with just a hint of sun-dried hay. The palate is deeply concentrated with undulating waves of honey, beeswax and fruit, but balanced with striking tangerine acidity. Remarkably long on the finish.

Craig's Howell Mountain Cab is far more tannic than its Mount Veeder version. It's shut down, but has an enormous heart of blackberry fruit that should emerge in time; classically structured. Start drinking it in 2008.
Full to the tipping point, with sweet aromas of pears and peaches. Is it over done? Maybe a little, but in between the folds of very ripe fruit there's some mineral and citrus pith. Bottom line: the funky blue bottle catches your eye and the wine is fine. But the 2005 cost $15 and this one is going for $28. Can somebody please explain the drastic price hike?
Opens with a mix of toast and dusty, herbal aromas, and with time it turns more saucy than precisely fruity. A bulky wine with a chunky mouthfeel and fleshy flavors of herbal plum. A late wave of tartness and more herbal flavors cements things into place.
This is a good price for a Cab that's dry, balanced and elegant. It's obviously not a blockbuster, but the way the cherry, and blackberry flavors interact with oak and dried herbs makes the wine charming and even complex.

Bright and zesty on the nose, this wine boasts an aromatic emphasis of passion fruit and citrus. The palate shows tension, with ringing acidity, while lime, green mango, grapefruit and passion fruit flavors finish fresh and racy.

Medium weight with a lifting acidic cut to the close.
Melon and peach aromas are fresh and come with a touch of vanilla. This is a well-made, solid Chardonnay with good body and fresh acidity. Flavors of apple, melon and spice finish with a touch of oaky cinnamon and a somewhat waxy texture.
Strong scents of cola and chocolate come up quickly from the glass, and those flavors notes override the light strawberry and cherry fruit. With a bit of breathing time they all combine gracefully, crafting a full forward wine with a pleasing creamy texture.
Certainly richer and more balanced in every way than this winery's regular '99 Cabernet. It has well-ripened blackberry and spicy plum flavors that are generously oaked, and is dry.
At nearly 80% Grenache, this is a full-bodied, creamy-textured rendering of the Barossa's classic red trio. Savory, peppery elements add welcome complexity to the nose, while the flavors fold in hints of molasses and plum, then end on a long, supple note. Drink now–2017.

Although labeled Shiraz, this wine also includes 10% Petit Verdot and 5% Viognier. Those additions help account for its impressive color and rich mouthfeel. Vanilla and cedar frame mixed berries, yet the wine remains savory and complex, adding hints of black olive, mocha and grilled meat. Drink this dense, full-bodied wine now through 2025.
The Tadpole Shiraz is Gemtree's entry-level offering, but it's still a fine effort, with predominantly plummy flavors, but enough of a savory edge to keep it from being simply jammy. Tannins are creamy-soft, making for immediate accessibility. Drink now.
Fresh acidity and a dry style make this a great food rosé. It has crisp red berry and currant fruits,  vibrant acidity and a lively aftertaste.

This red is roughly split between Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon. It spent time in 40% new French oak and shows density and grip. There are substantial acids, bright black fruits and a streak of black tea among the flavors.
A moderately aromatic wine with notes of green herb, citrus and cherry. It's medium bodied with chalky tannins and abundant mocha flavors with the concentration seeming a bit lacking.
Lime and orange peel remain in front of dried apricot and nuts on the nose. The palate shows soft grassiness and lifted acidity, which keeps the feel lean and short.
94-96. Barrel sample. Showing a judicious blend of new wood and ripe fruit, this is a wine that has a creamed-apple texture. It's full of bright grapefruit, sweet apple and green plum flavors.
Sure, it's an oaky Chardonnay, but it's an uncommonly well-executed version at a reasonable price. Scents of toast, cinnamon and citrus custard give way to flavors of oranges, stone fruit and toasted grain. It's richly textured and lush in the mouth, showing just a hint of warmth on the finish.
Straight down-the-middle aromas of red cherry, salt and pepper, vanilla and a touch of brioche show on this bottling of a clone that's related to the Brunello region. It's lighter bodied on the palate and quite easy to quaff, with light cherry and strawberry flavors riding a gravelly texture.
In the prestigious village of Vosne-Romanée, there is little room for anything but Grand and Premier Cru vineyards. This wine, from the flatter ground at the bottom of the slope, shows something of the structure that makes the great wines. To balance that it also has bright fruit and plenty of acidity. It will be ready to drink from early 2018.

This creamy blend of Ribolla Gialla and Friulano opens with bright aromas of butterscotch, honey and caramel. Brushstrokes of apricot and Golden Delicious apple fill in the background.

Floral and wet-stone aromas are followed by tangy kiwi and jicama flavors keeping to a nicely dry profile. This distinctive wine from extremely consistent Saracina has bracing acidity and good concentration but remains on the subtle side.
Chunky and a bit hard-edged, this Shiraz combines plum and vanilla notes with hints of cocoa and black olive. There's some richenss here, it just needs a few years to emerge. Try 2012-2017.
One of the best Pinot Blancs of this or any vintage. It was mostly fermented in stainless steel, with about one-fifth in new French oak. Just beautiful, with the creamy lushness of a fine Chardonnay. The fruit flavor is all about ripe, zesty citrus, spicy pears, tangerines and tangy green apples.

Quite big and decadent smelling as notes of caramel-drizzled apple pie with vanilla ice cream on top emanate from the glass. The mouth is full and milky with solid acidity supporting the rich flavors of toasted brioche and smoky apple. A solid choice for dishes that can match its intensity of flavors: think lobster newburg or crab thermidor.

A blend of Napa Valley, Lake County and Lodi, this is a somewhat rustic wine, with a minty green, briary edge to the cherry fruit. It's astringently tannic, but appeals for its dry balance.

It's supported with enough acidity to keep it focused, and the flavors wrap into a finish that is a combination of every crème brûlée you've ever enjoyed.
Ripe and soft, perfumed and floral, this is pure fruit, a pear- and peach-flavored wine with a hint of toast and almonds. It is clean as a mountain stream, so fresh, but with some weight. And just look at the alcohol—11.5% That'll save your falling off your bar stool. Screwcap.
This solidly built, dry wine made from the unusual Tannat variety has mild apple and cherry flavors and great balance. Its texture is firm due to good acidity and a touch of tannin, which makes it versatile with foods from pho to barbecue.
Here's an interesting sparkler made with the relatively unknown Torbiana grape (from northern Italy) with a mature golden color and smoky notes of peach, pineapple and toasted bread. It's very drinkable with balanced creaminess and freshness.
A little watery but elegant, this Pinot is dry and crisp, with a light, silky texture. The flavors veer towards sour cherry candy, cranberry and tart, winter persimmon. Ready to drink now.
Dominated by Alvarinho, this is a spicy, fruity and tangy wine. It is still young with a tight mineral edge that will soften to bring out a more creamy character. The after-taste, with its fresh citrus, should remain. Drink from 2017.
A little simple and easy, but there's a wealth of raspberry, strawberry and floral notes in this delicate wine. It's a bit too sweet for my tastes, although it does have good acidity.
A blend of predominantly Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot with 10% Cabernet Franc, this opens with black-skinned berry, scorched earth and cooking spice aromas.

Rubber and prune are the lead aromas, and overall the nose is big but flat. Conversely, the palate is clacky and tough on the surface, with herbal, roasted-berry flavors. Dark and herbal on the finish as well, with a clunky, somewhat awkward fade. Not as clean and pure as the 2007 version.
This shows the elegance of Santa Rita Hills Pinot Noir. Dry and crisp in acidity, it has complex layers of sour cherry candy, white pepper and sandalwood, plus a touch of green herb. It evolves as it airs in the glass.

This dry, almost austere wine has some tasty but subtle characteristics including a toasty, slightly earthy and buttery aroma followed by subtle almond and apricot flavors. It will make a great choice with tapas or fish, and a nice change of pace anytime.
Fermenting in oak and using the rare Petit Meslier grape, Duval-Leroy has created a wine in its single-varietal Authentis range that is, to say the least, unusual.

It has rewarding cherry, blackberry, red currant, mocha and licorice flavors, balanced with rich tannins. Really stylish for drinking now.
Bright purple in color, a sure indicator that what's to come will be jammy and rich. The nose is all boysenberry and wood, with a hint of mineral. The palate is ultraripe but a bit clumsy and oversized. Not complex but very nice in a fruit-forward, knife-and-fork manner.

This young wine is high in acidity that offsets the ripe red and black cherry, mocha, cola and cinnamon spice flavors. It's elegant and complex now, and changes as it warms and breathes in the glass. There's a sugary sweetness on the finish.
Here's a rich and enjoyable Pinot Grigio with natural aromas of cantaloupe, almond nut and passion fruit. The wine is clean and light in the mouth and does a good job of keeping the palate refreshed.
A floral, heavy style of blended white made from Macabeo, Gewürztraminer and Chardonnay. It has an exotic streak to the aromas along with smoked ham, fennel seed and gardenia. The palate is thick and tastes of papaya, salami and baked apple. It's a hodgepodge of abnormal aromas and flavors, but all totaled it works pretty well.
This has black-skinned berry, forest floor and toast scents. The easygoing palate delivers tart cherry, vanilla and clove flavors alongside smooth tannins. Drink through 2019.
There's no bones about the use of oak in this wine, which spent nine months enjoying the cradling effects of a good barrel, the majority French and 25% American. Ample fragrances of lemon and lime infuse the well-balanced wine that is also marked by crisp minerality, cinnamon toast and pear.
A little too sharp, which gives this thin Pinot Noir a sting. But it's nice and low in alcohol, with attractive cranberry and cola flavors, and elegant enough to drink with anything calling for Pinot Noir. The price is pretty good for the quality.
A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and—surprise!—Zinfandel, this brings a swirl of red fruits into play, and wraps them in a skin of bark and slightly bitter earth. Peppery tannins and more forest floor flavors kick in at the finish.
Red and black berry, dark spice and Mediterranean herb aromas lead the nose on this straightforward, friendly wine. The juicy, savory palate offers crushed black cherry, black berry, dried herb and peppercorn alongside smooth, enveloping tannins.
You'll want to stash this young Cab away for a while because it's too closed and tannic now for enjoyment. But it has a very rich, concentrated core of cassis flavor and is dry and balanced in acidity. Should negotiate the next 6–8 years easily, and maybe longer.
A good, everyday wine, dry and crisp, with a fruity richness that makes it a good value. Shows honeyed flavors of lemons, limes, figs and vanilla, with a zesty spiciness.

Dry, harsh and rather dull, an overly soft wine with cherry and raisin flavors. Ready now.

As Virginia wines can sometimes struggle with acid retention, wines made using naturally high-acid varieties like Tannat are making waves.

Assertive, strapping tannins lay the foundation, and the uplifting acids add cut. Only 70 cases produced.

Big, bold and finely concentrated, this shows both rich fruit and structured tannins. Notes of cherry, black plum and a touch of smoky wood come together in this wine that needs at least three years to show at its best.
A soft and ripe wine, full of apricot and apple fruitiness. An intense background of acidity shines through the rich flavors and brings out a more tangy character. It's not for long-term aging; drink now for its fruit and freshness.
This single-vineyard offering opens with aromas of very mature—nearly overripe—black fruit and tilled soil. The palate is already evolved, showing fig, prune and cooked fruit along with espresso and oak. It finishes on a note of astringent wood tannins.
Very approachable and inviting, L'Aspetto (Sangiovese and Canaiolo) is a bold and dense wine with a dark ruby color and velvety tones that sit heavy on the tongue. Its aromas include black cherry, dried currant, pressed rose petal, Spanish cedar and exotic spice.
Rather grapey, front-loaded flavors move quickly into a subdued midpalate, with muted notes of ash and licorice. The wine seems a bit thin given its fairly high alcohol.
Powerful is almost an understatement in describing this big boy. The nose starts out fiery and rough before settling to intense. It's all guns blazing on the palate, where tight, racy raspberry fruit holds court. With intense oak and a molten core generating 15.5% alcohol you may want to tread carefully. The ride is not for the weak. Garnacha with Carignan, Syrah and Cab Sauvignon.
Ripe, spicy and full both of ripe fruits and tannins, this is a full-bodied wine that brings out the minerality and structure of a Douro wine. It has plenty of red fruits to balance these tannins, resolving into the wine that is firm but ready to drink.
One of the most balanced and impressive Barolos from the hot 2011 vintage, this opens with alluring aromas of mature black cherry, tobacco and spice.

Drink 2018–2031.
Delicate but inviting aromas suggest Spanish broom, stone fruit and lychee. The palate is round but vibrant, boasting juicy white peach, creamy green apple, energizing mineral and a citrus note.
This cool-climate bottling from the young producer shows tons of florality and spice, from violet and lilac to white pepper and dried herb, underscored by blueberry and tar aromas. It's light and lithe in body, with elderberry, potpourri and pepper flavors, but the tannic tension is most compelling, clinging to the palate from start to finish.
Lightly smooth and crisp, this is dominated by a citrus flavor and bright acidity. It's a typical, easy-drinking wine that's ready to consume now.

The wine is a serious Syrah that further establishes Kynsi's mastery of this variety, which is so hard to make into a complex wine. Drily tannic, it shows a fabulous range of flavors, among them blackberries, black cherries, chocolate-covered mints, licorice candy and plum jam, and even lighter, pastry notes of pecan sandy cookies. Might age for a while, but probably at its best now.
Lilac, crème de cassis and grape Jolly Rancher scents are layered with anise and lavender touches on the nose of this bottling from one of the winery's favorite vineyards. The palate dives into deep fruit flavors, like concentrated boysenberry and olallieberry, enlivened by Christmas spice, juniper and pine. It's all framed by an intense and unwavering tannic structure. Drink now–2028.
This Old World-style blend comes across medium in body, with an emphasis on dry red fruits. The nose is earthy and a touch leafy smelling, with vanilla shadings and lots of plum and berry. In the mouth, it's crisp and focused given its age, with raspberry, plum and strawberry flavors. A light finish with fading cherry notes is a good close. Drink through 2014.
This is a dark and dense wine that has solid perfumed fruits. The tannins, still dry, are partnered with blackberry fruits, spice and just a touch of wood. The wine needs to age, so wait until 2016.
This supple, medium-bodied wine packs in many of the notes that make Syrah from the Northern Rhône so compelling: coffee, tar, leather, black olive, chocolate and roasted meat, all backed by raspberry-cherry fruit. Enjoy the ride over the next several years.
This is a rugged, full-bodied and flavorful Cabernet. Aromas of gritty black cherry and cassis come with herbal undercurrents. The palate is tight, with firm tannins and foresty, lightly herbal flavors of cassis, wild berry, juniper and chocolate.  Drink through 2017.
This pink-colored wine comes from the Domaine owned by the Rabarin family for over 150 years. It is deliciously crisp, bright with acidity and with a tannic edge that comes from the Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend. This is a refreshing bright wine that is ready to drink.
91–93. Barrel sample. Fragrant aromas mark this almost delicate wine. While it does have richness and a full textured character, it's the lively acidity and crispness that gives it great elegance.
Simple and soft, a wine whose modest cherry and cedar flavors lack depth, structure and interest. It's okay, but there's very little going on, especially at this price.
Despite showing forced sweetness, this Catalonian blend always delivers in its price category. There's dusty lemon-lime and powdered sugar aromas and flavors along with papaya and green melon. It's never going to be a sophisticated white but it does get the job done for $5.99. And because of that there will always be a market for René Barbier Mediterranean White.
A simple, crisp and slightly stripped-back wine. The nose has red fruit, leather and light wood, while the palate races with cranberry and red cherry flavors. Overall it is fairly sheer and drying, but it will accent food without much effort.
The vintage was a great one not only for J's dry table wines but for its sparklers. This brut, a classic Chardonnay and Pinot blend, with a drop of Pinot Meunier, is dry, with complex lemon, orange, yeast, vanilla, cream and toast flavors. The bubbles are ultra-fine, raising the appeal.
Oak dominates this Porty wine, making it clumsy, with sweet, caramelized tastes riding over raisiny blackberry fruit.
An easygoing but nicely made Rioja that delivers purity, good fruit, body and feel. The nose is all cherry and berry, and it's a clear step up from your everyday red wine. The palate is medium bodied, with tasty, spicy flavors of cherry and raspberry. Lasting on the finish, with proper texture throughout.
The alpine conditions at Foris push this into a style that's different from Willamette Valley Pinot Blancs. Bracing minerality drives this bus, with refreshing flavors of celery, cucumber and green melon. It's persistent, squeaky clean and quite delightful.
Strange spice and ground cinnamon aromas shadow the fruit, which may be a good thing because the palate is flat and murky, with jammy, sweet flavors and not much follow up on the backside. Finishes creamy but bitter tasting.
With no oak on this wine, you can taste how beautifully Monterey terroir develops Chardonnay. The wine is all crisp acids and ripe flavors of guava, pineapple, mango and peach. Vanilla, too, which must come from the grapes, not barrels. What a delightfully drinkable wine this is.
Dominated by wood, it offers heavy oak and toasted sensations with a hint of butterscotch alongside fresh acidity, but it lacks fruit richness.
Aromas of rhubarb, herbs and strawberry mark the nose. This feels solid and mostly fresh, while flavors of pickled rhubarb and briny plum come with sugary sweetness in front of a salty finish.
Pickle and sweet funk on the nose give this chunky wine a nose that's less than fresh. Flavors of orange, peach and cantaloupe are sweet but flat, and in the end it tastes more like a fruit juice than a really solid dry rosé.
This fine wine has firm tannins and a solid feel from serious wood aging. The toast and spice flavors merge with the black fruits, the dark plums and the rich texture of this ripe wine. It is still young, needing further aging to soften those tannins. Drink from 2019.
Sonoma Valley stalwart Sam Sebastiani returns to the winemaking fold with this small-production Sangiovese. A juicy study in robust, powerful tannins and fresh plum, it has a trace of anise on the back of the palate. Blended with 8% Petite Sirah and 4% Malbec, it spent a year in older French oak barrels and is a delicious California version of the Italian classic.
Dry, spicy, earthy red-fruit aromas lead to a fresh palate with good body. Plum and spiced cherry flavors extend only so far, while this tasty little wine finishes dry, spicy and with a dusting of cocoa.
Wayward and slightly weedy on the nose, with candied fruit notes that help it along. The palate is more acidic and rhubarby than ideal, although the tartness is offset by a creamy flavor of carob bean. Short and hot on the finish; acceptable but not well executed.
Smooth but tangy, this offers good fresh citrus aromas and flavors, a softer-than-usual texture but a bright, clean character that stays fresh on the finish.
Judi Sorensen Flom
Dark gold in color, this wine was whole-cluster pressed and fermented for a lengthy six months, providing for a luxuriousness of stone fruit and melon dripping in honey and caramel. It's ripe and fleshy, with a slight voluptuousness. Aged in 50% new French oak for 17 months.
This wine has very dark flavor characteristics, and is almost completely dominated by the oak barrels (40% American) in which it’s been aging for 33 months. That’s a long time, and American oak has strong aromas and flavors, perhaps too strong. The tannins are pretty and supple, and the fruit that’s buried under all that wood seems lovely, but this wine should have been released two years ago.
Very closed and tight, this is still a young wine. Its fruitiness, with citrus and pear flavors, is just beginning to develop into something that's rich and full-bodied. With its steely structure and taught acidity, it shouldn't be drunk before 2016.
Leafy, herbal aromas of spicy berry fruits lean toward green. An edgy, acidic palate delivers herbal flavors of currant and plum, while the finish is spicy and herbal, much like a good tomato sauce.
This wine has aromas of oak, red currants and roasted coffee bean. Oak dominates the palate, with toasted sensations and espresso taking center stage over the subdued red fruit sensation. Overall, this is dried up and tannic, closing on an astringent note of wood tannins. Veritas Imports, Tanaro River Imports, Crown.
Sort of dry and cheesy smelling at first, but more fruity as you get to know it. The palate is lean, dry and evaporates fast, but along the way the cherry and olive flavors are solid, with some vanilla thrown in for good measure. About as much as you should expect for $7.
This South Eastern Australia Chard packs quite a punch for the price. The nose is fresh but subtle, with hints of hand soap and cut apples. There's a luxurious quality to the palate that melds well with flavors of almond and pear and carries over to the silky, medium finish. Winds up on a note of tropical fruit. Drink now through 2011.
A unique set of aromas is offered here including smoked ham and dry Graham cracker. The wine is easy, thin and offers a defined point of ripe cherry on the close.
Mild mannered Sauvignon Blanc, balanced and long, with jicama and herbal, leafy notes alongside melon and fig flavors. Nicely done.
Sultry, silky and sexy on the nose with rich baking and red-spice notes, this appellation blend by Brian Loring also shows ripe but acidic raspberry fruit, rose buds and cooked berries. The palate is bursting with cranberry and black raspberries, enhanced by graphite, nutmeg and black peppercorns. It finishes tight and clean, with a camphor lift.
This is a fragrant, perfumed wine that's full and ripe in feel. The structure is soft and gentle without any bite. It's a fruity wine for drinking young. Screwcap.
While earthy on the nose, the palate bursts with huge berry flavors on this powerful wine. Bold, ripe fruit is cushioned by tannins and penetrating acidity, lending a dark feel to its structure. Drink from 2015.
Despite its alcohol, this is actually a delicate, stylish, lemon-scented wine. There is an attractive perfume that shines through the oil and mineral texture. A great food wine.
Wonderful Merlot, rich and complex, with the classy mouthfeel that Napa provides so effortlessly. You might mistake it for a valley floor Cabernet for the new oak-infused blackberry, cherry and cocoa flavors and soft, immediate appeal. The tannins are there, but they're melted, sweet and gentle. Drink now.
All Pinot Noir, fermented in neutral oak and put through partial malolactic, this belongs in the rosé category. A pretty, pale-copper color, it offers a pleasing toasted-cracker frame around stone fruit and supple acids. Drink this chilled to white wine temperature.
Graceful, and elegant, this offers achingly pure, tart cherry fruit, accented with notes of compost, butter and nutmeg. It's a fine example of a brilliant wine from a so-called “lesser” vintage.
Floral and sweet, but not that light or ethereal. At 14.5% this represents the heavy, seriously ripe side of Torrontès. Flavors of pineapple and nectarine are borderline oily, while the finish toes the line of being aggressive. Flavorful but a rumbler. Imported by Banville & Jones Wine Merchants.
This wine seems to be quickly maturing. Scents of rose petals and cherries carry over into similar flavors, punctuated with a light dusting of cocoa powder. There's ample acidity, and the wine is completely ready for near-term drinking.
Lots of rich blueberry, cherry and blackberry fruit flavors in this Syrah. It's soft in the mouth, with a sweetness that's due to caramelized oak and the glycerine of high alcohol. Not an ager, but delicious now with charred beef.
Rock solid and compact. This wine is true-blue Brunello, meant to be cellared for 10 or more years. Flavors of plum, cherry and currant are pure, and there's far more fruit here than wood. But the tannins are like nails and they get harder and harder with each sip. Yes, it's a top-flight Brunello, but hold, for best results, until 2010.
A rare Washington Dolcetto, this has the expected tart acidity, along with peppery red fruit. Finished with a screwcap, it needs some extra breathing time, and as it opens it shows some pretty raspberry fruit and just a hint of dark chocolate.
Bordeaux has always had Malbec in its vineyards although it is rare. This unusual wine shows how, in a fruity year, the grape can work well. The tannins are soft, giving a juicy black-fruited wine that is forward and delicious to drink now for its succulent fruit.
This is a soft, somewhat dilute and simple white wine. Delicate suggestions of white peach and pear carry the bulk of the flavor.
The Optu red is 55% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot, 9% Malbec and 6% Petit Verdot. No Cab Franc, which seems to be losing favor among Washington winemakers. The 2007 is a much better Optu than its predecessor, nicely structured and balanced, with a blend of fruit, leaf, earth and barrel that is seamless and complex. Elegant and detailed, this is a wine to tuck away for a few years.
At the moment, the nose on this wine seems tight: It offers only subtle aromas of wild berry and cedar. Medium to full bodied, the palate bears a note of roasted herb, and the energizing acids and sandy tannins keep the wine structured throughout the finish.
Warm butter and light toasted oak scents meld with smoked lemon and walnut hints on the nose of this reserve bottling. The palate is soft and almost sweet upon entry, its cashew and roasted apple flavors buttressed by a grippy tannic texture.
With 10% Viognier added to this Chenin, there is a forward, earthy character to this wine, like a mix of honeysuckle and citrus-scented fynbos. The medium-weight palate shows melon and tropical fruit flavors while a lemon-lime accent freshens up the close.
Purple and tannic, with a grapey aroma and a suggestion of dusty earth. The most interesting of RiverAerie's pure varietals, perhaps because of its high-toned, slightly volatile mouthfeel. Berry/cherry fruit comes through sharply, then quickly fades into herbal tannins.
With its violet, berry, spice and leather sensations, this savory blend of 90% Sangiovese and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon/Merlot displays the quintessential perfume of a youthful Chianti Classico. The juicy wild cherry and ripe raspberry flavors are accented by notes of cracked black pepper and hints of grilled herbs that add depth. Refined and delicious. Drink 2014–2018. Trilussa Wine, J.W. Sieg Wines.
Enticing pressed rose, iris, woodland berry, Mediterranean brush and game aromas emerge from this succulent red. The palate is savory, doling out ripe wild cherry, black raspberry, grilled herb, white pepper flavors with a hint of sea salt. Firm but refined tannins and tangy acidity provide polished support. Drink 2020–2028.
Dry, crisp and herbal, with tobacco, cola, red licorice and tannic cherryskin flavors. A silky, polished Pinot for early drinking.
Testarossa is better known for Pinot Noir, but their Syrahs, and particularly those from Garys' Vineyard, are some of the best around. This 2009 is delectable now for its sheer drinkability. It's rich and luscious in blackberry, blueberry, smoked meat, pepper and earthy tobacco flavors, wrapped into smooth, complex tannins.
Terredora is a dynamic, family-run winery with deep roots in Irpinia wine tradition. The Fiano di Avellino opens with mature yellow and exotic fruit aromas with background notes of dusty mineral and crushed granite.
Apianae opens with a pretty golden color and delivers loads of beautiful, sweet flavors at an attractively low price. Orange zest, dried apricot and butterscotch are evident components of the bouquet.
The region of Lazio, in central Italy, is not known for its wines. However, it does have a few aces up its sleeve and this Grechetto-based wine (with fruit sourced from five different vineyards) is one of them. Thanks to its brilliant golden color and rich aromas of stone fruit, honey and caramel, this is a wine that pairs majestically with lobster, crab and smoked salmon.
This wine has yeasty aromas and a light character that brings out springy acidity before the dry botrytis. It is still forming itself around the dry core, waiting to become generous and rich. Drink from 2019.
Wines like this are why Yarra Valley has achieved a certain reputation for Chardonnay. It starts off with wonderfully complex aromas of spring flowers, honey, ripe peaches and citrus fruits, then crams honeyed hints of truffle and oranges into a full-bodied but dry expression of the grape.Finishes elegantly, with a dusting of dried spices.
There isn't much Sémillon in Portugal, but what there is can be easily affected by botrytis. This one has intense sweetness, balanced by dryness and lemon acidity. Ready to drink.
Packaged in a nifty double bottle that will keep the contents insulated and chilled, this bright Prosecco from Villa Sandi would be perfect to serve in the early afternoon with friends. It's luminous and crisp and would pair beautifully with puff pastry appetizers.
From the Erice area of Sicily in the southwest corner of the island, this bright Insolia offers crisp aromas of citrus, cut grass and white almond. It's a simple, genuine wine that is put together nicely.
With rich cherry fruits and a firmer underlying structure, this is a dense wine. It is still fresh and fruity but has also developed a broad, generous feel that gives weight. It is ready to drink.
Lean, dry raspberry aromas and a slight floral essence carry the nose toward a zesty, semisharp palate with crisp cherry and cranberry flavors. Not bad in a lean, stripped-back way; but there's no excess oak, weight or sweetness. Lean stuff for old-school palates nursing plates of ham or salami.
The Cowgirl Cab, a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, is DaMa's most popular offering. Loaded with bright, brambly berry fruits, licorice and loam, it's notable also for smooth, silky tannins.
Soft and opulent, relishing its rich fruits and round, velvet structure, this wine hits all the right notes. It's not all padded and soft: There are tannins there, wrapped in the richness and delicious fruit.
All of the fruit for this wine comes from Monette's Vineyard in the Rocks District, and it was fermented using 75% whole clusters. The aromas are fresh and perfumed, recalling red raspberry, pipe tobacco, white pepper, pomegranate, kirsch, herb and orange peel. The palate shows mesmerizing purity in its red fruit flavors, which are backed by fine-grained tannins. A thoroughly delicious interpretation of the variety that is nothing short of dazzling.
Bright black cherry and raspberry flavors take center stage in this unoaked Cabernet Franc. Juicy and ripe, it's best enjoyed now through 2016 to appreciate its forward, fruity exuberance.
Pallsier's second-tier Chardonnay isn't imported to the U.S., but for readers where it is available, it probably offers decent value. Subtle toast and lees add complexity to apple and citrus fruit. Crisp acidity and a chalky, slightly tannic feel make it a good with food.
With half Merlot, and the rest Cabernet Sauvignon and old-vine Petite Sirah, this is a gorgeously smooth wine, absolutely dry and sturdily tannic. The tannins are ripe and sweet, framing pure, complex flavors of cherries and raspberries, rhubarb-pie filling, cola and cocoa-infused coffee drinks, liberally spinkled with cinnamon and nutmeg. Worthy of careful attention. Certified biodynamically.
Blackberry and herbal aromas vie with raw oak and heat on the bouquet of this chunky, jammy, slightly sloppy feeling Monastrell. Dark plum, blackberry and baking spice flavors veer in the direction of clove, and overall this shows itself to be far more oak-based than pure.
Raw oak, coconut, roasted coffee bean and oak-driven spice sensations dominate the nose and the palate. It lacks the fruit richness necessary to support the raspy tannins that leave a rough, astringent finish.
A very fine example of Alexander Valley Cabernet Sauvignon, showing the elegance and complexity wines from that Sonoma County region can attain. Soft and intricate in tannins, the wine shows a mélange of blackberry, currant, cherry, sweet dried herb and smoky flavors that are delicious now, and should hold well for several years.
Run by the Nony family who also own Château Caronne Ste Gemme, this well-made wine has taken advantage of the fruitiness of the vintage. Ripe fruit is the hallmark here, juicy blackberry and soft tannins rounded by some wood aging. Drink from 2017.
Barolo Serre is not as intense as the Cannubi expression, although the wine does put its main focus on elegance and harmony. Aromas include anise, lavender flower, church incense, wild berries and ground ginger. Its bright fruit flavors unfold gently in the mouth and culminate in a drying, but firm finish.
A blend of Sauvignon Blanc, with one-quarter Sémillon, this white blend was aged on the lees in oak barrels. It shows the balanced elegance this bottling by Brander usually displays. Entirely dry, with a crisp burst of acidity, its flavors are of citrus fruits, white flowers, vanilla, minerals and a touch of tart, New Zealand-style gooseberry. Great with roast pork or, if you can get it, wild boar.
Soft and broad, with rich flavors of butter cookie, toasted coconut, baked pear and light citrus. Just 500 cases were made.
Tight green apple, lime zest, nectarine shavings and a green fruit-leaning kiwi element aligns nicely with the fresh yeast aromas on this sparkler's nose. Tart lemon, green apple skins and underripe orange show on the palate, which is framed by mouthwatering acidity and finishes on a white flower element.
Richly oaked, fantastically ripe in long hangtime fruit, this Chard has exotic flavors of golden mangoes, nectarines, passionfruit, pineapple jam and kiwis. Oak adds extra layers of buttered toast, crème brûlée and smoky vanilla. For all the honeyed sweetness, it's totally dry, a tour de force that's at its best now.
Shows the dry, lightly elegant mouthfeel that a pure Cab Franc should have, with polished cherry and vanilla flavors. But it struggles to rise beyond country-style.
Frankly sweet, with candied raspberry and cherry flavors. Feels soft and cloying.
Though the nose is a bit muted, assertive juicy black plum and muddled mulberry unfold in the round mouth. Firm tannins follow through to the dry, waxy finish. Try in another year or two, or give it a good long decant before drinking now.
Here's a lovely Rosso and a rare value wine from one of Tuscany's most prestigious wine-growing areas. Ciampoleto offers bright berry nuances, light shadings of exotic spice and a fresh, zesty finish.
From the Todi area of central Italy, this golden Grechetto opens with thick aromas of apricot, honey, butterscotch and mature melon. The wine sports a thick, creamy mouthfeel and would pair with pumpkin risotto.
This region is known for producing lean whites from grapes that tend to be blousy in warmer zones, and this bottling is no exception. It shows crushed chalk, pomelo and gardenia aromas on the nose and is tense on the palate, its grippy white rock flavors accented with Granny Smith apple notes.
Harmony is a good word to describe this spirited Bordeaux blend, with its perfumed black cherry nose accented with menthol and fresh-cut herbs. Fruit forward with ripe black fruits, dried herbs and a hint of olives on the palate, it's a medium-bodied red wine that's easily adaptable to an array of hearty meat and fowl dishes.
This textural wine offers berry, plum, black pepper, mushroom and baking spices. The time spent resting in barrels has put a pleasing hint of toast around polished tannins.
Here's a rare and exciting blend of Bosco, Albarola and Vermentino from a cooperative winery in the beautiful Cinque Terre region of northern Italy. You won't find these native grapes anywhere else and the wine is perfectly suited to the fresh fish dishes served in this gorgeous part of the world.
Looks good in the glass, with dry, peppery, tomato leaf aromas along with leather and some burning brush. Has a good feel to it, with proper acidity. The flavors are snappy and peppery as they suggest pie cherry and red raspberry. Mildy spicy and toasty on the finish.
This is a pretty wine based mostly on Negroamaro with some Malvasia Nera, showing a soft, velvety texture and sophisticated notes of cherry liqueur and blackberry syrup.
85-87 Barrel sample. Rather simple, juicy fruits make a stand, but green flavors spoil this wine. It needs more richness to reflect the vintage .
Dried lime rinds, wet cement, pear blossoms, honeydew melon and tangerine show on the nose of this bottling that is ever-so-slightly pink in the glass. Honeysuckle flavors meet with ripe pear and apple on the palate that is a tad sweet.
Pedro Ximénez is the grape for this fino-style wine, not the usual Palomino. It's made in the dry style, with peach, papaya and spicy, yeasty aromas. Where it differs most from a normal fino is in the mouth, where things get big and gangly. It's slightly bitter as well, with apple, lemon and an echo on the finish.
Not even El Bosque could escape the difficulties of the cool, extended 2007 vintage. While typically dark and bulky on the nose, it's also dull by Bosque standards, with oaky mocha and coffee stepping in as filler. The body is drawn and tannic, with oak, resin and dark berry flavors. Finishes resiny as well. By no means bad, but given Bosque's precedent it's not stellar.
Cab Franc is an emerging variety in Mendoza and this jammy fleshy version won't hurt the cause. Inky berry aromas are wide and fruity, not specific. A full-volume palate is a bit heavy, with blackberry, chocolate and peppery flavors. The finish hangs around with similar flavors, grapy weight and just enough acidity to maintain integrity.
From negociant Nicolas Potel's own vines, this wine is dense and smoky. It has spice and hints of licorice as well as rich red-cherry fruit. The tannins and the structure of the wine promise aging, so drink this concentrated wine from 2020.
The nose on this bottling leans a bit sweet yet remains zesty, with ripe apples, pears, lime sorbet and lemon-lime soda. But the sip is racy and sizzling with buoyant acidity, delivering tightly wound Bosc pear and Gravenstein apple flavors doused with citrus spray.
Grassy aromas send you toward a lean and gappy-feeling palate with rudimentary cherry and plum flavors blended with medicinal, green undertones. Turns more green on the finish.
While subdued on the nose, there's lots of lively lemon and tangerine flavor on the palate of this dainty Kabinett. It's zippy and spry but sharply penetrating with a lingering lime pith finish.
A hard, chewy wine, this brings tight flavors of cassis and black olive, plus an herbal edge that veers into bitterness. Chalky acids come up through an attenuated finish.
Tastes raisiny, overripe and sweet in cherry jam flavor, with a harsh, peppery mouthfeel. Basically drinkable, but not going anywhere.
From vintner Eugenio Collavini in Friuli (northeast Italy), comes this new brand of Prosecco. This interpretation shows loads of dry grass, green apple, spring flower and citrus. The effervescence is tonic and firm.
Straightforward and accessible, this opens with aromas of dark-skinned fruit, menthol and baking spice. The full-bodied palate offers dried black cherry, nutmeg and a hint of clove alongside chunky tannins that grip the finish.
Delicate aromas of white spring blossom and white stone fruit rise from the glass. On the vibrant palate, a hint of almond adds interest to yellow pear and a citrus zest note. It closes crisp and clean.
This is a very ripe and raisiny specimen from a rocky vintage. It's chunky and somewhat grating in the mouth, with balance issues. Prune, raisin and chocolate flavors finish without much structure or spine. Drink now.
This is the second vintage Sbragia has accessed this vineyard. The result is a spectacular 100% Cabernet, stunning now but cellar-worthy. It's a big wine, decadent in cassis and milk chocolate fruit that's massively oaked and ample in tannins, but somehow it all pulls together to make for balance and harmony. Should hold and improve through 2015, at least.
A Cab lover's Merlot, this wine is massively constructed, a behemoth of tobacco-laced blue fruit and smoke, nearing pie-like proportion. With time and/or a decant, it'll reveal pretty violet on the nose, and take on a sultry juiciness to overcome its weight. Lay this baby down through 2022.
Forest floor, leather, pressed violet and balsamic notes meld together in the glass. The palate is firm and linear, offering dried cherry, tart cranberry, crushed herb and licorice notes, set against youthfully assertive, fine-grained tannins. Drink 2019–2025.
The Cabernet Moravia grape is a cross between Cabernet Franc and Zweigelt. Here, it incorporates all of Cab Franc's leafy herbaceousness and Zweigelt's tart, cranberry flavors in a refreshing wine. It's delicate in concentration, but easy drinking, with lots of green, grassy notes on the finish.
This is a simple, friendly wine with a pretty dusty, mineral quality that frames fresher aromas of pear, peach and golden apple. It's a bit toned down in terms of flavors intensity but does end on a playful spicy note.
Musky aromas of white flowers and mustard come before a lean, lemony, restricted palate. Melon, lychee and lime flavors are tropical and slightly oily, with mustardy notes coming back on the finish.
A special spot for Syrah, Parmalee-Hill gets plenty of coastal fog and coolness, providing this gamy, silky 100% varietal wine with structure and buoyant acidity around a balanced weight of tar, black olive and dark cherry.
This bottling from a vineyard west of the Sta. Rita Hills by David and Anna deLaski explores the lower ripeness, exotically spiced range of Pinot Noir. Aromas of tart boysenberry, sour hibiscus, sumac and white pepper show on the nose. The palate picks up a bit more viscosity to deliver cranberry, Kalamata olive and cardamom flavors.
Dried blackberries, tar and pressed purple flowers decorate the extracted nose on this top-end bottling from one of Temecula's shining star producers. Dark chocolate and olallieberries flavor the palate, which is framed by decent tannins and offers vanilla-cookie warmth on the finish.
CQFD means Charte de Qualité Fûts de Chêne (oak barrels), two concepts in one wine. The flavors are of the richest fruit, freshened with acidity and enveloped in tannins. It is dark, a solid wall of flavor, finishing with a chink of light and acidity.
Lots of oak, but with tons of fruit and excellent balance the total package is extremely likable. There's smoke, rubber and bacon on the bouquet, and then comes a deep offering of black plum, berry and vanilla. With second and third layers of depth and complexity, this is a wine that exudes quality.
Strong wood smoke and grilled meat aromas lead to equally assertive oak and dried herb flavors, giving this wine extreme personality. It has medium body and rather soft tannins and texture to balance.
This creamy blend of Friulano and Ribolla Gialla offers beautiful intensity and bold aromas of yellow fruit, Golden Delicious apple, almond and honeydew melon. The wine's rich texture is both smooth and fine.
89–91. Barrel sample. Ripe and smoky in character, this wine is perfumed and lively with acidity. It has potential to be a delicious, fruity, friendly wine but tannins and minerality both add firmer depth.
A straightforward, medium-bodied wine that's not fussy, this offers generously expansive flavors of apple skin and pear, veering toward the tropical end of the fruit spectrum on the finish.
Dark and earthy up front, with aromas of blackberry, hard spices and fresh tomato. The palate is jammy and deep, with brimming tannins supporting earthy, woodsy flavors of blackberry, moss and licorice. Flattens out somewhat on the finish, turning heavier and more rich. Drink over the next two years.
This bottling is very showy on the nose with tons of white flowers, tuberose, guava and mango, though a slice of lime peel cuts the tropicality a bit. Guava peel, feijoa and bitter limes show on the sip, where that slightly treacly tropicality reigns.
There's a detectible fynbos character to the herbal edge of this wine, mingling with the white peach and gooseberry fruit aromas and flavors. A clementine citrus edge remains through the long finish.
88-90 Barrel sample. Ripe, but firm wine, its blackcurrant freshness tucked into stark tannins. Black plum juice gives both acidity and sweetness. The final is a balanced wine, lifted by spice.
This Napa-side-of-Carneros Chardonnay is resplendent in crisp yet hearty aromas of apple, pear and flowery jasmine. Well put-together, it offers electric acidity and enough rounded texture to pair magnificently with food. On the finish is a hint of tarte Tatin, a tiny seasoning of cinnamon and nutmeg on top.
This explodes aromatically with honey and apricot and is balanced and silky on the palate, with 13.9% residual sugar. Somewhere midway through and on the finish, a hint of jalapeño provides a stark segue, before an appearance of pear and honey saves the day.
A 100% varietal wine from a great appellation, this has a weightiness of tannin on the entry that softens in the glass, unveiling classical characteristics of blueberry and violet, the oak subtle and spicy on the finish.
A remarkable wine for under $20, well made and varietally defined in cinnamon, white pepper and gamy red fruit.
This wine has a great future, offering good acidity, crisp fruitiness and a tangy aftertaste. But in six months it will reveal a richer yellow fruits that will give it a rounded, ripe character. Wait until 2017.
Decent everyday Zin, dry and spicy, with rich tannins and ripe dark berry, coffee and tobacco flavors veering into bitter dark chocolate. Nice with pasta in a tomato sauce.
A rare grape in Oregon, this is a bright garnet shade and scented with cranberry and raspberry fruit. Acidity brings significant snap to the flavors, so much so that for many tasters it will show best with some greasy/smoky grilled meats. A hint of Band-Aid comes up in the finish, but does not distract.
Stagecoach is a highly regarded vineyard, but this Zinfandel doesn't show it at its best. This wine is too high in alcohol, and it has Port-like prune and blackberry flavors. It has hard tannins that surface without sweetness.
This strengthens the argument that there's a place for different kinds of white wines to be made in the Napa Valley, emphasizing fruit freshness and acidity without sacrificing flavor or soul. Juicy apricot and green apple ride a wave of unoaked refreshment and refinement, all within a crisp framework of deliciousness. Lavender and honeysuckle seduce quietly.
Deep cherry, cocoa, and cedar aromas, and flavors of plum, black cherry and chocolate are in full play here. The even, medium-weight mouthfeel is well balanced and the long finish has fine, dusty tannins. A handsome example of the new, well-oaked style that will improve over the next three years.
Fragrant with pretty berry scents, this compact wine rewards some hours of breathing time. The tangy fruit is complemented by streaks of herb, mineral and citrus peel, all woven together into a gently fading finish that adds a lick of dark chocolate.
This grassy North Coast offering has plenty of lime, kiwi and jalapeño flavors that are able to stand up to spicy appetizers with its crisp, long finish. Proceeds are donated to the restoration of watersheds for steelhead trout and coho salmon.
Intriguing and distinct aromas of lemon meringue, jasmine and perfumed ripe apple show on this bottling of a grape not grown much in this region. It's lean and racy on the sip, clinging to bright lemon zest and citrus-pith flavors, with a tart texture. These vines are promising.
Crisp and lively from the start, this offers bright notes of apple, melon rind, white peach and orange on the nose and palate. Brisk carbonation assists in keeping the palate fresh and clean, while accents of apple skin and toast grace the close. It's a young sparkler, so give it some more time to develop additional layers of nuance and complexity. Try after 2017.
A little on the sharp, green and minty side, with tart acids framing cherry, black raspberry and smoky wood flavors. A good wine that could use more lushness and richness.
Two thirds Syrah and one-third Mourvèdre, this highly aromatic rosé features hints of passion fruit alongside confected, bubblegum flavors balanced by a squirt of lime on the finish. Drink now.
This feels a little thin at first sip, but it's balanced and shows tart cherry fruit that has attained a modest level of ripeness. It has a pleasing softness in the mouth, opening into a mix of plum and red cherry, with some phenolic bite.
Okay for everyday drinking, this simple Zin is soft, smooth and one-dimensional. It's enormously ripe, with sweet black cherry, raspberry and chocolate flavors.
Rich red cherry, anise and a bit of smoke show on the nose of this affordably priced bottling from Kevin Riley. The palate is quite grippy, with flavors of dried blueberry, dark chocolate and black coffee.
This Sauvignon's winning cards are elegance and harmony. The wine offers delicate fragrances of passion fruit, chives, chopped herbs and lily of the valley. The mouthfeel is crisp, clean and sharp and polished all at the same time. Pair with quiche Lorraine.
This engaging, full-bodied and densely textured wine has a great bouquet and structured yet fine-grained tannins. It exudes an engaging mix of spices, smoke and cedar in the aroma, and serves equally layered and complex fruit and spice flavors. Best after 2018.
The Sigrid never fails to deliver lush fruit and hedonistic barrel flavors. However in cooler years, when the alcohol falls below 14%, it has something extra when details of skin and flower emerge as well. This is a wine of power and finesse, with juicy pear and peach, supple acids, brioche and toasted biscuit, underscored with refreshing minerality. Drink now through 2025.
Soapy aromas are oily, heavy and slightly tropical. This is a low-acid Moscato with almost no pulse. Sweet flavors taste artificial, and there's no lift or pop to the palate. A finish suggestive of bath soap, powdered sugar and vanilla holds no sway.
A curious mix of 77% Pinot Gris and 33% Chardonnay from a sought-after vineyard site, Buddy's is oaky, salty and thick, with a floral bouquet that lightens its load and represents the Pinot Gris component well. It may need more time to harmonize.
This is the first Cabernet Sauvignon release from Meomi founder Joe Wagner. Sourced from vineyards across the appellation, it shows simple yet focused dark cherry and chocolate flavors, dusty tannin and subtle oak, within a framework of moderate acidity and ripeness.
Earthy aromas of forest floor, mushroom and herbs share space with more typical blackberry, cassis and shoe polish scents. This is bold but mildly tartaric and scratchy in feel. Blackberry, coconut and vanilla flavors display the wine's core ripeness and oak content, while the finish is long and flavorful, with density and weight. Drink from winter 2016 through 2022.

This is spicy and dry on the nose, with a cheesy accent. It feels medium in body, with sharp acidity that creates a semisour flavor profile of red plum and cherry. Not overly flavorful, it concludes with a crisp, cleansing finish.
It's herbal, grassy and thin. There's a good food pairing out there somewhere, but don't look for much varietal character.
This has a toasty edge that complements the ripe red fruit and attractive lemon and yeast character. It seems to be well on its way to maturity, retaining a fruity style while its flavors are beginning to dig deeper.
A light yet concentrated Pinot Noir, this has a cherry flavor and a spicy texture. Give it some air to allow the better side of its earthy aromas time to unravel.
A blend of Arinto and Antão Vaz, the wine is light, bright and attractively perfumed. It has juicy, tangy character, enhanced by the lemon zest and made richer with the melon fruits. Drink now.
Fruity and rustic, with a rough mouthfeel framing ripe cherry-berry flavors. Okay for everyday fare such as barbecue and pizza.

Delicate aromas of hawthorn, white spring flower and a whiff of orchard fruit aromas lead the nose on this refined sparkler. The vibrant palate doles yellow apple, citrus zest and toasted breadcrumb accompanied by an elegant mousse.
This was co-fermented with 3% Viognier. It's a very light Syrah that punches below its weight and skirts around the edges of clear varietal character. Citrus skin flavors and thin red fruits push it close to generic red, serviceable but without the power of most Washington Syrahs in this price range.
One sniff tells you plenty: there's attractive spice, coffee and leather to go with rich molasses and broad black-fruit aromas. The palate maintains balance due to fine, fresh acidity, and the flavor profile brings mocha, coffee, berry, plum and toast. Delicious, deep, layered and refined. Will age for at least 5–6 years, but best from 2012–2014.

This is a young, fruity wine made for early drinking. With bright acidity, soft tannins and forward red fruit, it's easy-drinking and ready now.
Crisp acidity combined with ripe fruit is pleasant here, but this blush is a tad heavy and lacking in delicacy. The color is dark, and the wine is rich with raspberry jam and spices.
Aromas of honeysuckle, hay and stone fruit carry over to the palate along with peach, green apple and citrus. Fresh acidity leaves a clean, crisp finish.
Showing austerity via its tannins, this is a severe wine despite its red berry fruit. It has layers of wood and a dry core. Age for six years or more.

Stumbles where Santa Barbara Cabs have historically fallen, with green, unripe flavors and tannins and a dry, bitter finish. This wine was not helped by the cool vintage.
Honey, lime rinds and just ripe peach greet the nose on this dry single-vineyard expression by Michael Callahan. The palate is extremely vibrant and citrus-driven, with a very chalky minerality and a very slightly oxidized touch of nuts on the finish. It's minerally mean and extremely, bracingly dry.
Aromas of dark berry, fragrant blue flower, chopped herb and a whiff of baking spice float out of the glass. The lively enjoyable palate doles out juicy wild cherry, cranberry, thyme and a hint of anise alongside smooth, supple tannins and firm acidity.
This soft style contains a warm, crushed strawberry flavor and ripe acidity, which creates a warm and rounded feel. The wine an edge of bitterness to to a slight hint of tannin. Disgorged November 2011.
In this ripe wine, solid tannins are attractively balanced with red fruits. It does have a cool character from the vineyard, showing structure as well as delicious fruitiness. Drink from 2016.
It's no wonder this wine is called Kaleidoscope: a blend of Viognier, Gewürztraminer, Riesling and Muscat, it's unique and multifaceted. The varieties have come together very satisfactorily, giving perfumed and plenty of ripe fruitiness. With its touches of lychee, apricot and spice and crisp, tight acidity, it's ready to drink now.
Deep, sweet dark-cherry fruit forms a solid foundation for this impressive wine. There's a touch of menthol oak on the nose; plenty of leather and earth accents in the mouth, coupled with good acidity, keep the palate complex and lively. Finishes long, with full—but not harsh—tannins. Editors' Choice.
A plummy interpretation of Merlot, this also brings aromas and flavors of herbs and spice. Flavors are sweet and easy drinking with lightly grainy tannins.
A big, ripe wine, it shows richness from the superripe grapes. It is bold, full-bodied and packed with juicy black fruits. It's like a fruit bomb, but structure holds it together. Drink from 2015.
Misceo is a GSM blend, vinified in a mix of new, once-filled and neutral barrels. The woody flavors and aromas dominate, with hints of sandalwood, cocoa and dust around tart blue fruits.
Soft and syrupy, with semisweet flavors of berries and anise.
This wine has firm tannins certainly. However its main character is the delicious, juicy fruit that just bursts out of the glass. A fresh character suggests this wine will develop quickly, despite the tannic background. Drink from 2016.
Does its Petite Sirah duty by being a deeply-colored, bone-dry, full-bodied wine of great tannic intensity. It's deeply flavored too, with masses of blackberries, black currants, cola, leather and pepper. A very nice wine for barbecued beef.
Inky dark and full-bodied, this Syrah has all the hallmarks of a young wine. It's dry and extremely rich in blackberry, wild cherry and blueberry flavors, accented with smoky oak, violets and pepper. Really nice, but maybe too soft for aging.
Plenty of barrel char and spice get it going, and behind those aromas there's leather and meaty fruit aromas. Flavors of plum, blackberry and chocolate work the palate, while the finish is easy going and smooth but fairly innocuous in its feel and lasting impression.
An aromatically appealing wine with notes of cinnamon, chocolate and cherry. Unfortunately, it's quite tart with grainy, somewhat bitter tannins.
86-88 This could work as a rich wine, because there is good structure and piles of botrytis. It could be delicious, with its lovely dry finish, but that's for the future.
This beautifully balanced wine boasts and enviable combination of structure and finesse. It opens with enticing aromas of pressed rose, iris, wild berry, cake spice and a whiff of pressed powder while the full-bodied palate delivers ripe black cherry, crushed raspberry, white pepper, star anise and clove. Firm, ultra-fine tannins provide the framework. Drink 2020–2032.
Chardonnay and the local Fernão Pires give a broad and soft wine. It's lightly perfumed and equally lightly textured. Gentle and ready to drink, it's  smooth and rounded at the end, perfect as an apéritif.
A very big, jammy Pinot Noir. Purists will object that it's too extracted, but it's awfully good and nicely silky in the mouth. Tastes like a liquid fruit bar, with cherry, raspberry, milk chocolate, roasted almond, honey-granola and caramel flavors.
A tough, gritty wine, dry and tannic, with some decent berry and cherry flavors. It's the kind of red wine that will happily wash down a cheeseburger.

Not showing much beyond a huge, unbalanced plaster of charred oak. Smells and tastes like toothpicks.
Intensely fruity, this wine is, unusually for a Provence rosé, in need of some time to calm down. Its acidity and red-currant fruits are almost too much at this stage. When it softens out, it will be delicious. Here's your holiday wine for end of 2017.
There's a hard edge to the mocha, herb and cherry aromas. The palate has blocky, dry tannins that distract.

Just a single barrel of this designate was bottled—too bad, as it's a tasty wine with bold fruit flavors of cranberry and cherry. Baking spices and a streak of cola come through also, and this should drink nicely into the mid-2020s.

Rich scents of baked apple, clove-spiked orange, honeysuckle and hazelnut crisp dance on the nose and mouth, but the palate remains lifted with fresh acidity and a saline note. Accents of spice and toast remain through the long close. A gorgeous wine now, but it should age beautifully through 2015.
Why reach for a lean, tart Chianti when you could have this varietally correct but friendlier Sangiovese? Aged half in stainless steel and half in large Slavonian oak casks, this wine's black cherry and plum fruit flavors are carried by soft tannins, but still show hints of tobacco leaf on the finish.

Light, freshly red cherry-dominated wine. The light tannins are a background to the acidity and the fresh fruit. Easy style of Beaujolais.
Luis Pato's Bairradas used to be the standouts of the D.O. In a sense they still are, although he has chosen to label them with the regional denomination of Beiras in protest over restrictive practices. In this example, Pato has harnessed the rough tannins and brash acidity of Baga into a rich creamy wine filled with blackberries and anise. It's still tannic and crisp, but it just needs another 10 years in the cellar to become fully appreciable.
This “Barrel Select” Syrah has been ripened to pruneyness, yet remains short, hot and simple. It could be any red grape left to hang late and fermented at (perhaps) high temperatures.
Overly green, with herbal flavors that overpower the mocha, cherry and vanilla notes. Decent texture and a dusty, clean finish.

The grapes come from three vineyards: Georges III in Rutherford, Tokalon in Oakville and Stagecoach, up on Atlas Peak. That helps explain the wine's beauty. It's pure California, cult-style Cab, soft and generous, with voluptuously ripe black currant and black cherry flavors elaborately enriched with spicy, smoky, 100% new French oak. My only quibble is that it could use a little more subtlety.
With old vines from a single vineyard, this wine has some good weight and concentration. Ripe peach and pineapple flavors are supported by a touch of spice as well as a warm finish. Screwcap.
More assertive and full-bodied than many versions, this wine smells like snap peas and spring flowers, but gets richer on the palate as peach flavors come out and mingle nicely in the unusually rich texture.

Purple in color, with blackberry and leather aromas. Black cherry and plum lead the flavor profile, while coffee, toast and black pepper carry the finish. Has good acidity but seems a touch short on depth and complexity.
Brimming with ripe boysenberry and blueberry compote aromas and complemented by a fudgy chocolate streak, this Syrah is lush and decadent, with good balance and an approachable yet mouth-filling structure. Flecks of black pepper and coffee grinds linger on the medium-length close.
Your basic everyday Zinfandel, with candied raspberry and cherry fruit, toast and pepper flavors, as well as a streak of green unripeness.
A 100% Chardonnay blanc de blancs that is presented without any dosage to soften the acidity. Yet it doesn't seem to matter, because this Champagne is deliciously ripe, packed with mature fruit flavors, a touch of almonds to go with the white currant tastes and a layer of toastiness. Imported by Michael Skurnik Wines.
Stemmy and earthy, as it smells like a mud puddle with herbal fruit mixed in. Tastes more like bitter, rubbery cherry than anything, and it's hard and dry on the finish, with a lasting flavor of baked beans. Not the worst thing going but not very good either.

Combine a warm year with too much time in bottle and this is what you get. This chunky, barrel-fermented Verdejo smells and tastes of early oxidation; it's creamy on the palate and strained in terms of flavors. Wheaty, leesy, faded melon and apple flavors have lost their verve.

Drink now–2015, maybe beyond.
Co-fermented with 3% Viognier, this has a nice peppery lift. The fruit flavors seem less forward, with the herbal components much more front and center.

Sonorous nutty notes meld with herbal spice. Tangy grapefruit zest swings into there somewhere, as does a much clearer note of green Conference pear. This is closed but smooth and will open up like a flower bud. On the palate, there is a wonderfully pliant, lemon-accented texture of real freshness.
A rounded, ripe, sweet wine, touched with caramel and dry figs. There's generous, rich fruit, and a feeling of warmth from spice and dark plums. Ripe, leavened with acidity for aging.
Aromas of ripe black fruit, spicy plum, graphite and a whiff of brine lead the nose of this robust wine. The round, savory palate doles out juicy blackberry, blueberry, licorice and ground black pepper alongside brawny tannins. It ends on a bitter prune note.
Using Ripanço, an old technique of destemming the grapes after harvest with wooden rods, the wine has intense color and a smooth, rich character. It is rounded and soft, with a light layer of tannins offering backbone to the generous fruitiness. Drink after 2015.
Tart lime and gooseberry aromas turn plush and plump on the palate of this lip-smackingly ripe spätlese. Apricot and yellow peach flavors penetrate deeply, catapulted by shards of lemon-lime acidity. It's breathlessly light in body, yet lingers long, leaving airy kisses of blossom and fresh herb in its wake. Irresistible already but should improve through 2025.
You'll find aromas suggesting underbrush, wild berry, tobacco and a whiff of aromatic herb on this. The palate isn't quite as expressive as the nose and is still tightly wound, offering red cherry, cranberry and white pepper alongside a backbone of tense tannins and bright acidity. Give it time to unfold. Drink 2025–2035.
A firm and very structured wine, this is for long-term aging. At this young stage, the fruit seems extracted, but this will pass as the weight of the dense damson skin and tannic character shines through. Complex and finally ripe.
Made in a sweetly ripe, oaky manner, this is a drink-me-now Pinot Noir. Easy to like for its jammy raspberry, cherry and Dr. Pepper cola flavors. The acidity and soft tannins define the modern Russian River style.
Zoémie De Sousa is a négociant brand created by Erick de Sousa in 2004 to satisfy world demand for his wines. A 100% Chardonnay from the Côte des Blancs, this deliciously creamy Champagne has lightness, freshness and great flavors of crisp apples and grapefruit. A bonus with De Sousa Champagnes is the disgorgement date indication—the older, the better. Imported by Lafayette Wines.
An impressive Syrah, not just for its ripeness, but for the structure. Fine, firm tannins and acids, along with well-integrated oak, provide a classic framework to the ripe blackberries, leather and chocolate. Good now, with decanting, but really wants 2–4 years of aging.
Robertson has managed to create a solid, appealing Chardonnay at an excellent price. This one has a big nose of fresh fruit and orange citrus, and on the palate, assertive fruit and toast. Not terribly complex but definitely robust and flavorful, this is an ideal everyday white.
I applaud the fact that Paillard clearly labels his wines with the date of disgorgement—this one was August 2005. The wine immediately offers up enticing scents of peaches, apricots and cherries. It's a full, fruit-powered Champagne that's round and rich and unusually ripe. It delivers a lot of flavor up front, and holds there through a clean finish.
This Hungarian dessert wine has a light, elegant nose of citrus and flowers and on the palate offers deep, delicious flavors of honey, orange and citrus. Luxurious and unctuous, it feels slightly heavy on the tongue and could use a touch more acidity. Overall, though, it's a very compelling wine with great character.
The winemaker has crafted a tight, minerally, Chablis-style wine that's high in acidity. You won't find cascades of fruit or massive oak here, but tart citrus and green apple flavors and a firm, steely mouthfeel. Yet the wine possesses an undefinable quality of elegance. Cellar this for as long as you like.
Mourvèdre, Grenache and Syrah constitute the blend in this simple blush wine. It's tart in acids and a little off-dry, with rosehip tea, raspberry, cola, mineral and spice flavors.
This feels a bit sharp in the mouth, the oak (25% new) punching through some fairly light fruit. Wild-berry flavors come up against chewy tannins. The wine has some power, but lacks a little bit of balance at the moment.
This is a stony, savory style of rosé, with its ample weight backed by firm acids and only modest melon fruit. It's a style better suited to food than casual sipping on its own.
Collaboration Series III is also Syrah, a blend of four clones, giving a meatier, less toasty wine than the Series II Syrah, but with the same imprint of Ciel du Cheval fruit. Flavors include various herbs and spices, green coffee, dark fruits, streaks of espresso and baker's chocolate. More complex flavors unravel as it breathes—streaks of licorice, smoke, graphite and earth.
Crisp, dry and fresh, this is a lively and fruity wine. It's lightly textured, tangy and clean as a whistle. Drink now.
Luce della Vite opens with an inky dark appearance and added extraction that is hard to find otherwise in 2008 Brunello. Soft aromas of cherry and blackberry are followed by supple fragrances of leather and spice. There is fruit pulp in the mouth and the wine's extra richness really helps to balance out its acidity and those still-young tannins.
Cantodoro is a blend of Nero d'Avola (80%) and Cabernet Sauvignon that is packed tight with bright fruit and pretty shadings of exotic spice and tobacco. It's a balanced, fresh red wine that would pair well with roast chicken or beef.
A pretty, polished and silky Pinot Noir, nice for drinking now with lamb or grilled steak, especially with some char to play off the wine's smoky oak. Shows rich flavors of raspberries, red cherries, cola, vanilla and sandalwood, in an elegant texture.
Hints of aromatic orange peel and white summer blossom add a certain exotic headiness to an earthy white blend from Burgenland. The palate is slender but laden with appetizing fruit flavours on surprisingly light, delicate feet—the result of sunny summer days and cool nights. Drink this soon to make most of those enticing, primary fruit notes and lasting aromas.
There's lots of seemingly sweet, jammy raspberry and cherry flavors in this Syrah. It has good Central Coast acidity that gives it a pleasant bite, but it never quite climbs above ordinary.
Marked by red berry fruits and soft tannins, this has a juicy character, with touches of wood aging that are already integrated. The aftertaste, with its fresh currant acidity and rounded fruit, shows that this will be ready to drink soon. Drink from 2016.
Simple and sugary, with blackberry and cherry jam flavors and a solid plaster of sweet, caramelized oak. Production was 20,000 cases.
Yeast and pineapple with notes of juicy mango are signaled on the nose. There is an intriguing core of savoriness, spice and saltiness. Herbs and yeast speak as much as wonderfully pure lemon and tangerine peel—but that added spiciness evokes curiosity and appetite. Very invigorating.
One of the best $15 red blends being made today. Carrascal gives us 45% Malbec, 35% Merlot and 20% Cabernet in rock-solid form. The nose has toast, mineral, balsam wood and good berry fruit, and the palate provides the troika of cherry, raspberry and plum with no interference or oaky gimmicks. Pleasant, warm and long on the finish.
This marks the debut of the Ramos Vineyard Chardonnay, inspired by a high-elevation site planted in 2001 by the late Bob Sessions and Jose Ramos, now director of vineyard operations. The wine paints a portrait of high-toned, elegant minerality accented by peach and lithe lemon. Capable of aging, it dances in acidity, with just a hint of caramel-vanilla on the finish. Made in tiny quantities, it's worth desperately seeking out.
Minerally cherry and raspberry aromas are as crisp as the black volcanic soil this varietal Listán Negro comes from. Bright in color, juicy and aggressive on the palate, with candied cherry flavors that are short on complexity, this Canary Islands wine tastes of berry residuals and brown sugar on the finish.
Oyster Bay has turned a nicely supple, easy-drinking 2009 Pinot Noir at a realistic price. Toast and vanilla notes accent strawberry fruit, finshing clean and fresh. Drink now.
Fermented in the bottle, this opens with inviting aromas of baked bread, citrus and orchard fruit. The dry linear palate delivers lime, green apple and mineral alongside refreshing acidity and a refined perlage. It closes crisp and clean.
Mouthwatering, high-toned acidity and a pleasant lemon-lime bitterness keeps the honeyed apple characteristics of this semisweet style Riesling in balance. Elegant mineral and petrol notes lead to a lingering, puckery finish.
100% varietal, this wine is a blend of fruit from Ciel du Cheval and Force Majeure vineyards. The dark fruit, mineral, meat, white pepper, green herb and savory aromas are initially brooding but intriguing. The palate packs a big wallop of dark-fruit flavors, bringing a lot of hedonistic appeal. It's not for the faint of heart but it delivers.
Blueberries and spice—think baking spices and cracked pepper—mingle easily in this medium-bodied, velvety-textured Syrah. Vanilla oak makes an appearance as well, but overall the wine is savory, with ample spice and structure. Drink now–2020.
This full-bodied Chardonnay begins with aromas of vanilla toast, herbs and cream, followed by toasty spice and fruit flavors. The finish is lingering and curvy. Not terribly complex, but a good cohort to lobster, crab and creamy pasta dishes.
With a preponderance of Touriga Nacional and Tinta Roriz, this ripe, smooth wine comes from the central Douro in Pinhão. It is fruity, with attractive red fruits and acidity. Tannins are gently in the background, leaving the fruit right up front.
This is a little soft and fleshy at moments, while at other times the nose is intense and sturdy. Full and tannic, this has foresty, slightly stewed berry flavors that heat up and turn chunky and toasty on the finish.
Produced from Pinot Noir, this is a particularly crisp example of a Sancerre rosé. It has red-currant fruitiness along with an edge of tannins. The finish is smoothed with caramel. Drink now.
Has sweet, though not candied aromas—think coconut, truffle, white chocolate, maybe some honey. Yellow peach and lychee flavors have a powdery feel that continues on through the finish. Not a sizeable, fat Viognier, which isn't at all a bad thing.
Big fruited wine, its wood element just a support for the ripe black berry and cranberry flavors. The tannins are a big element here, firm and very dry, but with the fruit freshness, the wine is ready to drink.
Fragrant on the nose with fresh orange, lemon and honeysuckle aromas, this full-bodied Chard is deliciously quaffable with a concentrated apple palate and just a hint of buttered toast. Another well-made Romanian at an unbeatable bargain price.
Spicy in plum and cherry, this is a full-figured effort with mildly smooth tannin and oak that fills the palate with dense force. On the finish is a mix of cola and cardamom.
A sweet sparkling wine that is fresh and clean, this comes from the south of France. The light, crisp character with some acidity leaves a fresh aftertaste. This is a new release from Barton & Gustier.
Potting soil, pencil lead, vanilla, flower and cherry aromas lead to dense, pitch-black-fruit flavors. There's a lot of tannic heft but it's well integrated.
This “heart of the harvest” Gamay is produced from 100-year-old vines, a rarity in any appellation. With less than five acres to work with, this ripe and structured wine shows the potential even of “simple” Beaujolais-appellation wines. It has weight, spice and warm red fruits that are laced with acidity. Drink this wine from 2016.
Perhaps this wine could be drier, as the orange and apricot flavors seem to finish with a touch of sweetness. Still, it's clean and brisk in acidity. This should pair well with slightly sweet Asian fare.
This lovely sparkling wine from northern Italy opens with a refined perlage of small, persistent bubbles. The fragrance offers hints of yellow apples and a whiff of bread crust. There is nice length and it finishes on an almond note.
Pears and honey go together in this rich wine. Perhaps the power is too much, but it certainly impresses with its mineral structure, green spices and complex mix of exotic fruits and reined-in intensity. Screwcap.
Barolo Serre is made with fruit sourced from various vineyard sites. This gorgeous wine opens with a modern touch of sweet spice and toasted nut lavished over ethereal aromas of cherry liqueur and dark licorice. Drink in 5–10 years.
This savory Rosso weaves together sensations of Morello cherry, wild strawberry and crushed raspberry lightly accented with notes of cinnamon and clove. It's round and ready to enjoy now with hearty Tuscan soups or mildly seasoned pecorino cheese.
This doesn't show any particular Stags Leap character; it's another dry, tannic and lean Cabernet, with cherry syrup flavors. Drink now.
This seems a bit fiery on the nose, with tomato, exotic berry, herb, coffee and earth aromas. It feels raw and tannic but serious, with zesty, herbal flavors of briary berry and oak. The herbal Elqui character appears on the the finish.
Hay, pressed yellow flower and hazelnut aromas lead the nose in this deeply hued wine. The nutty note carries over to the evolved palate, with fennel and candied citrus zest flavors. It still boasts fresh acidity despite its age, but drink now to enjoy the remaining fruit.
This is pure Viognier, finishing in a moderately sweet, dessert-friendly style. There is a candied sensation to the mouthfeel, and the fruit seems rather thin. Light flavors of orange pekoe carry into a gentle finish.
A small vineyard of six acres is used to produce this magnificent incarnation of Malbec. Black as ink and firmly tannic, a toughness magnified by new wood, this is still a richly fruity wine that will age superbly to give power and complexity. Keep for at least four years.
Very fragrant and tropical on the nose. In the mouth, this Chard offers the same pear, banana and other tropical fruits spread broadly across the palate. Its texture is a little thick, but at this price, this wine more than does its job. Imported by Freixenet USA.
This smells superripe—the fruit seems almost caramelized—but there's also a refreshing bright beam of citrus as well, bringing the sweetness into balance. At the moment, there's a bit of a disconnect between the honeyed flavors and crisp, lime-like acids, but these elements should come into better harmony over the next few years.
Birds got most of the 2004 Grenache, but the 82 cases that were left are impressive. Along with biting red fruits that seem to snap and sizzle in the mouth, there is a nice, spicy edge that gives the wine dimension and scale. The tannins are austere and taste of graphite and bark.
Aromas of acacia flower, broom and a toasted note lead the nose. The palate offers light oak, yellow apple and lemon drop alongside racy acidity.
Mocha and milk chocolate seem to waft from this ruddy, ripe wine made from Marquette grapes. Ripe cherry and strawberry flavors are soft and plush on the palate, brightened by a welcome streak of acidity.
Dark-skinned berry, pressed violet, pipe tobacco and chopped herb aromas take center stage. The smooth juicy palate is already approachable, offering fleshy morello cherry, fig, licorice and a hint of black tea. Velvety tannins lend it a supple texture. Drink through 2021.
An old-school wine done really well. It starts with cherry, tobacco and light coconut aromas before moving on to juicy boysenberry and citrus flavors that are boosted by CUNE's trademark acids. Muscular, wiry and structured, but with restraints. Think Barry Bonds before Balco.
This combines Chardonnay, Malvasia Bianca, Sauvignon Blanc and Chenin Blanc in nearly equal parts. A sweet, floral nose of honeysuckle dominates before apricot jam and vanilla flavors enter the scene. Thick and concentrated, it finishes with a dry, crisp lemon note.
This wine is just over half Cabernet Sauvignon (55%), with the rest Merlot (20%), Malbec (15%) and Petit Verdot. Aromas of dark cherry meats, plum, herb and spice are followed by elegant fruit flavors backed by a firm grip of lightly dry tannins.
A blend of Syrah and Viognier, this red wine comes from one of Napa's coolest districts. It's a very good wine, dry and rich in tannins and balanced, with an elegant mouthfeel. Shows Syrah's flavors of blackberries, with a sprightly burst of citrusy acidity from Viognier. Drink now.
There's an interesting counterplay between the bright and the dark in Lovingston's hand-picked, small lot Josie's Knoll. On the nose, black cherry preserves are countered with black pepper spice and char. On the palate, ripe, concentrated black fruit is layered with tar, earth and bramble. It's elegant and seductive, but anchored by a core of gripping tannins.
Spicy, oaky and rich in flavor and texture, this wine tastes of vanilla, butter and ripe red cherries upon first sip, feels soft and easy on the palate. As it opens, more fruit and oaky spice flavors emerge, while firm tannins give it grip.
Quite light in color, this energetic blend of 76% Grenache and 24% Mourvèdre offers cinnamon stick, star anise, cola, raspberry and strawberry on the juicy and bright nose. The palate shows a lighter but juicy cranberry-fruit profile, with fennel, coriander and white pepper. It's a great, lighter style of red wine.
Leafy aromas of tomato and plum come with a blanket of coffee and mocha. This has a balanced mouthfeel and rooty, peppery, oaky flavors that outweigh the wine's fruit. A finish with flavors of plum, spice and pepper is fitting.
There's an exotic shadow of saffron and spice here, mingling sumptuously into honey and pressed apple flavors. It's delicately sweet and effortlessly juicy, but also savory and complex, finishing on a lingering, slightly bitter note. Drink now through 2019.
From Duckhorn, a very serious producer, but this is their fun wine. Not to say this blend of Zin, Cab, Merlot and Cab Franc isn't a heavyweight red. It is, with massive berry, cherry, chocolate and peppery spice flavors. But it seems designed for easier fare, such as barbecue. At its best over the next 5 years.
The full juiciness of Castelão is balanced by spice and structure from wood maturation. The result is a smooth, textured wine, firm with tannins for aging. It is rich, smoky, dry and edgy at this young stage. Drink from 2016.
Unctuous-textured wine, opulent, with impressively ripe fruit, this starts powerfully and continues that way. The big spicy dried fruits are right up front, with a dry core of tannins at the center. A fine, rounded wine, just freshened with some finishing acidity.
Only in Washington can you find pure varietal, single-vineyard Merlot at this price that shows such power and depth. Aged in American oak barrels with French oak stave inserts, it displays plenty of smoky caramel and coconut flavors, but the fruit is there in good proportion. This wine is sure to find plenty of admirers; if only more than just 58 cases had been produced.
While the notes of raspberry jam, plum and herbs bring plenty of appeal, it's the velvety soft, plush texture that truly dazzles on this fresh, fruit-filled wine that has a high yum factor.
This garnet colored Brunello opens with a tiny hint of bruised apple skin that gives the bouquet sudden lift or immediacy. Cherry fruit, leather and tobacco are backed by licorice and cola. In the mouth, the wine is toned with textured tannins.
This is a ripe, full wine with flavors of pineapple and apricots. Still developing, it still has a strongly mineral texture, so wait until 2018. This third-generation family estate hosts monthly musical and tasting events with estate fruit, vegetables and honey for sale.
Apple juice, pineapple and honey provide the central aromas, with a bit of citrus on the edges. It's lean and mean on the palate, with fresh apple and pear cider flavors picking up some lemon before showing off a greener, tarter, slightly unripe side.
You can think of this as a second label of Lancaster, the Cab producer whose estate vineyard the grapes come from. It's a pretty good Cab, strongly flavored and dry, with brisk tannins and a streak of herbs. The currant flavors taste a little overripe and raisiny.
From the Sant'Antimo appellation in southern Tuscany (near Montalcino), this zesty Pinot Grigio shows the richness and fullness you usually find in Tuscan whites. Generous tones of melon, yellow rose and apricot are followed by bright acidity.
Light in color, this affordable white is floral on the nose, with just a touch of reduction and heady smoky oak. Simply executed, it offers generous flavors of apple, pear and peach.
One of the more abundant New Zealand Pinot Noirs in the U.S., Brancott's 2007 Reserve boasts plenty of earthy, savory, sous-bois aromas and a bright cherry-cranberry core of flavor surrounded by foresty, fungal notes finishing crisp and long. Drink now–2013.
This shows classic Oakville tannins, acidity and rich blackberry and cassis flavors, with a nice, spicy finish. But, it doesn't show the flashy concentration or the ageworthiness of the region's best Cabernets. Give it a decanting and drink up.
A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec, this is a bold, concentrated and flavorful wine that will mature well over the next 10 years. Aromas of espresso, crème de cassis, spiced blackberry, boysenberry preserves, tobacco and woodspice abound and carry through to the robust, gripping palate. It's firmly structured, but harmonious in it's overall strength, with final notes of campfire, char and cocoa on the long finish.
Here is a rich and dense style of Brunello with bright berry tones and ripe cherry followed by cedar, cola and spice. The wine is rich and opulent in the mouth with great intensity, soft tannins and well integrated acidity. La Mannella really steps forward in terms of quality with this vintage.
Ripe yellow-peach and delicate red-berry hints lend a juicy, easygoing fruitiness to this concentrated Riesling. Soft, pink-grapefruit-like acidity and a flash of green herb add freshness to the finish.
Here's a country-style wine, rough and ready for consumption. It's rugged in texture, with jagged tannins framing superripe berry flavors leading to a finish that's almost sweet in raisins.
Rich in well-ripened fruit flavors and with a sweet coat of smoky oak and vanilla, this Chard also has a structural integrity based on crispness and vitality. It's not a soft, creamy Chard, but a firm one, with exotic fruit.
Aromas of oak, black plum, coconut and roasted coffee beans lead the nose on this full-bodied red. The big, chewy palate offers black cherry, blackberry jam, vanilla and coffee framed in round tannins. A licorice note backs up the finish.
Ripe black cherries get aromatic lift from sagebrush and thyme on this wine that Doug Margerum makes from the fruit of his friend, Reo Reiswig. There is an immediate zing of acidity, with red and purple fruit flavors that bounce between raspberry and blueberry while also picking up mocha, herbs and leather along the way. A very dynamic wine.
This is a lush, soft, ripe Cabernet. Its main feature is fruit, and plenty of it. It is full of blackberries, cherries, currants and plums, edged with sweet oak. Drink now.
Made entirely from Sangiovese, this enjoyable wine opens with violet and Mediterranean herb aromas. The straightforward palate doles out wild cherry flavors, an earthy hint of underbrush and soft tannins. Enjoy soon.
A young Zin still in need of time to develop, there's an intensity of raspberry and blackberry fruit in this wine, and a softness throughout. It's full bodied, and its finish falls flat.
Clean and proper, if a bit soft and simple. Shows modest cherry-berry flavors with a touch of oak.
This is a blend of 85% Pinot Noir and 15% Lemberger—and yet the Lemberger is the dominant grape. The color is dark, the aromas and flavors are chunky and less nuanced than pure Pinot Noir, and the tannins are ripe but lack the silky character of Pinot. It's a solid, robust red that would make a nice match for burgers and the like.
Overripe and Port-like, this has chocolate, raisin and blackberry jam flavors. It's rich, and it has a prickly heat that comes from the high alcohol.
Light white peppery aromas usher in peppery plum fruit on the palate. Has a nice, sturdy feel in the mouth, and firm tannins on the finish. A 60-20-20% blend of Grenache, Tempranillo and Shiraz.
The white Reserva from Esporão is full-bodied, with a judicious mix of softness and toasty creaminess. There's a great touch of lime to freshen it all up, as well as spice to go with the wood. Aging potential for the next 2–3 years.
Earthy and just the slightest touch reduced, this is a feral, juicy and intriguing wine from the well-known site, complex and medium to almost light-bodied in texture and approach. Cherry and pomegranate compote meet cardamom baking spices to suggest warmth and comfort in a glass.
A respectable effort, this offers attractive aromas of fig, melon and nectarine, but doesn't follow through with much intensity on the palate. It's light to medium in body, with hints of citrus pith and a bit of bitterness on the finish.
The delicate aromas that characterize this ripasso are quite extraordinary considering the harsh tactics of appassimento and double fermentation used to make this wine. The wine maintains an elegant and distinguished personality on the nose with bright berries and spice.
This wine has a severity of sour cherry and yeasty baked bread on both the nose and palate, showing a lightness of touch in terms of ripeness and oak. It's simple and bright.
Gorgeous color and concentration with brilliant ruby highlights make this a beautiful wine to contemplate in the glass. The aromas are broad and far-reaching with a high mineral component, small berry fruit, spice and a distinct soapy-lavender element. Chewy, firm and succulent, it's a mouth-watering bruiser that leaves a lasting imprint on the palate. Only 60 cases made.
Good structure on this 100% Sauvignon Blanc, with crisp acidity and even some nice, dusty tannins. But the pineapple, Meyer lemon and lime flavors are too sugary sweet for a dry table wine.
There is no denying the richness and concentration of this very full-bodied, intensely fruity, smooth-textured and sweet-seeming wine. Made from equal parts Zinfandel and Petite Sirah, it smells and tastes like chocolate and black cherries so ripe they're starting to shrivel, and has a touch of balsamic on the boysenberry-like finish.
Lots of juicy fruit and zesty acidity in this wine. It's PGs like this that are driving the variety in America. Apples, nectarines, peaches, peppery spices and wildflowers all mingle into a fruity, slightly sweet finish.
Some charred almond or toast aromas join with black berry and crushed granite in this full and generous wine. Nice linear quality allows the berry fruit to glide over a long smooth finish. Good structure and intensity but not overdone.
Half Viognier with the rest equal parts Marsanne and Roussanne, it's aromatically expressive with notes of lime zest, honeysuckle, almond and white peach. The palate is flavorful yet delicate, showing an exquisite sense of balance that carries through the lingering finish. It's subtle but if you pick up its nuances, there are plenty to find.
This frankly sweet sparkler smells like toasted almonds and pistachios, and tastes rich, round, floral and nutty. It has a good, fine bead, nice balance from the wine's acidity, and feels smooth and broad in texture.
The aromas of herb, citrus and melon rind are light. The palate drinks dry, with the concentration seeming a bit lacking.
Soft layers of faint lemon, fig and yellow apple stand out in this pretty, straightforward and slightly tart white, the whole of the palate lingering in long-lasting minerality. A versatile food wine, it offers a lot of elegance.
Tough and gritty in tannins, this Cabernet is still raw. There's a flattering core of ripe blackberry and black currant fruits, but the wine doesn't show the approachability of other 2007 Cabernets. Give it another five years in the cellar, but no guarantees that the fruit will outlast the tannins.
L'Ecole's Walla Walla Cabernet has a soft-focus silkiness, an almost gauzy character. Behind that film is a wine tasting of wild berries, Bing cherries and fresh herbs, with light streaks of coffee and moist earth. Give this one plenty of decanting and the scrim lifts away and reveals a firm, beautifully balanced and nuanced wine.
Pinched smelling at first, with a note of turpentine. Airing eliminates that burn, leaving standard nut and vanilla aromas. Feels good and lively, with refreshing acidity and nutty, dry flavors of white fruits including peach and apricot. Finishes long and fresh.
A minty, modern style of wine that also has too much extraction and wood tannin for its own good. It's hard edged, the fruit losing out in the process.
Lots of bang for the buck here. Offers mouth-filling, juicy blackberry, cherry, pomegranate and coffee flavors in a bone-dry, soft wine, with a fairly complicated tannin structure. Drink now.
For the price, this is a commendable effort, with scents of toast and vanilla layered over modest cherry fruit. The wine is medium bodied and marked by the a fine, soft texture, then finishes on a tart note.
There is 8g/L of residual sugar, so some tasters might object to a hint of sweetness, but others will just find it helps to accentuate the wine's fruit-forward nature. Pear and fig flavors pick up some honeyed stone fruit notes on the palate but this is nicely balanced and easy to drink.
This blend of Tempranillo, Syrah and other varieties is medium to full bodied, nicely tannic and firm in texture. Bold in flavor, it tastes complete and well crafted without being too showy. The balance is dry and the flavors resemble cranberry and ripe cherry.
Intense aromas of Golden Delicious apple, freshly baked bread, peppermint and apricot are generous and bright. There's a slight note of volatility here but it contributes happily to the overall complexity of the bouquet and is balanced by warmer, baked aromas of spice and yellow fruit.
Always more precocious than Kumeu River's Maté's Vineyard Chardonnay, this bottling nevertheless seems to be moving in a tighter, more restrained direction. The citrus and pineapple flavors are reined in by structure, finishing lean and citrusy, with just enough peach to provide flesh. Drink now–2012.
Touches of vanilla and caramel give this wine an extra dimension of richness. It is full while remaining crisp and herbaceous, with a lively, bright aftertaste. Drink from 2016. The Richard family's two-acre Sauvignon Blanc vineyard is certified organic.
Scented with green gooseberry aromas, this 100% Sauvignon Blanc isn't for everyone. It's enriched by citrus and peach fruit, and by creamy lees and a touch of oak.
Way too ripe and soft for balance, this Cab is almost Porty. It has simple, sugary flavors of blackberry and cherry pastries.
Savory and smoky notes arise on the nose of this bottling that also offers rust, dark red cherries and a juniper-anise twist. Dried cherries and blueberries mix with oregano and thyme on the palate, which is mostly fruit driven.
This was a very good vintage for Goldeneye, the best since '01. The fruit got ripe, offering up a big mouthful of jammy cherry and raspberry flavors accented with sweet oak. The tannin-acid balance is just great. It's delicious, yet has all kinds of complex edges and nuances.
This is a big, ripe, fruity Syrah, but it has an underlying balance and finesse that give it first-class status. It's a well-oaked, dry wine, with  thick but smooth tannins that frame intense blackberry, mulberry and cocoa flavors. Best enjoyed in its youth.
Raw and resiny, with no peg for you to hang your hat on. The palate is sharp and short on ripeness, while the finish settles on hot. Just an aggressive wine with little polish. Not worth the price.
Very good price for a Cab of this quality. It's dry and full-bodied, with ripe, attractive flavors of blackberry jam, cherries, minty chocolate and smoky oak.
This wine is dense and severely tannic. It has dense ripe-fruit flavors as well, although they are buried under the power of the structure. For a wine of such impressive character that is not a bad thing, it just indicates that it needs time to mature and will age well. Drink from 2023.
This Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend is big, burly and very young, showing some rough aromas of burnt rubber or asphalt at first, but later evolving to reveal firm black-cherry fruit and licorice. The weight of the wine shows admirable extraction and richness, and the powdery tannins hint at a long and positive evolution.
Sun-ripened apricots and yellow flowers perfume this lush, richly textured Chardonnay. It's fresh and primary in sunny tangerine and stone fruit flavors, yet deep and penetrating on the palate. It finishes long, with a chalky, briny, mineral tone.
A bit sharp, but polished and supple, with good varietal flavors of blackberries, currants, tobacco and a hint of heady crême de cassis liqueur. Seems at its best now, so drink up.
One-quarter of the Clos des Maréchaudes is classified Grand Cru, as the soil and the slope change. This shows in the power of the wine with its smoky tannins and dark character. Black fruits and a dense texture signify a wine with power and longevity. Drink from 2022.
Quince and lychee fruit flavors dominate this ripe, off-dry wine. It has a spicy character, allowing for a dry core of pepper while also giving a rich aftertaste. Drink now.
This is a walk backward after the impressive 2012. Almost impenetrably black, the flavors converge around espresso and bitter chocolate, yet the tannins have a green edge. The wine simply feels flat in the mouth with no life to it.
A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (52%), Syrah (24%), Merlot (19%) and Malbec, this appealing single-vineyard wine suggests vanilla, freshly ground coffee, dark fruit and spices. It's sweet and richly flavored, with a firm squeeze of tannins.
Dusty and still fairly fresh, but with that said this wine was certainly more in its prime six or eight months ago. Now it is slick but softening, with peach and citrus flavors doing their thing without much edge or kick.
Here is a simple and one-dimensional Prosecco that doles out citrus and honey. Try it with salted finger foods.
A strong blast of tire rubber dominates the nose. In the mouth, this wine feels narrow and tannic. Dark berry flavors are almost burnt tasting and come with a note of dark chocolate, leading to a charred finish.
Ripe fruits, very smooth and polished, are primarily of a juicy black currant character over sweet ripe tannins. Great swathes of fruit finish this solid wine.
This wine pushes the envelope on concentration and ripeness. It's full of prune, raisin and licorice on the nose, but also a lot of weight. It's quite jammy and soft by Priorat standards, as intense blackberry and molten fudge flavors take over. Chewy, warm and ready to drink.
A bright, fresh wine, its red currant and fresh plum acidity an important element. It has dry tannins at the core, giving a firm structure and hints of wood, with sweeter fruit coming through to finish.
Fairly earthy and a touch sulfuric at first, but in due time this Pinot rounds out. The body and attitude are full and forward, while the medium-to-full palate shows nice raspberry, dry plum and spice flavors. Ripe and clean for the most part, with some chocolate and mocha on the finish.
This has ripe red fruits, with a fine line of acidity cutting through its rich texture. It is full and fruity, and the tannins act as good support for the forward fruit flavors.
Mellow Golden Delicious fruit is tempered by bright, lemony acidity that shines a light on more subtle notes of orange flesh and tangerine. The mouthfeel and the lingering edges are shot through with an almost textural zestiness. This is lovely, fruit-driven, bright and dry.
A very good followup to the excellent '02, the '03 is plush and ripe and ageable. With forward cherry, blackberry, cassis and chocolate flavors, it offers plenty of opulence now, but has the tannic backbone to peak and then gradually fade for 10 years. Signorello's estate Cab is really one of the more dependable bottlings in the valley.
This wine's golden apple, yellow pear and beeswax aromas carry over to the bright, straightforward palate, along with a hint of citrus. It has a clean, fresh finish.
This big, hearty, full-bodied wine was made from 75% Zinfandel. It has spicy, oaky aromas, generous dark plum and cherry flavors and plenty of grip from tannins and acidity to wrap around all that flavor. It feels quite full bodied, dense but smooth in texture, and well-balanced for a wine with this much concentration.
Distinctive for its understated, honest expression, the 2005 Hill of Content Cabernet Sauvignon offers up classic blackberry fruit accented with green pepper notes. The palate shows laser-like acidity, springy tannins and winds up with generous sweet fruit. A solid, sophisticated wine. Try with grilled steak. Drinking well now but will improve over the next several years.
This is a dry wine, very spicy, with a tight, taut texture and strongly mineral character layered with citrus as well as pepper. It's a food wine with its almost crisp aftertaste.
A gamy accent adds depth to the blackberry-driven bouquet of this wine. Additional hints of curing spice, pepper, licorice root and charred cedar unfold on the palate and linger through to the medium-length close. It's firmly structured yet balanced, with medium acidity and gripping tannins.
Organically grown grapes give this wine a pure and fruity character that makes it instantly attractive. It is crisp, laced with lemon and lively, juicy red fruits. The aftertaste is dry and full of flavor.
I very much like and admire this wine for many reasons, but primarily because it doesn't taste like any other wine. There's black cherry fruit at the center, with currant, olive and earthy flavors. It's a sizeable, though not overdone, wine with a nice chalk-clay texture, and aromas of eucalyptus, earth and cool-climate fruit. Only in its second vintage but already consistently good.
A strongly herbal, garrigue character dominates the overall personality of this wine, but is supported by ample black plum and cherry notes to keep it from being overly earthy or green. Firm, slightly astringent tannins coat the palate and remain well into the finish.
Justice is a wine for those who like their reds big, bold and super rich. It's a full-on palate blaster that keeps its balance with moderate acidity and a generous (60%) amount of new French oak. Syrah-dominated, with 21% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Merlot, it's a fine steakhouse wine that should be consumed now.
Full bodied and richly textured, this wine stood out in a flight of southern Rhônes for its obvious oak. It's a toasty, cedary, vanilla-laden wine, but with enough fruit weight to support the wood. Drink it now if you like that style, or give it a few years' in the cellar and see if the fruit emerges over time.
Light herbal aromas and lively grapefruit flavors make this inexpensive wine true to type and fun to drink. It is nicely dry and has good, crisp acidity.
Ramione is a very satisfying wine that shows a rich, fleshy consistency and loads of mature berry and pulpy fruit. A blend of Nero d'Avola and Merlot, the wine offers background aromas of smoked bacon and tar.
A rich concentration of honey and botrytis gives this wine balanced sweetness. Full bodied and ripe, this has a spice character that is well contained with serious flavors of mineral and almond.
Fragrant and elegantly structured, this blend of Sangiovese and 10% Canaiolo and Colorino opens with lovely aromas of pressed violet, iris, perfumed berry and baking spice. On the palate, notes of white pepper, toast, espresso and anise accent the black cherry core. Tightly knit but polished tannins give it a firm finish. Drink 2016–2022.
Rich aromas of milk chocolate share space on the nose with mushroom, cherry and currant notes. Although this ranks as a fuller-bodied Pinot, the palate retains a sense of crispness courtesy of bright acidity. Flavors of tomato, herbs, black plum and spice are just oaky enough, while this finishes with a blend of barrel notes, cherry and plum. Drink through 2020.
Every year this wine seems to get better. This vintage deals notes of lemon pie, melon and lychee on the bouquet, which is followed by a palate that's oily yet racy. Flavors of lychee and pineapple are true to Torrontés, while green herb and lime notes stir things up.
This ripe, rounded and fruity wine hails from vineyards at the western end of the Marne Valley. Its yellow fruit and soft apple flavors are only lightly marked by minerality. The acidity is fragrant, refreshing and with just the right crispness to balance all this soft fruit.
What a great Pinot Gris. Barrel-fermented, it shows a toasty, creamy smokiness to the citrus, nectarine, fig and vanilla flavors, with that Edna Valley acidity that's so clean and refreshing. Absolutely delicious, it's rich and substantial enough to stand in as an interesting alternative to Chardonnay.
This is ripe, full in the mouth and rich. It has intense strawberry fruits, a touch of sweetness and fragrant, fresh acidity. It's a wine to drink now.
Coteaux Varois is a small region that gives lively, gentle wine such as this delicious rosé. It's pink in color, ripe, touched by caramel and with a rounded, soft aftertaste.
There are some rich cherry and raspberry granola flavors in this wine, but it's tired. It lacks the vibrancy to give it life and structure. Drink up.
This is all fruit and no structure. The fruit shows a superripe character, which suggests this is a wine for short-term aging.
A very light, delicate style that some might relate to the German Pinots. The low-alcohol, high-acid style accents thin varietal flavors with scents of rose petal soap and vanilla.
This wears its 16.5% alcohol well, like a heavy but graceful dancer. It's softly sweet in glycerine, with flavors of milk chocolate and blackberry jam, sprinkled with black pepper and anisette liqueur.
Ripe and smooth, with hints of molasses, toast, and vanilla as well as mulberry and blackberry. The wine runs sweet but masculine, with chocolate as the prime secondary flavor. Finishes long and broad, with supple tannins. Made from 8-year-old vines. Drink now through 2015.
Rogue Valley Cabernet Sauvignon has yet to carve out any sort of reputation for itself, and has been prone to herbaceous, even vegetal fruit with aggressively rough tannins. Winemaker Jonathan Oberlander has gone a ways toward taming them, rounding out the fruit, and crafting a complete and satisfying wine. Its best feature is the nose, complex, varietal and tightly laced. The mix of dried herb, black olive, smoke and cassis fills in the midpalate with Bordeaux-like authority.
A common thread among the 2015 Soléna Pinots is a stiff herbal beet flavor rather than fully ripe berry fruit. This tilts into cranberry and very tart raspberry, but finishes astringent and hard. Give it plenty of decanting (two or three hours) to help it open up.
Ripe blackberry, dark cherry, prune, mocha, oak, grilled sage and vanilla sensations come together on this soft and accessible wine. Ripe, round tannins provide the framework for the juicy palate. Enjoy through 2016.
This blend of 72% Cabernet Sauvignon, 24% Syrah and 4% Cabernet Franc shows smashed blueberries and blackcurrant on the nose alongside dried dill, pencil lead, cola and beef char. The palate is frame by judicious acidity and strong graphite flavors, with bright cherry and tart dark cranberry fruit, lifted by smoke and black pepper.
With its light touch and fresh acidity over the delicate honey flavors, this is an immediately delicious dessert wine that doesn't dominate by knock-out richness, but by its finesse. Acidity goes hand in hand with the ripe pineapple and peach flavors. Worth aging, maybe 4–5 years. Glass stopper.
Round and ripe, with a touch of rich prune and warm earth on the spice-cabinet nose. Fairly oaky, with coconut and raspberry flavors. That coconutty character sticks with it through the finish, which is slightly tannic.
Aromas of violet, rose and woodland berry emerge on this fragrant wine. Made solely with the Sorbara grape and refermented in the bottle, the vibrant palate offers woodland berry, cherry, nectarine zest and a hint of crystallized ginger alongside firm acidity and a frothy mousse.
This especially ripe and deep style of Barbera grown at the Miraflores property looks quite dark, smells like dried fruit and tastes rich and full-bodied. It has admirable concentration, a smooth and layered texture and good length on the finish.
This four-variety blend starts off a little sulfury and nutty, but blossoms with time in the glass into a light, citrusy mouthful of wine filled with hints of white nectarines and minerals. Finishes long, clean and refreshing.
A big, grapey bad boy with super richness but not much refinement or elegance. If size matters to you, then this may be your buddy. It's full of ribald boysenberry and cassis, and the feel is gritty and big. But it's short on touch, and overall it's more of an old-vines fruit bomb than a crafted, precise wine.
There's something rustic and spicy and earthy about Dry Creek Chardonnays, but Ed Sbragia manages to lift this wine into opulence. It's pretty oaky, yet the vanilla and honey flavors marry perfectly with the pineapple and pear fruit to produce a wine of great attraction.
There is something subliminally medicinal about these aromas—the ethereal lift of herbal tinctures alloyed with dark plum and a generous dash of white pepper. This is not for beginners looking for easy fruit notes, but rather for those who like to converse with their wine. This layered, compelling and balanced glassful will provide food for thought with its finely structured tannins, medium body and bundles of flavor.
Serious and huge, but talk about a ton of oak: this has a ton and a half, yielding sawdust-based aromas along with creamy plum notes. The thing is, once you realize that you're all-in with the wood, it tastes good, feels good and finishes good. A 3M wine: mint, molasses and medicine. But in this style it's done well.
This is the first release from the newly-planted estate vineyard, located further up Red Mountain on rock-strewn soil. Resulting in juice remarkable for such young vines that's showing tight wild berry flavors and a firm base of mineral and chalk.
This Colchagua Petit Verdot, something you don't see much of, is huge and saturated. Woody, spicy aromas include scents of chocolate but also pinched rubber and olive. Black-fruit flavors are herbal and give way to char, toast and chocolate notes, while heavy tannins take over on the finish.
A great value in ready-to-drink, savory, complex Shiraz, the 2009 Cliff Edge boasts plenty of smoky, bacony notes, which add a Rhône-like edge to the blueberry and plum fruit. Black olives chime in, adding even more savory complexity, while the tannins are silky. Drink now–2020.
Initially a rather subdued Frog; as if it has been tamed down. Then, suddenly, There's a plush core of blackberry fruit, and the classic Cayuse funkiness is there, drenched in liquid rocks and cured meat and drying tannins. It's all in proportion and a fine reflection of the steely vintage. As it opens gracefully you discover that it is a stunningly refined Frog, quite possibly the best ever; powerful and distinctive, but also elegant, feminine.
Distinguished in its texture, this Syrah boasts smooth, complex tannins and a bright burst of acidity, which provides the framework for rich flavors of blackberries, plums, bacon and spices. Drink soon for its youthful vigor.
Very ripe, showing rich, pure varietal flavors of blackberries, cherries, ground pepper, grilled meat, sweet sandalwood and spices. One hundred percent Syrah, it's balanced with great acidity. Really smooth and delicious, and a crowd pleaser. Could develop over the next 4–5 years.
Lush and fruity, this has a raisiny, cooked prune quality to its fruit. It's sweet and roasted, easy-going, and fits in neatly with the winery's lineup of ripe, soft reds. But it could be almost anything in that lineup; it doesn't have any of the particular character that makes Washington Syrah so distinctive.
Bring on the BBQ and don't worry about analyzing this lusty red wine. It's full-bodied and dry, and blasts off in the mouth with explosive blackberries, currants, mulberries, leather, mocha, violets and spices. Super-easy to drink, and to like.
Honey, melon, pineapple, apricot and vanilla are all prominent players on the nose of this offering. The fruit was obviously picked very ripe; add to that a caramel-vanilla suggestion of sweetness from American oak and the overall impression is almost of a dessert wine, without the sugar.
This is an honest wine, with an herbal aroma and notes of tomato and red plum. It feels zingy due to tomato-like acidity, with red fruit flavors followed by a lean finish.
Made in a completely different style from Uvaggio's typical Primitivo, this is meant to be a reserve-tier bottling, with seven months in new and once-used oak. Crisp berry flavor, along with a hint of cranberry, makes this juicy and balanced. It finishes softly on a slightly nutty note.
Tropical fruit mixed with fairly heavy oak is the theme here. The nose offers melon, pineapple and butter, while the palate is fat and creamy, with plenty of vanilla. Finishes with a lot of wood and just enough acid to keep things balanced. Imported by Palm Bay Imports.
The nose is heady and fragrant, edged with dried chamomile and hay flowers and subdued honey. Underneath that is a notion of sweet, luscious apricot compote. With time, there are the most subtle notes of enticing pine resin and fir honey—lit and illuminated all the way by the purest and most concentrated of lemon acidity. A triumph of balance and richness.
Riverbend vineyard—the estate vineyard for Fielding Hills—is the fruit source. Also in the blend are Cabernet Sauvignon (12%) and Cabernet Franc (10%). Berries, cassis, coffee liqueur, vanilla and coconut flavors combine in a tasty and substantial take on Merlot. This is especially rich in barrel flavors for this price.
This is already drying out, its fruit fading and its mouthfeel turning a bit woody. There's a trace of of tart berry fruit, with plenty of drying tannins. Drink now.

Extremely elegant and restrained at first on the nose, this bottling eventually shows gravel and crushed rocks, with hints of blackberry and forest underbrush also emerging. A very firm structure weaves together an incredibly well-integrated wine, with dense mulberry and dried-fennel notes that morph into crushed herbs with time. Drink 2018–2032.
This is already mature. It has weight and demonstrates a delicious balance between a ripe white-fruit flavor and fresh acidity, with a fine note of tangy citrus. Ready to drink.
This is an attractively perfumed dry Muscat. Very floral, deliciously decadent in its richness, it has a crisp bite of spice and pepper. Drink the wine from 2017.
Pio Cesare's Barbera is a modern interpretation of a traditional grape, and a well-done one at that. Refined notes of mocha, cinnamon and vanilla vie with vibrant strawberry fruit while lively acidity lifts and supports the wine. Coffee notes dominate the perfumed, medium-length finish.

This shows the creamy texture of Chardonnay, but with exotic flavors of tropical fruit, sweet nut and pear butter.
Tart, citrusy acidity backs up cranberry, pomegranate and spice flavors in this dry, silky young Pinot Noir. It's somewhat brusque right out of the bottle, so give it a brief decant before pouring.
Still quite young yet unmistakably lush, this bottling immediately shows fresh apples, white peach and plenty of new oak from 100% barrel fermentation. The lip-smacking acidity keeps fruit and oak in balance; all that is needed is a bit more bottle age. Decant it if you plan to drink it immediately.
Fragrant in game, lavender, herb and red berry fruit, Terre Rouge's only California appellation Syrah is dusty, savory and reasonably light, approachable from beginning to end. On the finish, enjoy handfuls of peppery spice.
The distinct and alluring scents of dried, salted apricot take the lead in this blend of Viognier, Rousanne and Marsanne. Once sipped, it's slightly less viscous than other Rhône whites of this vintage, but a bit more savory and very well balanced in its honeyed flavors. Serve with chicken enchiladas or chile verde.
Shows softness, perhaps missing a big structure. To compensate there is a great red fruit element that dominates the tannins. Juicy and fruity, layered acidity to finish.

A beautiful wine that will be best from 2013–2016.

Duca San Felice Riserva is an historic wine that highlights the potential of winemaking in Calabria (the toe of the boot of Italy) and its native Gaglioppo grape. There's elegance here in the wine's ruby color and bright berry nuance. But there's also power in terms of the wine's intensity and length.
Full-bodied flavors of tropical fruits give this wine richness and ripeness. It is simple, straightforward with immediately attractive depth of flavor. No complexity here.

Cabernet specialist Laird turns their hand to Pinot, with mixed results. The wine is a little heavy, showing extracted cherry jam, raspberry Newton, rum punch and brown sugar flavors. It's tasty, but lacks the complex vitality and elusiveness.
Roughly half and half Stermer Vineyard and Meyer Vineyard fruit is selected for this reserve blend. It's a deep-diving wine that pushes precise flavors of black cherry, licorice, vanilla and espresso front and center. A hint of truffle comes up in the finish, and the overall structure and balance are spot-on. You could cellar this for a few more years, but it's already drinking very nicely, so why wait?
Highly juicy wine, packed with tannins as well as black currants and red berries. Green pepper, spice and high acidity are strongly present.
An opening of dried leaves, spice and berry fruit is pretty good and authentic, while the palate feel seems right given the wine's price and structure. Flavors of cherry, raspberry and plum are roasted and mildly herbal but come with proper feel and follow through. Good for under $10.
Opening with subtle aromas that recall white flower and citrus, this straightforward white offers flavors of Granny Smith apple and lime alongside bright acidity. It's extremely simple but also clean and refreshing.

This is a fine wine, with wood and fruit both rich and concentrated. It has spice, juicy black fruits and ripe tannins. It is developing slowly and surely and will be ready to drink from 2019.
Almost tropical overtones on the nose announce ample pure fruit. Russet pear has both a touch of fresh Amalfi lemon and luscious honey. Yet the palate is slender, taut and dry. A lovely evocation of the varietal richness of Pinot Gris, framed on very light feet with elegance and poise. Totally appetizing, dry and moreish.
As easy and tasty as a summer wine gets, this blush also has a lovely coppery-pink color. Flavors of fresh strawberries and spice burst on the palate, and drink just a tad off-dry.
Pale blush on the glass, this Rhône-style blend has a pleasing bouquet of strawberry and lavender. It is very refreshing, with flavors of strawberry, honeysuckle, orange blossom and watermelon. There is a light sense of coolness towards the finish, but bright citrus notes outlast that sensation.
This opens with delicate aromas reminiscent of white spring flower and a whiff of orchard fruit. On the palate, fresh acidity underscores creamy Bartlett pear and nectarine zest that lead to a clean, bright finish.
Although this is marked nonvintage, the fruit all comes from 2004. It is made from old vines, giving richness and ripeness, and a generous white fruit character which fully compensates for the very dry nature of the wine. It's delicious, a complex wine of intense character.
So ripe and sweet in raspberries, cherries and blueberries, it's practically like pie filling, except this Pinot manages to finish dry. You have to give it credit for sheer razzle-dazzle.
While five years from harvest, this bold, penetrating Merlot is still a baby, with a long, promising future ahead. Subtle whiffs of crisp red cherry and mushroom seem quiet on the nose, but the palate is deeply concentrated. Black plum and cherry flavors are penetrating yet deftly grounded by a core of mouth puckering tannin and acidity. Enjoy starting 2020, but should maintain for much longer.
A surprise and a true find in that this wine is excellent but priced well below its quality level. The nose is outright gorgeous; it's subtle, spicy, layered with dried fruit and folds in hints of tomato leaf and dill. The palate is expressive, delicate and offers smooth, leathery flavors. In a perfect state of evolution; drink now through 2013.
A traditional style of Rioja with earthy, peppery, dry aromas in front of a healthy, lively palate. Tastes like vanilla and buttery oak on top of zesty but restrained raspberry and red plum. Shows spice, character and a wholeness that makes it a winner. Drink now through 2015.
This is the third separate cuvée of Grüner Veltliner from Reustle, and given the name (which means emerald), it's clearly meant to be modeled after the Austrian style. For those who relish a crisp, mineral-driven wine, with ripe fruit flavors of Meyer lemon, green apple and pink grapefruit, this rings all those bells and more. The length and definition are most impressive.
With a collection of apple blossom, acacia, peach and flint aromas, this fairly full-bodied Albariño offers a mix of plumpness and alluring flavors, namely nectarine, apple and white peach. Complex notes of sea brine, minerality and saline propel a sophisticated finish. Drink through summer 2016.
Fat wine, with yellow fruits, a full-bodied texture and only light acidity. It feels heavy in the mouth.
Smells and tastes hot and cooked, as if some of the grapes shriveled on the vine and weren't properly sorted out. Otherwise, you'll find flavors of blackberry jam and dry Port.
Black cherry to the eye, this wine has a bouquet of raspberry and Mediterranean herbs with a strong note of lavender. It is well-crafted, with flavors of cherry, blackberry, smoked meat, thyme and black pepper. Silky tannins line the palate, and the finish offers a burst of cranberry and pomegranate.

Fresh tropical aromas of lychee, mango, honeydew and orange blossom show on the nose. These notes carry to the palate and mix with an herbaceous quality. Soft and round in mouthfeel, this Vidal ends on a savory note.
This Demeter-certified biodynamic wine is made in an immediately enjoyable, drink-now style. Brandied black cherries and sun-baked earth mark the nose, while the palate is full, creamy and plush. It's warm, ripe and welcoming from start to finish.
Evident notes of beef broth, red beet and natural rubber come forth, making it difficult to identify the wine's natural fruit. The wine has a thick, succulent feel with chewy, sour tannins.

This La Clape red, made from 50% Grenache, 40% Syrah and 10% Mourvèdre, is dark and herbal, with strong aromas of black berries and plum guts supporting the garrigue notes of lavender, thyme and bay leaf. More dark fruit unfolds in the mouth alongside sweet cigar spice and notes of bittersweet chocolate, almost like a spiced Black Forest cake. Big and hedonistic but silky and balanced; drink now–2014.
This perfumed wine offers plenty (perhaps too much) acidity and red fruits, with only light tannins. That makes for a fruity wine, fresh and ready to drink now and until 2018.
Interesting floral, herb, cherry and chocolate-mint aromas are a good preview of the racy black cherry and berry flavors that rule the palate. The acidity is a bit pointed, giving the wine an edgy feel. But with elevated flavors as well as cola and chocolate on the finish it comes across nice and ready to drink.

One of the grandest single vineyards in Champagne, an immensely steep south-facing hillside that dominates Mareuil-sur-Aÿ. From here, Philipponnat is able to produce powerful wines with toasty, ripe fruit, powered with yeast and flavors of hazelnuts and white fruits. While not as tense and without the aging potential of 1998, this is without doubt a great Champagne.
Grapefruit, strawberry and roses lead on the nose of this friendly pour. Cherry and flowers on the palate are playful and easy drinking. A great patio pour with a fun character.
Here's a robust, sinfully rich Zinfandel that's bursting at the seams with flavor. Explodes in the mouth with blackberries, cherries, black raspberries, chocolate, licorice, butterscotch and pepper. But it's no mere fruit bomb, with beautiful acids and tannins providing structure. Drink now.
Brambly and baked on the nose, with crusty black fruit aromas and vanilla accents. The palate has a clacky feel and comes up lean in the middle, with herbal red berry and light, leafy flavors. Finishes dry, with a tobacco note.
Burnt and seemingly weedy at first, this heavily oaked 100% Garnacha is initially downright weird and baked. In the final analysis it's all wood and medicinal fruit. Not a personal favorite.
This wine's floral aromas, complete with hints of apricot, citrus and spice, are fine, and the palate delivers a cornucopia of fruit, but despite this wine's ample spritz, it comes across as a bit heavy and sweet.
This is a ripe and tropical wine, complex with wood aging. It is warm, intensely rich and piled with mango and pineapple flavors. The acidity and crispness are well behind this smooth, creamy wine. Drink from 2022.
Raisin cake and dried cherry are highlighted in this fairly light expression of what can otherwise be a hearty variety, buoyed by a brightness of acidity. Vanilla and plum add to the mix, as soft, supple tannins support the weight and breadth of an approachable wine.
Winemaker: Etienne le Riche. There are layers of aromas and flavors in this complex wine, starting with attractive scents of pressed purple flowers, wild strawberries, blackberries and woodspice. The palate is seriously spicy, but grounded by dense—yet not overdone—black fruit flavors. Medium acidity and structured tannins, followed by a long, evolving finish, complete the package. Harmonious, well integrated and balanced, drink 2020–2024.

The palate delivers layers of juicy black cherry, blackberry, raspberry, white pepper and clove alongside youthfully assertive but ripe tannins. Drink 2017–2030.
A little weedy, despite lots of flashy oak. The pineapples and peaches have notes of dried dill and thyme, and the finish is dry and crisp. Nice with broiled halibut in a thyme-butter sauce.
This pale, clean wine shimmers like a diamond in the glass. The nose is a shape-shifter, jumping from tropical elements of honeydew, bubble gum and guava to sharper-cut grass tones. It's dynamic on the palate too, proving both ripe with stone-fruit flesh and sour with chopped herbs, green pepper and grass. A touch of crushed rocks rounds it out nicely.
There's a streak of rose petal amidst soft red and blue fruit in this Zinfandel. The tannins are soft, and there's not much to offer in terms of spice or concentrated flavors.
Grenache's main duty is to deliver cherry flavors, and this one over-performs in that category. It just brims with black and red cherries in their essence. The wine is dry and silky, even more light-bodied than some Pinot Noirs, and quite delicious in its own way. Drink now with a grilled steak and rosemary potatoes.

This is a full-bodied, creamy-textured wine that I would opt to drink over the next few years.
Bold and full of berry and plum aromas. The palate is a touch short of refined but it features nice cherry, cassis and blackberry flavors. Plush in the mouth and on the finish, with tannins to spare. At its center it shows the slightest hint of green. Imported by Sovereign Wine Imports.

Williams  Selyem's track record with this bottling is excellent. While this 2012 has notes of raisins, they're more of a seasoning than the main ingredient. It's a robust, lusty wine, filled with blackberries, dark chocolate, anise and pepper, yet balanced. It will age through 2024.

Delicate but enticing aromas of white peach and wisteria float from the glass. The lively, linear palate shows Granny Smith apple, Kaiser pear, citrus zest and a ginger note alongside crisp—almost crackling—acidity.
Black fruit up front has an earthy, composty quality; the palate's mixed berries take a back seat to wood. Persistent herb and white-pepper flavors on the finish persist longer than I wanted them to. A rustic, rough-around-the-edges wine that begs for stew or black beans.
The grandest of all white Burgundy vineyards, Montrachet has produced a powerful, great wine, with impressive ripe, dense fruit. There is still elegance, a sense of proportion, but the opulence of the Chardonnay here is impossible to resist.
Juicy and soft with just a touch of tannin, this is all about red cherry fruits. A rounded texture makes the wine ready to drink.
Dark char, spicy black plums and cherries, and an undertone of earthy barnyard make for an intriguing nose, but the palate on this red blend is soft and tired. Too many green notes and a hint of Band-Aids and rubber kick in on the midpalate.
91—93 Barrel sample. Intense and rich, with powerful honey flavors. This is a wine that will impress by its power, but will probably also age well.
One of the richest Cabernets of the vintage. Amazingly soft and velvety in the mouth, yet there's a solid grip of acidity and tannins that balance the richness. The flavors are extraordinary, ranging from blackberry and cherry-pie filling through currant liqueur and milk chocolate to leather. So decadent now, it's hard to resist, but should develop for 4–6 years.
This wine combines complexity and an appealingly gentle texture to make for a compelling whole. Smoky oak influences fade into the background as the wine airs, leaving the mélange of plum, black cherry and herbal notes lingering on the mouthwatering finish. Drink now–2012.
Even big brands like Oyster Bay benefitted from the excellent vintage conditions in 2015, so consumers shouldn't be shy about trying some of them. This medium-bodied wine has a pleasant, silky texture, understated graphite and citrus aromas and flavors, and a long, mouthwatering finish.
A blend of one-third each Grenache, Mourvèdre and Syrah, year-in and year-out this is among Lirac's top wines, if not the top. In 2003, it's rich, ripe and a touch alcoholic, but still boasts well-defined aromas of plum and spice. In the mouth, it's like liquid chocolate fudge--velvety, yet never ponderous or heavy. Ready to drink now, but should last up to 10 years.
Very soft notions of ripe, yellow pear with floral overtones create a softer, luscious but completely dry palate. An ideal wine for those who like structure but mellow flavors. The savory edge of Grüner makes itself felt around the edges but never dominates and provides spicy length.
Sweet blackberry aromas come with floral edgings, and the whole is impressive. Full-bodied and balanced, with healthy, ripe black cherry and dark plum flavors. Finishes spicy, with a note of bitter espresso. 90% Tempranillo with 10% Cabernet Sauvignon. One of the best wines from Valencia.
A spicy, herbal nose and flavors of cherry and balsam recommend this softer red from Nemea. Balanced and elegant, the wine has heft but a delicate touch. Good overall flavors and acidity—pair with lighter meat fare.
Foris consistently produces a meticulously crafted, value lineup of Alsatian-inspired white wines. As with its siblings, this is crisp, detailed and balanced. Apple and pear fruit is lined with citrus rind. Give it a light chill and it will delight.
While initially quite closed, aeration reveals pretty floral notes against a backdrop of apple, tangerine and lemon flavors. It's a straightforward but refreshing dry Riesling with wide appeal. Drink now through 2018.
With polished, new-wood aromas and flavors, this is a smooth wine. Hints of mint go with the black plum notes and the firmer, bitter chocolate flavors. In a modern style, this is likely to age quickly.
Cranberryish on the nose, but there's also a note of sour red cabbage. Light and candied on the palate, combining candied cherry flavors with a soft, caramelly finish.
Yering Station makes a regular Chardonnay and a Reserve Chardonnay as well; this is its entry-level Chard, and quite a good one. Bright pineapple notes and a hint of grilled fruit are clean and fresh if somewhat straightforward in this medium-bodied wine. Drink now.
The terroir range of wines from Philippe Zinck is made to showcase the vineyards, in this case a chalk and clay property near Eguisheim. The wine is textured and full of tropical fruits—mangos and pineapple—along with a complex pepper and spice structure. Drink from 2016.
This wine has pleasing aromas of pear and melon followed by medium-sweet fruit flavors. It's not particularly serious but it goes down easy.
A complex, wood-aged wine, full in the mouth, balancing well between toast and sweet melon and apple flavors, spiked with grapefruit acidity. It would be worth aging for 2–3 years.
A few swirls of the glass release this white's heady stone fruit, Spanish broom and Mediterranean brush aromas. Mirroring the nose, the vibrant palate delivers green apple, lemon, tangerine and white peach flavors framed by crisp acidity. It has nice length and a hint of ginger that caps the finish.
Slightly more graceful and elegant than the same winery's Mathilde Reserve, which comes across as a bit chunky and oaky. This wine features cherry and vanilla notes, with a slightly creamy, easy-to-like texture in the mouth.
This 100% estate-grown Cabernet carries some of the identifying aromas of the Rocks, a part of Walla Walla where vineyards are planted on a dry river bed. Hints of earth, clay and chocolate make a lively introduction to a wine loaded with cherry and currant fruit flavors. The wine spent 20 months in French oak, but the barrel scents and flavors are handled lightly; the fruit is the star of this show. A fine debut.
Smooth and classy, a Cabernet that feels fine in the mouth. With a velvety texture, it shows ripe, extravagant flavors of blackberry and cherry jam, with vanilla and toast from oak barrels. Not an ager, but one of the better Cabernets to come out of Paso Robles.
Soft and ordinary and slightly sweet in jammy fruit, this Syrah has forward flavors of black cherry jam, anise, mocha and pepper.
Aromas of spring wildflower and white stone fruit lead the nose while the foaming, off-dry palate doles out creamy yellow pear and candied citrus peel. Bright acidity lifts the rich flavors.
This wine emits details of iron and citrus rind along with somewhat stark, tight fruit flavors that are often associated with Red Mountain Syrah. Racy and bracing, this will improve with 1–2 more years in the bottle.
It has attractive acidity and fragrant, juicy fruitiness. Underneath this fruit is a solid structure, fine tannins and fresh final acidity.
Composed of 62% Sauvignon Blanc and 38% Sémillon, Bianca's White is minimally oaked and somewhat extreme in its acidity, with an intensity of tart flavor.
Smells volatile and balsamic, much like salad dressing. There's no doubting this wine is Cab Franc—it's herbal and foresty, with a soft mouthfeel and herbal berry flavors topped off by oregano and basil. A rustic wine that's probably too herbal for most palates.
This estate bottling showcases ripe apple and melon fruit, spiced with sweet barrel notes and toast. The wine spent some months in 20% new French oak.

Wood aging gives this wine its weight and richness. Strawberry and blackberry fruits show strongly alongside the firm structure and considerable acidity. Drink from 2016.
Tannic and mineral, this is intensely structured. With its firm tannins and dark plum flavors, it is on the dry side, needing 2–3 years to show its best. This is Beaujolais for aging.
Slightly minty at first, with resiny oak, berry and mild leafy aromas. Things fall into line with airing, and the palate of savory, barrel-accented berry fruit is mildly herbal but solid. A little drying and leafy but pretty good overall.
Pretty much as good as Bjornstad's single-vineyard bottlings. It's opulent and creamy, with exotic tropical fruit, green apple, pear and honey flavors, elaborately oaked and spicy. Wonderful acidity gives a clean scour to all the richness.
This is a finely structured wine that will age well. With black-plum fruits, layers of dark young tannins and balanced acidity, it is both juicy and full of great ripe swathes of fruit. From the cru estate that is owned by Louis Jadot in Beaune, it is impressive and worth aging. Drink from 2018.
Thick and sultry smelling, with aromas of menthol, mint, tobacco, leather and ripe black fruits. Feels good but oaky, with resiny tannins and baked berry and vanilla flavors. Dark, toasty and mellow on the finish. Shows ripeness, balance and lots of oak. Drink now through 2014.
This frothy wine opens with floral aromas that recall acacia flower, dried chamomile and a whiff of honey. The palate offers yellow apple, peach and a hint of bread crust alongside brisk acidity. It ends on a note of bitter almond.
A lively number with kick and effervescence. The nose is kind, with light fruits and a whiff of chocolate. Plum and raspberry flavors are nice and accented by earthy spice, while the wine's texture and structure seem more than solid, given its everyday price.
A drop-dead gorgeous Pinot Noir that will satisfy everyone from Burgundy fans to diehard Cabernet cultists. Show an elegant complexity and silky texture that define great California Pinot Noir, yet with a powerful impact that emphasizes raspberries, cherries and blueberries. Brilliant acidity and tannins provide the perfect framework on this wine that's drinkable now, and will develop over the next 15–20 years.
Dry, sharp in acidity and rather green, a tough Merlot to love despite some decent cherry and spice flavors.
What a pretty wine. Made for drinking soon, it shows impeccable balance in the finely ground tannins, moderate alcohol and deft touch of oak. Feels soft and complex in the mouth, carrying flavors of berries, herbs, mocha and sandalwood. Easy to find, with 16,056 cases produced.
Aggressive smelling early on but then it settles on classy raspberry, cassis and herbs. The palate is very healthy, juicy, rich and big, but the flavors of dark berry fruit are subtle and smooth. Chunky, sweet and ripe on the finish. A Malbec to drink this winter. Only 300 cases produced.
A soft, easy style that should have broad appeal, this modest spätlese marries slightly confected, ripe fruit flavors with more balanced citrusy notes. Drink now.
A fine Zin from some of Sonoma's best vineyards. Briary and rustic, it brims with dry, savory flavors of wild berries, cherries and spices, with a rich finish that goes on for a good 30 seconds.
As fine as this Cab is, it's best to leave it alone for some years to develop bottle complexity. It's a big, rich, dry wine, with a huge core of black currant and cassis fruit, but the sticky tannins kick in right away and don't quit. Should be very good after 2008.
Only the second released vintage of this wine for Felton Road, and already the improvement is noticeable. The black cherry fruit is bold, the vanilla-laced oak assertive, and the overall impression is one of power rather than nuance. Maybe that will come with age.
Called 2 Worlds because of the two different vineyards that go into the blend, this is a structured, firm wine. It has a fine balance between the acidity, the tannins and the black currant fruit. With its texture and dry core, it needs time, so drink after 2015.
This is a beautifully structured ripe wine that is full of dense red fruits and tightly wrought acidity. Crisply textured raspberry flavors dominate. This is a rich wine that can be kept for a few months. Drink at the end of 2017.
This looks to be reasonably long-lived, as it's firm but fine. Cherries, mushrooms and toasty oak mingle easily around a backbone of silky tannins and crisp acids. Drink 2016–2022.
Tart, bright fruit flavors are beginning to soften with age. In the mix are black cherry, blackberry and plum. Substantial tannins provide a bed of coffee and cocoa, with a finish of clean, moist earth.

These Gewürztraminer grapes are left to sweeten on the vine until mid-December, resulting in a decadently rich and fragrant dessert wine from Italy's mountainous north. It reveals divine tones of apricot, honey, spring flower and jasmine.
There's a tonic quality to this Pinot Nero that combines ashy mineral notes with wild berries, toasted almonds and blue flowers. There's also a warm, sun-drenched quality that adds to the overall intensity and concentration.
Silky and fragrant, this opens with aromas of Spanish broom, pressed white flowers, baked apple and citrus. The firm, vibrant palate delivers ripe Bartlett pear, nectarine zest, lime and a note of crystallized ginger alongside tangy acidity and firm, refined perlage.
Tough and resilient in acids and tannins, but elegantly streamlined. Shows tart flavors of sour red cherry candy, vanilla and sweet sandalwood. Now–2014.
This light-bodied white starts with a nose of tropical fruit and citrus, leading in to flavors of creamy pineapple and fruit lifted by a crisp acidity. The wine has a lively character with a peppery spin. Pair with grilled seafood, fresh oysters.
There's something Alexander Valley-esque in the soft complexity of the tannins, and the slight herbaceousness that accompanies the black currants, cured tobacco and grilled meat. It's also a classic Petite Syrah, with that variety's inky black color and impenetrable tannins and dryness. This wine surely wants until 2020 in the cellar.
Zesty and lean, this exquisitely fine-framed Riesling builds in intensity. It's mineral and spry from start to finish, but juicy-sweet tangerine and honey notes add brightness and sunshine to the midpalate. It's enjoyable now, but likely to intensify through 2025.
This has a touch of austerity, with savory spice, cured meat and teriyaki aromas. The palate bursts with bright red fruit and smooth tannins.

Fragrant opening notes of fennel, tobacco and lime introduce a well-crafted Cabernet sourced from the Pepper Bridge vineyard. The fruit flavors are quite dry, slightly attenuated, and hinting at herbs throughout.
Very fruity in flavor and tangy in mouthfeel, this full-bodied wine combines lively acidity with citrus, herb and ripe pear flavors and a touch of sweetness. Little or no oak influence comes through, so the vivid fruit components take center stage.
Choosing favorites among Kumeu River's Chardonnays is always difficult. The 2013 Maté's is potentially the longest lived of this year's releases, showcasing tight, crisp citrus fruit garnished with hints of butter, tropical fruit and mocha-like oak. Drink 2018–2025.
Marked by extreme ripeness, this Pinot is a blast of red cherry pie filling, red licorice and cola flavors, with a smoky note of bacon fat. Delicious, but a bit soft and simple in texture.
Intense smoke and nut-skin aromas add an earthy, savory minerality to rich, sweet Meyer lemon and orange-peel notes on the palate of this delicate yet powerful wine. There's massive complexity here, revealing itself in layers and layers on the long, lingering palate.
Old-vine Shiraz from the valley floor imparts great richness and a creamy texture to this wine's tannins, framed easily by hints of vanilla. Yet it's not a simple fruit-and-oak concoction—with time in the glass it steadily unfurls to reveal herbal and spice complexities. Marries power and elegance;  drink now–2015.
A 100% Tempranillo that is unfined, unfiltered and aged in 100% French oak, this wine is softly layered and ripe in black cherry, blackberry and dusty leather. Medium bodied, with a taste of tobacco on the finish, it's lush without being jammy.
Resplendent in its new shiny gold label, Krug is a majestic Champagne. Its velvet texture, dominated by mature flavors, is toasty and rich, dense and complex. In the mouth, its beautiful roasted almond, spice and ripe pears all balance impressively. Could the wine be getting even better? No question—this is still one of the greatest nonvintage Champagnes.
Spunky dark fruit aromas open the show, with leather, cheese and mocha coming in later. The palate is a little grabby and acidic, but the juicy flavors of plum, wild berry, citrus and cassis are good. Finishes with some bounce in its step due to full acidity, and overall it maintains freshness and zest. Malbec with smaller doses of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cab Franc and Merlot.
Delicate aromas of wild berry, blue flower and a hint chopped herb lead the nose. The soft, easygoing palate offers black cherry and a hint of baking spice. Round tannins and vibrant acidity make it ready to drink now.

This is a fresh, vibrant stainless steel-fermented Chard that boasts charming notes of fresh apple slices, nectarine, lemon rind citrus and a hint of yellow florals. It's ripe and big without being too spicy or overdone, with a solid, lengthy finish. Drink now.
Tasted in January, this Merlot was still quite unresolved. Oak dominated, with its characteristic vanilla and caramel notes, while underneath was a substantial core of cherries, blackberries, currants, cocoa and roasted almonds, reminiscent of a granola bar. It's a distinguished Merlot, but one that wants a few years in the cellar.
Solid and dry, this is a tightly structured wine. Layered acidity and berry fruits lend a powerful, concentrated feel. It does need time to bring out its inherent fruitiness. Drink from 2015.
This is a nice Bordeaux-style blend with pretty cherry and currant fruit and some cedar shadings, but lack the complexity of others in its style. It's straight forward, polite and restrained.
Roast beef, grape candy, cracked blueberry, beef char and grapy freshness come to the nose on this bottling. The candied grape and blueberry elements carry dark-fruit character to the palate, along with licorice that gives depth. Roasting herbs in the midpalate adds savory flair.
Full-bodied for a rosé (as Tavel should be), this wine boasts plenty of cherry-berry fruit, but also appealing, complex notes of fresh thyme, ground clove and aniseed. Drink this blend of 60% Grenache, 20% Cinsault, 10% Syrah and 10% Clairette (a white grape variety) over the rest of 2017.
Given neutral oak, native yeast, passive carbonation and left unfined and unfiltered, this sublime wine, made by Pax Mahle and sourced from a windswept vineyard impacted by the Petaluma Gap, doesn't hold back in flavor or complexity. Gamy manure and white pepper mingle on the nose before opening the way to sultry, brooding waves of spicy, tangy orange and plum. This wine is pretty and powerful at the same time, while riding a low-wave of alcohol.
This concentrated wine leads with citrus and stone fruits, and a lightly peppery mouthfeel. Leesy and creamy and textural, it's generously loaded with flavors of lime and grapefruit, stone and fresh herb. This is a subtle and very refreshing Viognier.
Floral, sweet and not the least bit complicated or strained. This is easygoing red wine for easy times. It's a bit candied and baked, but that's Garnacha from Central Spain. Decently balanced and sturdy, especially given the price tag.
Wood flavors dominate this young wine. It has structure and tannins, with concentrated toast and chocolate flavors. The extraction of the fruit gives the wine a bitter character. It should soften, so drink from 2019.
After 23 months in barrel, this Viura-Malvasia blend shows a yellow color and dry resiny oak-based aromas along with apple in the backdrop. Round and slightly oily in texture, this tastes of salted nuts and baked apple on a woody base. Oaky salty flavors persist on the finish.
The second wine of fourth-growth Beychevelle is named after a 17th century owner, French Admiral de la Valette, who insisted passing ships in the Gironde estuary salute his riverfront property. The wine is a proper second wine, firm while also showing the way it will develop relatively quickly. Juicy black currants and generous tannins are balanced with acidity and a dry core. This fine wine will be ready to drink from 2021.
Made with 90% Sangiovese and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon, this has subdued aromas of toast, underbrush and sunbaked earth. The round approachable palate offers mature black cherry and hints of cake spice.

This is a sweet, dense wine, balancing lively dried fruit flavors against intense coffee and treacle. It has great style, a powerful wine that manages to present a softer side.
Forward, fruity and flavorful, this is a quite pretty compendium of raspberry and cherry fruit, accented with a touch of orange peel. As with J. Christopher's pricier cuvées, it spent 18 months in one-quarter new French oak. Though labeled simply Willamette Valley, the fruit was sourced principally from the prestigious Dundee Hills AVA.
This is a very personalized, very different Merlot that shows beautiful elegance and grace thanks to cool-climate growing conditions and clay soils. The wine opens with a dark, full color and offers pristine aromas of cherry, pomegranate, leather and savory shades of spice.
The most southern of the crus bourgeois estates in Margaux, the house at Siran is familiar to visitors from its pink exterior. This vintage is powerful, but still manages to exude that Margaux style and poise. There are dense tannins but they don't overwhelm, leaving fine black fruits to balance the dryness.
Totally fresh, this offers attractive, young citrus flavors that are given a broader brush by the creamed apple texture that rounds out the wine. Crisp, it could be drunk now and will be better from 2016.
This soft wine shows some of the Aligoté crispness that has become creamy and smooth. There are touches of yellow fruits as well as lively acidity and a gentle aftertaste. Drink now.
This wine has an initial strong tannic element that submerges the red fruits. As it opens, the wine reveals more juiciness, berry flavors and fresh acidity. It's still young and needs to be aged. Drink from 2018.
Thin and rather raw, with decent citrus flavors. Will do in a pinch.
Ripe and forward in the modern cult style, with flavors of blackberry tart, black currants, milk chocolate and ripe mulberry, in addition to sweet, smoky oak. Sturdy mountain tannins provide structural bite, and should help the wine mature beyond 2011.
This easygoing white is just what most people will want to sip with tapas, appetizers or on its own. It's briny and citrusy on the palate, which is typical for Rueda, and the finish is lasting, with green-herb flavors, cutting acidity and elegance.
An abundance of chaparral spice adds intrigue to the nose of this bottling by veteran Ken Brown. Dried sage and a eucalyptus-like menthol character decorate the red currant and raspberry core. Pine needles play prominently on the palate, giving depth to the cranberry, pomegranate and white-pepper flavors. It offers tons of flair, but also elegance.
This smells reedy and scratchy, turning more herbal with time in the glass. Astringent acids create a sharp mouthfeel, and while the flavors include raspberry and strawberry, there's also a weedy component that picks up speed as the wine breathes.
This Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot blend almost has enough of the right stuff to rate higher, but in the end the wine's tart cherry fruit and sharp acidity is just too unfriendly. Like so many Brazilian wines, it's trying to be more than the country's terroir can give. So the end result is mediocre.
Very lightly textured, this fruity, fresh wine has a hint of caramel to accent flavors of citrus and red berries. The aftertaste is clean and always packed with fruit. Screwcap.
From one of the few Chardonnay vineyards in Dizy, this is a tight wine, with a steely character, very crisp and citric. Even at nine years age, it tastes young, structured, demanding aging.
With savory, leafy, balsamic aromas, this is good but sedentary on the nose. In the mouth, it's full but a little flat, with a mild pulse and meaty, balsamic flavors of earthy berry and prune. A short, earthy finish closes it out.
Extravagantly rich and oaky, this Chardonnay detonates on the palate with pineapple, lemon and orange jam, buttered toast and vanilla cream flavors. Finishes honey sweet, but a nice edge of acidity provides needed balance.
Aged for more than two years in French, American and Hungarian oak, this vineyard-designate is bombastically broad-shouldered in cocoa powder and leather, Soft and velvety on the palate, it finishes with a spark of heat.
Lovely aromas greet you straight from the glass, as this young, juicy Columbia Valley Merlot brings its bright cherry-berry fruit right up front. There are intimations of chocolate— nothing too heavy—and a clean finish with a lick of stems in the tannin.
Smooth and ripe, this is a rich black-fruited wine, its tannins comfortably ensconsed in a rich cushion. There is acidity to balance and spice which, along with the full-bodied fruit character, makes the wine ready to drink now.
Yellow fruits and fresh aromas characterize this attractive, fresh wine. With a touch of citrus to add to the bright character, it's a fruity wine that can be drunk now–2017.
The wine begins with an ethereal lift of dried thyme coupled with candied orange and lemon peels. The palate is dry and intense, as though it were about to reveal the secrets of time held in the rocky slopes where it grew. As a late release, this is a prime example of the rewards of delayed gratification. The palate has taken on an almost oily texture but the tight acidity keeps it elixier-like.
Made in a dry, tannic style, this Cab-based wine offers a nice alternative to today's overripe, soft Cabernets. There's a firmness in the mouth and a rich earthiness to the blackberries, black currants and cedar. This chewy, impressive wine will develop through 2012 or so.
Northwest of the Anderson Valley, from an area that may someday be known as Mendocino Coast, comes this slightly rustic Pinot. The berry-cherry fruit has edges of tobacco, dill, tea, hay and spice, and the finish is fairly tannic.
Damp earthy berry aromas are a touch murky. This feels bulky, grabby and tannic, while overriding flavors of coffee, toast and bitter chocolate make fruit a bit player. A choppy finish with hard tannins and herbal berry flavors puts this Cabernet in the midtier category.
Produced in partnership between Schulz Cellars and Lamprydae Vineyards, Communication Block wines benefit Napa Valley Kids Connect, a non-profit for kids with motor and communication difficulties. Light and very pretty, this Grenache Blanc is easy drinking with a swish of vanilla on the finish.
Potent up front, with aromas of Boston baked beans, dry red fruit, leather and charcoal. Medium in the mouth, with cherry and plum floating on a classic structure of bright acids and robust tannins. Finishes lithe and fresh, with a shot of tomato and leather.
Attractively fresh and herbaceous, this is a bright and fruity wine. It has flavors of red currant and grapefruit, plus a hint of gooseberry. Full and crisp, it's a wine to drink soon.
Baked apple and pastry flavors, along with a darkening gold color, suggest a wine approaching its twilight. Buttery and soft; drink up.
Ripe peach and lemon bar make for a decadent nose, and the palate follows through with notes of candied fruit and crystallized ginger. White cherry notes on the medium finish seal the indulgent experience. Drink on its own.
Toast, butter and tropical fruit aromas are all typical of Chile, but there's a touch of saline and minerality as well. Lemony and tangy in the mouth, with a juicy, acidic feel that's a bit like Chablis. Only trouble is, it finishes bland and pithy.
Made with organically cultivated grapes, this opens with aromas of orange blossom, orchard fruit and nuts. The savory, medium-bodied palate doles out layers of juicy nectarine, lime zest, ripe pear and mature yellow apple alongside a note of candied ginger. It finishes on a tangy note.
Rubbery and green, with heavy, weedy flavors and some heat. Turns toward barnyard as it opens up. Lacks pizzazz and probably won't inspire.
Here is a lighter, paler shade of Prosecco with opulent and cheerful soapy and herbal qualities (thanks to 10% Pinot Bianco) backed by lemon candy and polished mineral. Yellow apple and chalk are immediately recognizable. The mouthfeel is creamy and foamy with fresh crispness that is noticeable but not exaggerated.
Quite a distinguished Cabernet. Shows its pedigree in ultra-refined tannins and an overall mouthfeel of lushness and finesse. Flavor-wise, it's all black currants, blueberries and sweet, smoky oak. Thirty-five dollars isn't cheap, but this is as good as it gets in this price bracket.
Aromas of wild berry, floral notes and light spice shadings make for a very nice balance. The wine is tannic, dry and raw in the mouth. It should be paired with melted chèvre cheese on baguette.
Richly aromatic, on the strength of the nose alone this could pass for something from Napa's Rutherford Bench. The blue and purple fruit notes and dusty tannins all say California, but the laser-like definition, minerality and natural acidity prove it's Washington fruit all the way. Strikingly dense and complex, with decades of life ahead.
This wine's crusty, minerally aromas of black fruit are lightly toasted and earthy. On the palate, it feels tannic and high in acidity, with roasted, earthy flavors of plum and raspberry. Concentrated and grabby on the finish, it has a touch of lemony oak and astringency.
This is a fantastic expression from the Lake Garda area. This dark and well-concentrated wine shows intense aromas of cherry, pomegranate, plum and fresh prune. There are also background shadings of exotic spice and the wine is sweet, rich and long lasting. Villa Medici presents a bold, modern interpretation of a traditional wine.
Here's a Brunello with a determined focus on sophistication and elegance. The wine is smooth and pristine and delivers delicate nuances of wild berry, graphite, smoke and Indian spice. The overall approach here is one that fully embraces Brunello tradition: the wine offers power and intensity but not in an exaggerated manner.
Dry and refreshing with clean, pure notes of white peach, orange blossoms and petrol on the nose and palate, this shows off Riesling's pristine side. A splash of tart, underripe starfruit and fresh limes on the palate combine with a brisk acidity and wet stone minerality, giving this wine an invigorating feel.
Power, density, huge richness—all the attributes you would expect from a Corton-Charlemagne. But, this being 2006, the ripe tropical fruits are crispened with acidity which cuts through the impressive opulence and ripeness.
This is a bright wine—still a little closed but promising fine fruitiness for the future. With herbal acidity, lemon and grapefruit flavors and a zesty tang at the end, it will develop relatively quickly. Drink from 2020.
There's a modern, velvety touch to this blend of indigenous grapes (Magliocco, Montonico Nero and Greco) that are cultivated in one of the most isolated spots in southern Italy. Black cherry, chocolate and exotic spice notes lend a soft, silky feel to the wine.
This blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 31% Cabernet Franc and 19% Merlot has aromas of toast, fresh-brewed coffee, graphite, dried herbs and milk chocolate. It's silky and elegant yet densely flavored, backed by grainy tannins.
Identified only as a “field blend,” this well-balanced wine offers citrus (lime), apple and peach flavors, along with a whiff of honeycomb. The texture is most appealing, and hints at just-picked green herbs.
Orange peel and pine are the main aromas on a slightly oily nose. This feels full and balanced, with flavors of mango, banana and lychee. There isn't a lot of complexity to a citrusy finish, but this still ranks as an excellent sweet Moscatel.
Deep gold and redolent of buttered nuts, this is made in the comfortable California style featuring barrel fermentation, full malolactic and extended oak aging on the lees. Results are predictably ripe and oaky, buttery and soft, with just a hint of baked apple acidity thanks to Washington-grown fruit.
Pointed, sharp aromas leave an angular bouquet. The rest of the wine is jumpy, furry and a bit funky, with pointed plum and raspberry flavors and then a toasty, oaky finish with bitterness, heat and leftover butter flavors.
This is the most dynamic 2011 entry in Matthias Pippig's Loner series, starting with aromas of lemon juice, lime sorbet, wet chalk, white pepper and crushed herbs. The tight, mineral-driven flavors dance across diced peaches and baked apples, with lime spritzer and baking soda thrown on top.
Nutty, spicy aromas are followed by a beautiful mélange of toasted nut, cream and fresh fruit. The wine is rounded and elegant with its mineral lift and toasted finish. Pair with lobster, salmon and poultry.
Pretty cherry fruit, lightly candied, steals the show here. There's a dash of cinnamon and a pleasantly toasty frame around the tannins, all in proportion and delivering clean, generous flavors through the lingering finish.
This is a lightly sweet wine, with a soft hint of honey. It shows peach and mango flavors, along with a round texture from the superripe late-harvest grapes. The finish is fresh and crisp.
Rarely will you find more hickory and barbecued aromas and flavors than this RDD is showing. In the mouth, it's tannic, woody, astringent and hard as rocks. Flavors of campfire, roasted blackberry and barbecue sauce finish meaty in feel, with matching flavors of beef jerky and bacon. Tasted twice with mixed results.
A partnership between winemaker Jesse Katz and Colorado-based sommelier Brett Zimmerman, this 100% varietal wine is intensely powerful and concentrated yet balanced between ripeness and body. Cranberry and cassis fruit meet savory pine and leather notes, settling into a finish of smooth clove and pipe tobacco.
With a 10% barrel fermentation, this is a smooth Pinot Blanc. It has a luscious creamy texture, with pear, quince and green plum flavors. The ripe richness is well balanced with a fine layer of acidity.
A splendid nose with rose petals, lychee and melon starts this off well, and it continues with expressive fruit and tongue-coating oiliness. It's clean and rich, dry and robust, and would be ideal with a moderately spicy Thai curry.
This linear red has attractive aromas of fragrant blue flower, red berry and chopped herb. The taut medium-bodied palate offers dried black cherry, red currant, white pepper and a note of dried sage alongside fine-grained tannins and bright acidity.
The grapes come mainly from the Rancho Santa Rosa vineyard, which is a great one, source to many top-scoring Chardonnays over the years. The wine is brisk,  tart and clean, with rich, dramatic flavors of pineapple, lime, honeysuckle and buttered toast. Really elegant and wonderful, and should blossom through early 2012.
High-toned strawberry and cherry open this medium-bodied wine that takes on heavier, darker overtones of dried herb, nutmeg and black tea as it goes. From a meticulously farmed vineyard also known for Chardonnay, it conveys a stamp of tobacco on the oak that invites thoughts of leather chairs and cigars.
Nice and crisp in coastal acidity, with a delightfully silky texture and ripe flavors of cherries, pomegranates, rhubarb, cedar and pepper spice. Tastes a little sugary toward the finish.
This is a great example of how Pinot Noir doesn't need deep color and overripe flavors to be fascinating and delicious. Light in appearance and tawny rather than bright red at the rim, it exudes nutmeg, cherry and pomegranate aromas. The flavors are fruity and nervy, all tart cherry, and raspberry with black tea accents, excellent acidity and firm, light tannins.
Lots of sweet fruit and oak in this easy-drinking, sophisticated Pinot. It shows raspberry, cherry, vanilla and buttered toast flavors, sprinkled with the clove, cinnamon and white pepper spices that the Santa Maria Valley is famous for. Drink now.
A pure, all-out Zinfandel with enticing black and red fruit on the nose followed by spicy, black peppery undertones and rich berry and plum. Tannins are nicely integrated yet still pronounced yet the finish is long and incredibly smooth.
Here's a savory Chianti showing violet and plum aromas with hints of leather. The palate offers black cherry, prune and white pepper flavors, all nicely balanced with edgy but refined tannins and fresh acidity. It will pair beautifully with pastas and bean soups.
Here's a nicely balanced Barbera d'Asti Superiore from the Nizza subzone that shows not too much fruit and not too much oak. The wine is clean and polished and delivers light steps on the palate, unlike some of the much denser and heavier expressions you will find. Very nice and elegant.
This wine is oaky; it's 100% barrel fermented and aged in new French oak for 12 months. Despite that, it's not over the top. Aromas of smoke and cured meats lead the way, then sweet pears. The texture is slick—even oily—and definitely viscous. Finishes long, with plenty of oak-imparted spice.
This small winery and family-run bed-and-breakfast takes an artisanal approach to winemaking with this sparkler, which offers a yellow fruit flavor, with accents of spice and bitter almond.
This intensely young wine holds considerable potential. Weight and rich fruits are still developing alongside the firm, mineral and steel structure. It's impressively rich, packed with green fruits and laced with citrus. Drink from 2018.
This is the richest and most satisfying of the winery's four 2010 Pinot Noirs. It's not an ager, but the flavors of raspberry and cherry jam are forward and tasty, with a tart edge of spicy licorice. Drink it now for maximum freshness.
Pinotage, with its often rustic, eccentric character, is typically a hard sell outside of South Africa. But producers like Lindhorst are proving that the variety can be just as appealing as any other red. This shows appetizing aromas of spiced meat and soft red berry, and on the palate, it has a round, velvety mouthfeel that is atypical of the sometimes prickly Pinotage. Pretty and full of dimension, the wine is a great introduction to the grape.
Soft, ripe wine with some attractive red berry fruits, touches of mint and leather tannic edge.
Grown 2,200 feet in elevation, Angel's Secret Petite is a black monster, peppery and flavored of caramel molasses and plenty of dark berry notes. Give it another couple months to age and pair it with big game and all will be well.
Nicely dry, silky and delicate in structure, this has pleasant cherry and cola flavors that are brightened by acidity. It finishes with the sweetness of toasted oak. While it's not particularly complex, it does offer plenty of varietal pleasure. Drink now.
Green tannins mark this dry Pinot Noir, and the astringency accentuates the acidity, giving the wine a harsh mouthfeel. Although it has expressive cherry, pomegranate and cola flavors, it's a big disappointment, coming from this famous vineyard and block.
There's more rhubarb and bramble here than we prefer from a young, everyday Malbec, and thus the bouquet is austere and only skin deep. As might be expected given the aromas, the palate is limited to herbal, lightly pickled red fruit, while the finish is quick and offers some lasting chocolate. Decent wine, but that's as far as it goes.
Rustic and sharp in unevenly ripened tannins, with some green, minty flavors right beside sweet, jammy ones of raspberries and cola. Zin's spices are there, bigtime.
This concentrated effort boasts rich, ripe yellow-fruit and citrus flavors as well as fine acidity. It is packed with fruit, but it also has a firm, steely, nervy texture. It should be aged for 2–3 years, maybe more, for maximum effect.
88-90 Barrel sample. This is rich, with sweet fruits and delicious sweet plum flavors, good tannins, a lovely juicy character.
From the Nunes Vineyard, this robust red is concentrated in black cherry, tar and cinnamon spice, full bodied from having been cradled in French oak, 20% of it new. The acidity and body are both medium level, while the ripeness is high.
Full-bodied and richly textured, this ultradark, concentrated Merlot makes a statement. Toast and vanilla shadings mark the bold cassis fruit, which glides easily into a long, velvety finish tinged with mocha. Drink now–2020—and possibly beyond, as this should prove to be a long-lived example.
A 100% varietal, site-specific wine from the heart of the appellation, this succeeds in a herbal persistence and lean nose. Red currant, cassis and anise wrap around thick tannins, with lingering notes of clove and cedar.
Pear, peach and tropical fruits all roll together in this wine, with just a touch of toasty character. The wine is rounded and full, but still fresh.
Strawberry and raspberry fruit carry a nice touch of bright spice, notably saffron. Some 30% new French oak was used, and the wine expresses it with highlights of toasted coconut. The wine has medium concentration and length, and will benefit from aggressive aeration.
This super Tuscan blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot has a sweet smelling nose that is accented by raspberry, Christmas spice, cinnamon, clove and scented candle. Layers of chocolate and coffee fill the mouth and the wine is smooth and soft on the finish.
With its softness and medium-dry character, this is a great food wine for pâtés or blue cheese. It is finely in balance, its acidity giving a lift to the tangerine, peach and dried fruit flavors. The aftertaste is perfectly clean, creamy, lifted by acidity.
Here's a slightly more sophisticated and evolved Barbera d'Asti from the 2008 vintage. There are notes of fresh fruit, spice, wet earth and a touch of natural rubber. The wine is exceedingly crisp, clean and polished in the mouth. Very nice, simple and pure.
A complex name for this finely crafted wine. It shows green fruits and oak, some intensity of flavor and a great layer of acidity, cutting through the rich fruits. The finish brings all this acidity forward, giving a classic Chablis minerality.
La Rosa's first-ever prestige wine is a burly blend of Cab Sauvignon, Carmenère, Syrah and Cab Franc. There's a deep color to it, with coconut, mint and pencil shaving aromas giving way to sweet, chocolaty, dark-fruit flavors. The 30% Carmenère in the blend is evident in the herbal, leathery notes on the finish.
This wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (60%), Merlot (26%), Cabernet Franc (10%), Petit Verdot (2%) and Malbec. Aromas of tire rubber and green pepper bring some distraction to the notes of spice and plum. The palate seems disjointed, with oddly smoky flavors that seem out of place.
Rich and smooth, polished with spice and wood, while balanced with herbaceous, ripe fruit. Hints of minerality give an extra texture to this intensely flavored wine.
A fine, elegant wood-aged wine. It has ripe fruits, sweet peach, apricot, mango, while the vanilla of toast lifts all the flavors, adding spicy smoothness. Acidity comes from fresh lime. It could do with some aging, maybe 2–3 years.
Opi Riserva is a dense wine (in a heavy bottle) that would pair with spicy barbecue sauce and succulent grilled meats. The wine is redolent of mature fruit, blackberry jam, exotic spice, clove and cinnamon. It's a soft, sticky expression with long spice flavors on a slightly sweet finish.
The oak is far out in front, with the aromas of vanilla, dill and freshly hewn wood making it difficult to find the fruit. Cranberry flavors struggle to get to the surface. It's technically well made but the barrel treatment completely overrides any sense of the variety.
Slightly fizzy and incredibly fragrant, this radiant sparkler boasts heady scents of honeysuckle, lemon blossom and white stone fruit. The crisp dry palate delivers green apple, Bartlett pear, citrus zest and a saline note alongside vibrant acidity and lightly foaming bubbles. Fermented in the bottle, it has some sediment at the bottom that adds flavor and complexity.
This shows the tightly knit tannins of Spring Mountain, and is unapologetic about them, demanding that you cellar this wine. It's very finely constructed, with brisk acidity and a firm, grounding minerality below the intensely concentrated core of blackberry and cassis flavors. It should hit its stride in 8-10 years and go for well beyond that.
Off-dry, with pineapple, lime, lemon, grapefruit and vanilla flavors, fortunately balanced with crisp acidity. A decent, clean and affordable white wine for cocktails.
Deliciously tangy as well as ripe, this is a textured, red fruit and vanilla-flavored wine that also has a touch of tannin. Acidity and a rounded aftertaste make this instantly drinkable. The blend is Syrah (40%), Grenache (30%), Cinsault (20%) and Cabernet Sauvignon (10%).
When botrytis struck, the Bien Nacido Vineyard-owning Miller family (who plan to steadily up production on this brand) made this dessert wine. This show honey, concentrated honey blossoms, golden raisin and baklava notes on the nose. The palate is expectedly viscous yet intriguingly grippy, with flavors of dried lemon peel, chamomile and honey butter, finishing on peanut brittle.
Alderbrook's winemaker could have made a big, fruity wine in this warm vintage, but seems to have decided to make a more delicate, higher-acid Chard instead. This food-friendly sipper has nice peach, apple and pineapple flavors, and is balanced, dry and elegant.
Meaty, herbal aromas are a bit rooty and mossy but with time they offer up berry fruit and spice. The palate is full and plump, and also a little hard and tannic, while the flavors suggest prune and cassis. Spicy and with good feel to the finish.
Skuttlebutt is a second tier in Stella Bella's range that can represent excellent value. This blend shows some of Cabernet's pungent leafiness, but also plenty of Shiraz's fruity volume to balance things out. At four years of age, the tannins are nicely supple and silky, with the wine's various components in elegant harmony. It's ready to drink now.
Fresh, dark strawberry aromas mix with allspice, cinnamon strudel and cherry blossom scents on this wine from a renowned Los Gatos vineyard. The palate is more restrained, quite tight and wound up at first, with cranberry and iron flavors that open to darker red fruits with lots of oregano and garden spices. Drink 2018–2025.
Browning in color, with mounds of dry spice, tea and earth aromas, but also a cooked, overoaked quality that doesn't serve the wine well. The palate is plodding and doesn't really evolve, while flavors of brown sugar, obvious oak and roasted berry seem to be fading. Expensive for what's in the bottle.
Coppery pink highlights and light hints of citrus are coupled with wonderfully refreshing acidity and some richer yeast notes in the background. An enlivening, zippy apéritif, with subtle strawberry hints.
Here's a rustic, everyday Pinot Noir, but it's dry and silky, with some good cherry, sandalwood and spice flavors. Nothing terribly complicated, but a decent sipper.
There are a lot of ripe, upfront pineapple and orange flavors in this Chardonnay, with a touch of vanilla and buttered toast. It has good acidity, making it clean and bright.
Honeyed aromas of wheat bread and stone fruits are not as convincing as the wine's citrus, melon and honey flavors, which are supported by a full almost-sticky body. A creamy, chunky finish, like the palate, pulls up short of sticky.
A blend of Colombard and Chardonnay, this wine is crisp and fruity. It has attractive bright acidity with lemon fruitiness and a mineral texture. The wine is ready to drink.
High toned lychee, melon and rose perfume abounds on this classically aromatic Gewürztraminer. Semidry in style, it balances juicy, primary tropical fruit flavors against crisp tangerine acidity. Big in body and ripeness, its lusciously textured mouthfeel clings deliciously on the finish.
The chef returns to wine in this blend of mostly Chardonnay with 4% Viognier. A smooth, round and ripely agreeable quaff, it's thick in oak with a taste of vanilla.
Ripe, smooth, just veering toward rustic, but also showing a fine balance of tannins and sweet fruit. It is certainly rich, while the spicy character, with the dried fruits, is generous. The acidity is understated.
Fully oaked, so the nose deals plenty of coffee and maple. Under that there's vibrant red-cherry and cassis flavors amid firm tannins. The finish is solid and spicy, with chocolate folded in. Although it is a bit gritty and hard now, each additional month you hold it the hardness will dissipate. Made of 70% Malbec and 30% Bonarda.  Imported by 57 Main Street Wine Co.
Some caramel and candied fruit goes well with the flowery element on the bouquet. In the mouth, lime, peach and mineral run the show. After that comes a clean, light finish with just a hint of stone-fruit flavor. A good mouthfeel ensures that this will be a decent wine for trout caught during the summer.
A superstar in this new vintage, this wonderfully concentrated and well-delineated wine offers precise fruit flavors of etched and sculpted peach, apricot and melon in perfect proportion. There is ample acidity under the 19 g/l residual sugar.
A seemingly sweet, simple but likeable Chardonnay, this shows the buttered toast and buttered popcorn flavors so popular among consumers, with rich pineapple and mango notes and a nice burst of Carneros acidity.
You can taste the craftsmanship in this beautiful wine. The color is a brilliant light copper, the aromas and flavors remind you that the wine is made from 75% Pinot Noir, with cherry and cinnamon notes delicately coming through. A hint of fresh baked bread comes out on the palate and stays on the finish. Very tasty, and elegant in style.
The aromas are rather shy on the nose—there is just a mere floral whiff. The palate is dry and lets us see subtle varietal aromas: golden peach, a touch of honeysuckle spice, a hint of jasmine, aromatic orange zest. This is a restrained, streamlined and elegant varietal expression. Drink now through 2030.
Aromas of corn and melon are decent but hardly the stuff of legend. This feels full and round, with flavors of melon and peach, with a candied honey finish.
Structured and dense, this bold Brunello offers big color, density and extraction. On the nose, it is characterized by elegant oak tones of vanilla and spice that are married to bright cherry after tones.
Smoky in oak, this substantial wine also offers black cherry, anise and the Russian River Valley's classic character of cola spice. It'll benefit from a lie down; aim for 2017–2019.
This is a gulpable, satisfying wine that shows plenty of ripeness. Full, soft flavors of ripe black cherries are balanced by notes of coffee and chocolate. Long and harmonious finish.
Ripe and forward black-cherry and berry notes are juxtaposed by swathes of green herb and pepper in this neatly balanced Cabernet Sauvignon. Fresh in fruit and acidity, it finishes with bold tannins and integrated tones of smoked nut and spice.
Showing the freshness of the year as much as the structure, this is a ripe wine that's full of fragrant black currants and some tight acidity. It is smooth and soft, the tannins are already integrating, so drink from 2015.
Fruit and tannins harmonize in this ripe, soft wine. Attractive red berry fruits and lively acidity partner with a smooth texture. It's not a wine for aging, and will be ready to drink from 2015.
This has aromas recalling chopped herb, red berry, dill, espresso and camphor. The lean vigorous palate offers sour cherry, cranberry, licorice and roasted coffee bean along with a green note of powdered sage. Grainy tannins grip the finish.
There's very little fruit in this watery, tart wine. It has trace amounts of cherries and rose petals, and is totally dry. It would be pretty nice if it had more concentration.
Exotic, earthy aromas of loamy blackberry, pencil eraser, brown sugar and violet petals lead to a deep but wiry and clipped-feeling palate. The flavor profile is oaky, with spiced berry and cardamom notes leading the charge. A lasting finish is stern and doesn't waver. Drink through 2020.
A steely edge sharpens this perfumed, blossomy Riesling full of ripe white peach and apricot flavors. Dry in style, it's rich and weighty on the palate with a penetrating, powerful finish. Drinks beautifully now, but likely to improve through at least 2021.
A very interesting wine, this is bone dry, complex and smoothly tannic. The cherry, blueberry and red licorice flavors mingle with charred meat and oak notes that change constantly in the glass. Tempranillo's acidity gives it all a nice tart bite. Drink now.
Simple and clean, bright and very food-friendly, this vibrant Dolcetto would pair with a long list of foods from first course pasta to second course meat dishes. There are sweet aromas of berries and cherries and the wine tastes crisp and fresh on the finale.
Each sip of this graceful wine brings a little more depth and flavor. The aromas at first are quiet with just a hint of butter and toasted baguette, but on the palate it's easy to enjoy the pear-tart flavors and creamy texture. Everything seems to build toward the finish, which is long and luxurious.
Mouthfuls of black cherry, raspberry, nutmeg and cinnamon abound in this wine. It boasts a beautiful structure coupled with elegant freshness. Drink now through the next few years.
The best thing about this wonderful Merlot is balance. The winemaker has modulated the blackberry and plum fruit with earthier notes that suggest balsamic, soy-splashed sautéed beef, Portobello mushrooms and coffee. The grippy tannins and acids add a welcome touch of bitterness to the finish. With charm in addition to complexity, this Merlot will drink well for five years.
This bottling explores the more concentrated side of Pinot Noir, with hearty aromas of balsamic fig sauce, cooked berries, clove and rum cake. Roasted blackberry clusters and charred figs show on the sip alongside potent baking spices, making for a rich and heavy expression, although leveling acidity pounds into the finish.
This is one of the best red wines to hail from the Sierra Foothills in memory. It's bone dry and smooth, with the profile of a fine Bordeaux. Shows rich tannins framing black currant, herb, spice and cedar flavors that are complex and delicious. Marks a real step forward for this ambitious winery.
Half Cabernet Sauvignon, and half Syrah, this vintage of Protagonist is entirely different (in both blend and vineyard sources) from the 2007. Sharp and peppery from the cool vintage Syrah, it introduces intriguing scents and accents of cayenne and bitter chocolate. The herbal flavors are more evident than in the other J. Bookwalter releases from 2008, but well blended and balanced.
Light in weight and feel, this tart Chenin leads with bright scents of green apple, plum and lemon peel. A hint of toasted oak dances in the background, adding a touch of depth and spicy character to the close. Linear and direct, this might benefit from a bit more time; try after 2017.
With the next two vintages both damaged by hail, 2012 is the most recent normal crop from Pommard. This structured and solid wine seems to have an excess of wood at this stage, although the ripe red berry fruits do give a more generous character. The tannins, typical of Pommard, kick in—although not enough to spoil the fruitiness. Drink from 2016.
An apple aroma comes with a tinge of mild oak, turning fleshy and less fresh with airing. The palate includes flavors of melon, apple and green herb, while the finish is pithy and citrusy, revealing a touch of green onion.
Savory herbs like lovage and chervil and ripe pear fruit unite to produce a very appetizing, concentrated if uncomplicated wine. Sheer drinkability, spurred on by clean, racy acidity is its hallmark.
For Argentinean Chardonnay this has chops. The nose is fleshy and ripe, with pineapple, candy corn and peach scents. In the mouth, there's verve and balance to support apple, pear, cantaloupe and green-herb flavors. In a purely New World way it manages to blend fleshy fruit and drying white tannins into a pleasurable whole.
Primary fruit flavors of cranberry are at the core here, with medium concentration and acidity. Flavors of leaf and stem come into play and turn the finish slightly bitter. Give this until 2015.
A soft, gentle Cabernet, with flavors of blackberries, cherries, raspberries, cassis and sweet oak. Drink this rich, forward wine now.
Rich in citrus and tropical fruit flavors, but superbly dry and crisp in cool-climate acidity, with a wonderful, stony minerality. Comes down squarely on the dry, steely side of the Chardonnay spectrum, but no less complex and interesting.
This smells toasty, spicy and nicely oaky. Rich and plummy, it tastes blackberry-like, jammy and opulent with hints of clove and cassis. Stylish and polished, it's big in flavors and full in body, with soft tannins. It's a sophisticated wine that offers plenty of enjoyment.
Wild berries, cranberries and pungent herbaceousness characterize this Barrel Select Pinot Noir. It seems a little light at first, then gathers itself in a focused, spicy midpalate that nicely integrates the fruit and herbs.
Gianni Gagliardo is producing excellent results from the estate's newly refurbished winery. This expression from the Serre cru shows elegance and harmony, especially in how its aromas of black fruit, tar, licorice and white truffle come together. Drying tannins and firm structure promise long aging.
This is a structured wine with firm tannins, showing a good balance of red berry and cherry juice flavors. It is rich and likely to soften over the next year into something warm and fruity.
Bright and fruity, this is an apple and crisp green-fruit-flavored wine. There is a hint of the maturity to come, giving a light toastiness while the fruit remains crisp and refreshing. Drink now.
This wine offers fruit-forward aromas of raspberries, plum and cranberry. It drinks off dry (10g/L residual sugar) with abundant red fruit flavors and a light squeeze of tannins leading to herb flavors on the finish.
There's a subtle yet thorough menthol character to the nose of this single-vineyard wine from the west end of the appellation, alongside hibiscus juice. It's tinglingly acidic on the palate yet ripe and juicy at the same time, like mild cherry juice meeting up with sassafras.
Aroma of lemon zest, acacia, yellow apple and a whiff of almond lead the nose. On the palate, chopped herbs adds interest to pineapple, lime and yellow pear. Vibrant acidity and racy bubbles offset the fruit flavors while a hint of lemon drop backs up the finish.
A dense nose of savory spices, molasses and dark chocolate give this affordable red blend added appeal. Cloves, pepper, leather and a touch of smoke on the palate give it a masculine edge. Tannins are firm but friendly. Pair with grilled ribs, sausage.
This is an elegant wine that opens with aromas of blue flower, cassis, ginger, tar, cola and licorice. There are blasts of fresh mint and spice on the polished, streamlined finish.
A pretty pale-salmon color, this wine offers appealing aromas of orange peel, strawberry and wet stone. The palate is dry, crisp and clean with mouthwatering acids, a beautiful sense of texture and a lingering finish. It's thoroughly delicious.
This bold, intense expression of the variety entices with an exuberant nose of white pepper, clove and cardamom scents, a spark of pine needle fragrance just underneath. Tingly acidity provides freshness and added succulence to its otherwise rich texture and black cherry decadence.
This wine is put together from multiple vineyard sources, including the well-known Morelli Lane and Widdoes, all farmed by the Duttons. Larger in production than many of the vineyard-designates, it offers baked bread and juicy overtones of cranberry-raspberry layered atop luxuriously toasted oak. It'll show well at the table.
Like in past vintages, this wine presents very vibrant aromas of apple and dried apricot followed by red berry fruit and spice. It shows a traditional, compact style that is firm and bright without being too dense or heavy.
Here's a plump and very fruit forward Ripasso with aromas of dried current berry, cherry and an interesting green element that recalls garden herbs or dried hay. It delivers a deliciously thick and chewy texture with soft, velvety tannins.  —M.L.
Another winner from this undervalued winery. Consistent with past vintages, this one is ripely fruity, with tasty flavors of apples and peaches and a rich overlay of vanilla and smoke from oak. Crisp acidity keeps it clean and vibrant on the palate.
This unique old vine Chardonnay vineyard makes cool-climate grape flavors as interesting and complex as any fruit bomb. Spring herb, light floral, citrus and grapefruit combine in a delicate, elegant wine. It's Chablis without the chalk; plenty of acid.
This is a pepper- and apple-flavored wine with refreshing acidity that cuts through its richness. Using grapes sourced from the Kogl Vineyard, this shows perfumed ripeness and intense crispness. Screwcap.
There is not much in the way of fruit in this wine, which veers into questionable flavors of burnt mushrooms.
This refreshing wine from the Seze family of Fronsac is light, crisp and packed with fruit. Crisp with citrus flavors it is ready to drink now.
Light and delicate, yet flavorful and perfectly ripe, this elegant wine taps into the ethereal side of the grape. It's tart and somewhat chocolaty, yet neither acid nor barrel flavors obscure the oh-so-pretty raspberry fruit.
Smooth and supple, with loads of juicy, ripe blackberry and plum flavors, this full-bodied, luscious red is another great bang-for-your-buck Georgian offering. Big, bold tannins persist on the palate that's laced with tasty, lingering notes of coffee and dark chocolate. Perfect with winter braises and stews.
88-90 Barrel sample. The wood is the dominant character here, the fruit hinting at herbacousness, but forced behind all that toast.
This dry Pinot Noir is a little ungenerous, offering modest sour cherry candy and wintergreen flavors. It's also a little bitter, tasting almost like press wine.
Woodsy cedar and spice tones swirl into layers of vanilla cream in this intensely oaky, yet enticing Chardonnay. Brisk lemon-lime acidity and fresh apple and pear notes freshen the midpalate.
Strong in every sense, with ripe pineapple, lemon and peach flavors and strong oak. Lacks subtlety, but it's crisp in acidity and shows a nice streak of minerals. Ready now.
This is the winery's second release of this 100% Syrah from the esteemed Stagecoach Vineyard. It's enormously rich and opulent in blackberry, black cherry jam, chocolate, anise and pepper flavors. There's plenty of new French oak, but the wine easily shoulders it. It's a delicious sipper.
A re-release from the 1995 vintage, this is a wine that shows exceptional richness. It also shows maturity and toastiness, a style that historically has appealed to American and British Champagne collectors. But it is not just for collecting, because this wine is delicious, its secondary flavors of hazelnuts, toast and acidity making it an excellent food wine.
This Chardonnay has depth, starting with its unfolding nose of ripe Chardonnay fruit, minerals, hazelnut and citrus. The palate offers flavors of pear, citrus and grapefruit, its character refreshing and fruity but somewhat complex. An impressive white that can handle richer dishes.
Lightly minty and peachy in aroma, this wine also delivers rich butter, vanilla and pear flavors and a smooth texture on the palate. A butterscotch note lingers on the finish.
Struck flint and stones add dimension to abundantly fleshy melon and grapefruit notes in Red Newt's Circle Riesling. Semidry, with a hint of smoked nuts and lemony fresh acidity, it finishes on a deliciously bitter grapefruit-pith note.
A clean-cut top note of citrus hovers above the otherwise still-closed nose. The palate comes in with a concentrated richness that is as much sustained by residual sweetness as it is by sheer force of fruit: candied lemon and orange, juicy pear, ripe mirabelle and yellow peach. There also is a zesty spicy pithiness on the midpalate that frames and guides the wine alongside invigorating lemon freshness that lets this finish off dry despite the richness. This is yet to unfold fully. Lovely now, sure to improve. Drink 2020—2035.
Full bodied with a creamy texture, this is a ripe, pear-flavored wine. It has weight, richness and warmth that contrasts a crisp edge of citrus acidity. With just a touch of spice, it's made to be enjoyed with Asian food. Screwcap.
Golden hay in color, this fragrant, vineyard-designated estate wine offers floral jasmine on the nose before delving into notes of minerality and savory herb. Substantial on the palate without becoming overbearing, it's both elegant and memorable.
An elegant, pretty Pinot to drink now. Dry and brisk in acidity, it has a nice, silky texture framing forward raspberry, red currant and oak flavors.

Made with Traminer and Chardonnay grapes, this luminous Brut sparkling wine opens with floral aromas of jasmine and honeysuckle backed by peach and yellow fruit. It's a simple but smart little wine that would pair with appetizers.
Not your usual dark and superripe California wine, this is light in color with a brick-brown edge. It smells lightly spicy, almost like salt and pepper, and tastes dry, beefy and also a bit like raspberries and black tea. It's a great change of pace and very interesting to taste.
Wonderfully smooth in the mouth, all satin and velvet, and so dry and crisp, it makes your mouth water. Good flavors, too, suggesting freshly picked wild blackberries, anise and black pepper. There's just a trace of some unripe fruit, however, that turns vegetal. Drink now.
The blend is 50% Grenache, 40% Shiraz and 10% Mourvèdre, and it delivers a creamy mouthful of bright berry flavors. A hint of chocolate adds another dimension, while the mouthfeel is lush without being overly soft. Drink now–2012.
Spicy, toasty, full-bodied and fruity, this is a wine that is packed with plums, fresh red fruits, and a great burst of ripe acidity. Delicious and very accessible.
Tarry, black-fruit aromas show a touch of oaky vanilla. This has a medium-bodied palate feel along with stalky, slightly horsey flavors of berry fruits and plum. A loamy finish sets out strong and settles on mild earthiness.
The tawny rim of this ruby-red Cabernet Sauvignon hints towards signs of early evolution. It's maturity is more evident on the palate with somewhat demure flavors of dark cherry, cedar and herb accented by touches of autumn leaf, soil and mushroom. Drink up now.
This mélange of mostly Viognier and Chardonnay also holds smaller percentages of Sauvignon Blanc, Symphony and Muscat. Incognito spent no time in oak. With a lively taste of orange blossom, it could almost be mistaken for Gewürztraminer because of its distinct mixture of floral and spice.
The 2008 vintage produced some truly outstanding red wines in Washington, if your palate runs to higher acid, bright fruit styles. This is a perfect example; it's loaded with raspberries, strawberries and pretty berry fruit aromas. The acids prop it up perfectly; it's front loaded but has the balance and tightness to cellar for a few years. But really—drink it young.
Heavy and ripe, but also floral and rich, with satisfying, intriguing aromatics. Draws you in with smoky notes of boysenberry, black plum and bitter chocolate, and then seals the deal with a firm, balanced, moderately tannic finish. Imported by Austral Wines.
The winery's ode to Châteauneuf-du-Pape, Hudson Vineyard provides 90% Grenache and 10% Syrah for this complex blend, perfumed in violet and vanilla. Leathery and fruity in equal measure, it features prominent raspberries, while the finish offers a shake or two of cinnamon.
Yeasty, with beery aromatics, this has slightly sweet, tangy flavors of grapefruit and soda pop. Give it more time in the bottle to meld together.
Inky and dense, with plum-cake aromas along with nuances of tree bark and nutmeg. The more time you give this ripe, tannic red, the more it'll offer. The fruit is pure and ripe, and the tannins are anything but meek. On the finish, root beer, chocolate and vanilla notes add some complexity and sweetness. The fruit is 61% Columbia Valley (Wash.) and 39% southern Oregon, and the whole is a fine yet brawny offering.
The aromas of dark fruit, mineral, smoked meat, coffee and spice are brooding, not yet fully revealing their charms. Elegant yet penetrating, the fruit and savory flavors coat the palate from end to end with supple-feeling fruit flavors and a lengthy finish.
Hearty, full-bodied, definitely rich and deeply colored. The chocolate and oak aromas lead to plenty of ripe blackberry and boysenberry flavors that come out on the palate and linger on the finish. It tastes big and tannic, yet the gushing fruit flavors balance everything out, and the overall impression is smooth and polished.
It’s hard to keep the Chardonnay from getting ripe in California, and so this bubbly has strong, fruity notes from the citrus and peach-accented aromas through the peachy finish. Of course there’s toast, and the rough scour of acidity. It’s quite clean and refreshing, but definitely a warm-climate sparkling wine.
A spicy blast of new oak flavor meets bright, juicy fruit in this medium-bodied wine. It's solidly structured, firm on the palate, with good concentration to go with its athletic build. It will pair well with lamb chops or roast duck breast.
An excellent Col Solare; the best yet. It has suppleness and structure, with a panoply of fruits, from cassis to slightly candied cherries. The barrel notes are here in proportion, adding toast and coffee and chocolate, and the tannins are firm and polished. A strong core leads into a tight, confident finish.
Riserva gli Angeli is a beautiful Brunello with plump richness and long-lasting flavors of red fruit, exotic spice, leather and tobacco. Thanks to excellent growing conditions, this lucky vintage shows wonderfully rich texture in the mouth.
This is impressively dark, with dense but grapy fruit flavors right out front. The mouthfeel is sharp and spicy, and it thins out surprisingly in the middle, given the color and rather high alcohol. Sappy acids and raspy tannins carry it through the finish.
Coming in at a low (for Washington) alcohol level for this variety, this 100% Grenache shows light aromas of mint and other herbs with elusive raspberry and plum accents. It's medium bodied with an elegant, supple feel, showing little obvious new-oak influence to the red fruit flavors. A very intriguing wine where the texture plays a starring role in the show.
From an interior subregion of Hawke's Bay, this shows classic oak-aged Pinot aromas of cherries, brown sugar and baking spices. It's medium in weight, with a suede-like texture and a savory, mocha-tinged finish. This is already showing a hint of bricking at the rim, so drink it over the next few years.
Made from 68% Pinot Noir and 32% Syrah, this ethereal wine is pillowy in candied aromas of lemon and lime. Pinkish-copper in color, it's light, bright and succulent, and then finishes dry and with brevity.
Coming from five different Syrah vineyards across the Columbia Valley, this wine offers high quality and value. It conveys black olives, iron, an earthy funk, chocolate and floral accents. The coffee and earth flavors are rich while still showing exquisite restraint.
This is quite rich and complex, and while it's not without flaws, it shows tremendous promise for future vintages. The wine is dry and full-bodied, with ripe blackberry, smoky leather, dark chocolate and white pepper flavors. But the best thing is the tannic structure, so fine and dusty, almost Napa-esque in quality.
“Roble” means oak and there's no shortage of oak on this youngster. The nose smells almost like melted cheese and bread at first, but then it settles and lets out subtle leather and fruit aromas. The palate is juicy and fresh, with forward black cherry and plum flavors. Definitely lively, and with no tricks up its sleeve.
This sweet-tasting, fruity wine features a delicious, fragrant, juicy blackberry flavor. Its tannins are solid, but they are secondary to the generous fruits.
The Four Boys bottling has been particularly successful for Steve Pessagno, and this big, voluptuous 2010 is his best since 2006. Dry and full bodied, it has rich flavors of red and dark berries, currants, Dr. Pepper and cinnamon, with hints of dark chocolate and red licorice. It's quite tannic, and obviously needs to age. Best after 2018.
Subdued aromas of pear, toast and a yeasty note of bread dough lead the nose. The bracing palate offers Golden Delicious apple, lime and toasted walnut alongside sharp acidity. It finishes on a somewhat bitter note.
This wine may be darker and oakier than Maipu's regular '07 Malbec, but it isn't substantially better. It has heavy black-fruit aromas and a sweet, clammy palate of jammy blackberry. Caramel and chocolate flavors make the finish thick and sweet.
The Muscat Canelli in the blend really stands out, offering tangerine aromas and flavors. But additional fruit and spice complexities are offered by Sauvignon Blanc and Viognier, among other varieties. Crisply acidic and dry, this is an outstanding white wine, and a versatile one at the table. Sommeliers, buy this by the case.
57% To Kalon. Gorgeously fresh bouquet. Blackcurrants, oak, cocoa, buttery caramel and char. Drinking really young, firm, fresh. Very dry, balanced, not a powerful wine but elegant, harmonious. Light and pretty. Now-2012.
This fruit-driven, minerally Malbec hails from the Altamira section of Mendoza's Uco Valley. Blueberry, cassis and stony aromas feed into a deep, pure palate with plenty to offer. Flavors of cassis, blackberry, peppercorn and exotic spices finish with moderate tannins and flavors of fig and black pepper. Drink through 2019.
Acquired in 2006 by Alain-Dominique Perrin of Lagrézette, Clos Marguerite is situated on the top terrace above the Lot. It's a perfumed, polished wine, ripe and smooth in texture despite the attendant tannins. They give a dry core to the generous black fruits and acidity, allowing the wine to be structured as well as opulent. Drink from 2017.
Wood aging gives this wine's aroma its eucalyptus character. That perfume follows through to the finely structured palate, where oak flavors balance its delicious black plum fruit. It's warm, ripe and stylish. Drink from 2020.
Woody, with dill and buttery oak along with toast, char and distant berry and plum. The palate offers raspberry, cherry and a blast of lollipop sweetness. Finishes with medium tannins, milk chocolate and a snap of tang. Impressive but affordable for Maipo Cabernet. Imported by Terra Andina.
Opens with vegetal aromas that turn harsh and dry in the mouth, with a finish of sweet cherry cough medicine.
A lean but lucid nose shows piquant floral scents. The palate on this Garnacha-Syrah is choppy and abrupt, with high acidity and rubbery tannins. Medicinal red plum and red-currant flavors finish with a rubbery grip.
Dry and earthy, with flavors of black currants and herbs that finish tartly tannic. Clean, but lacks richness. Drink now.
A solidly structured wine, it is both elegant and intensely powerful. It is disclosing its fruitiness slowly, at the moment dense and concentrated. A restrained edge provides complexity and balance. It will need aging, so don't drink before 2022.
This light, fresh and crisp wine presents cut-grass aromas and citrus flavors. It's a fragrant, bright wine ready for immediate drinking.
Red and black cherry aromas mark the nose of this wine. The palate is similarly primary and vibrant, with supple ripe berry and cherry notes. On the finish, the freshness and taut structure become apparent. This is irresistibly juicy right now but will evolve. Drink now–2023.
This is firm, with a dense dark-plum flavor and craggy tannins. It is very rich, although its acidity sustains some freshness. Ripe and juicy, this can age for 3-4 years.
This well-made, ripe and fruity wine has soft tannins that are already well integrated with the red-berry fruits. Acidity keeps it all fresh and suggests the wine could age over the medium-term. Drink from 2018.
A blast of clean, ripe citrus, peach and pear fruit greets you from this well-made, if simple, wine. There are vanilla and smoke elements from wood. It's a little soft, and a tad off-dry, but if you need a case of something white to quench the throats of party-goers who aren't real particular, this is the ticket.
Hedonis is a beautiful blend of Nero d'Avola (70%) and Syrah, with a soft, velvety feel and bold berry flavors. It offers endnotes of cassis, almond, tobacco and savory cured meat.
This opens with faint honeysuckle and white stone fruit aromas. The informal, lively palate offers green apple, peach and citrus hints, alongside bright acidity.
A juicy blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, this opens with aromas of blackberry, plum, blue flower and a whiff of exotic spice. The velvety approachable palate offers fleshy black cherry, licorice, ground pepper and a hint of nutmeg alongside fine-grained tannins. Enjoy over the next several years.
Chardonnay in this sparkler, and it shows in the fresh peach and Meyer lemon flavors. The wine is a little softer in acidity than Korbel's other bubblies, and also a little sweet, which makes it somewhat cloying.
This wine's chopped herb, dark culinary spice, eucalyptus and oak aromas unfold in the glass. The firm palate offers raw cherry, ground clove, star anise and tobacco set against close-grained tannins that grip the finish.
The grapes are from north of St. Helena, on the valley floor. They were fully ripened in this hot vintage, and have fleshy, forward flavors of red and black cherries, coffee, orange zest and cocoa. This is an interesting wine, lighter in body than Cabernet Sauvignon, but with depth, complexity and quite a bit of elegance.
Here is your Pinot if you prefer elegance over power. This delicate wine opens with a heady mix of rose petals, orange and lemon peel and raspberry fruit. The raspberry flavors linger gracefully, buoyed by citrusy acidity. The length is impressive.
From a single vineyard now designated as a monopole, this wine by winemaker Bill Brousseau, who designed the vineyard, and vintners Rob Jensen and Kirk Williams shows minty herbs and tangerine oil on the nose. There is great restraint on the palate that walks a razor's edge of balance, with flavors of tart Key lime pith and riper orange blossom.
Gritty, uric, green aromas come in front of a round palate with little cut. Vegetal, bitter flavors of bell pepper and grapefruit finish with another wave of bitterness.
This is an herbal, almost throwback style of Carmenère. The nose delivers a blast of tomato leaf along with a rooty, herbal aroma of red fruit suggestive of pizza. The palate is tight and smacks hard with tannins, while the core flavors are roasted and burnt, with a baked berry note and an earthy nuttiness.
A serious Cab with a medium-to-full disposition. Starts with aromas of loam, rubber and tobacco, then comes an active palate with zesty acids and a juicy overall feel. Tastes of black fruits and raspberry, with coffee, mocha and herbal accents. Thick on the finish, with tannic clamp and oaky residue.
Right now this is not typically soft and lush like a cult Cab, but hard in tannins, with minerality like little particles of granite. Buried deep down is a pirate's treasure of ripe, intense blackberry fruit. New oak, to the tune of 94%, doesn't cloud the wine, suggesting this blend's its intensity and concentration. The wine is comprised of all five classic Bordeaux varieties, sourced throughout Sonoma County. Clearly this is one for the cellar; drink after 2018.
This is starting to develop some secondary fruit aromas, richly suggestive of fresh-baked strawberry tarts, with a hint of the Cayuse funk underscoring the complexity. Penetrating and dense, this is both powerful and elegant, with precision and pungency. The liquid minerality provides a firm foundation and elevates the texture. This is a unique style of Grenache, that ripens slowly into a lingering finish with dried herbs and tanned leather.
Gorgeously ripe and rich, this powerful wine has a dark structure and layer after layer of juicy black fruits. It's still young and the mineral side of the wine is still showing, but its future is looking good with that beautiful fruitiness. Drink from 2018.
Intensely sweet and super-drinkable, this Sherry-style wine has a light, creamy texture with potent flavors of white chocolate, raspberry honey, tangerine zest, vanilla crème brûlée and dusty spices. It's a gorgeous wine, a perfect way to end a great dinner with dainty little dessert pastries.
This wine utilizes 40% neutral oak, 40% stainless steel and 20% new French barrels, and is fermented with native yeast. It's a deep, vibrant gold color, sporting sexy aromas of pineapple, pear and peach. The palate is fully ripe, round and forward, with luscious fruit flavors throughout.
This big, ripe wine is well polished with a juicy, fragrant character from the spiced plums. The wood aging has resulted in deceptively soft tannins, and the delicious black fruits are still upfront. This wine could age for 2–3 years.
88—90 Barrel sample. The second wine of Valandraud, a wine that goes more for tannins than its big brother. The fruit is less obvious, less attractive.
This dry, darkly tannic wine is all about structure and firmness. It has weight, but the fruit is submerged under the wood and the solid tannins.
Lean and minerally, this Chard offers lime and white peach flavors that finish bone dry and clean. It's not a rich wine, but it is very elegant, with a good scour of bracing acidity.
This is described as a country-style wine because of its rugged tannins and angular, rough mouthfeel. The deeply plummy flavors are ripe, but very dry. The biggest problem may be the acids, which are very low. You long for more crispness and life, something to offset the fruitiness.
This entry-level wine of the Saint André de Figuière range is pretty impressive in itself. It has a rounded, smooth character that is lifted by attractive red berry acidity and a nervy, mineral texture. Balanced acidity completes the picture.
Rich cassis and chocolate aromas and flavors are offset by wisps of green bell pepper that comes and goes—one sniff it's there, the next it's not. Displays good richness and warm, supple tannins but may be too “green” for some consumers.
A lovely, heady lift of lemon, peach and passion fruit dances on the nose. This rich sweet-fruited tropicality is played out fully on the medium-sweet palate where the passion fruit swirls tartly alongside sweet ripe generous peach. It is the passion-fruit aroma and tartness that gives this a real edge. This not only has sweetness but a real tropical thrill. It's a very concentrated, pure-fruited wine with lots of promise. Drink 2017–2027.
This wine has a richness that borders on candied, a celebration of ripe raspberry and cherry with medium weight and body around strong streaks of tannin.
The nose does not want to give too much away, apart from delicacy and ripe yellow pear. The palate is ripe and rounded and has a distinct yeasty, almost nutty savoriness. Pepper then makes an entrance and stays right there to linger beautifully.
From a vineyard holding in the midst of prime Pinot Noir country, Maffei intrigues in ripe, hearty plum, black cherry and kir aromas and flavors. The tannins are soft and nicely managed, accented by notes of nutmeg and black pepper.
Fruit sourced from three vineyards—Lange Estate, Freedom Hill and Yamhill—has been artfully blended into an aromatic wine, showing a pleasing mix of black cherry, cola and cocoa flavors. Open and broadly accessible, this is a balanced and quite delicious drink which will be best enjoyed over the next few years.
Fruity and floral aromas of blackberry and violet lead the nose along with a trace of kitchen spice. The easygoing palate presents juicy black cherry, spiced blueberry and a white pepper note alongside polished tannins. Enjoy through 2017.
Quite aromatic on first pour, this wine shows green peppercorn, violets, earth, smoked meat and savory aromas. The fruit and savory flavors are generous, showing length and depth.
Aromas of menthol, espresso and pressed rose take center stage. The medium-bodied palate shows spiced cranberry, pomegranate, roasted coffee bean, anise and a rather green note of powdered sage. Assertive close-grained tannins clench the finish. Give the tannins a few more years to unwind then drink.
A bit lean in the mouth and short on the finish, but there's some nice red fruit notes with accents of foliage and spice.
Boasts a flamboyant bouquet of blackberries and black pepper upon opening, then settles down into a medium-bodied wine with nice density and flavor persistence. There's no question that it's well balanced and has a lovely nose, but this is not a great wine, merely very good.
First made in 2006, this succulent luscious Chardonnay is all about minerality. It's got a rich core of butterscotch and the seemingly endless layers of subtle flavors that biodynamic farming can bring. It spends 18 months on the lees prior to bottling. Drink now through 2028.
This Port from the organically farmed Casal dos Jordões certainly has pure fruit flavors. But the main impression is of a green, herbal character with bitter chocolate which spoil the balance. The spirit could be better integrated, as well.
This is a succulent wine with its light tannins and juicy red-berry fruits. It is fresh with a mineral edge as well as spice and balanced acidity. The aftertaste is smooth and soft. It is ready to drink for the pleasure of its fruit.
This is a structured wine that shows both solid tannins and juicy red-fruit acidity. It's a rich but balanced wine with a ripe aftertaste. Drink from 2015.
There isn't enough fruit on this high flier to give it the unqualified seal of approval. In fact, for $50 it has its issues, namely a nose of boot polish and grainy oak. Seems like the fruit is fading and what's left besides some light raspberry is unabsorbed oak and thin, grabby tannins. Not a bad wine per se but not a big success either.
Although priced considerably less than Testarossa's single-vineyard bottlings, this Chard is nearly as good. It's rich with tropical fruits, vanilla custard, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors, all brightened by crisp acidity.
Made from Caladoc, a grape variety created in 1958 by crossing Grenache and Malbec, this medium-bodied rosé is restrained in style, with ginger and citrus notes accenting strawberry fruit. It's dry and refreshing on the finish. Drink now.
Named after the French word for inhabitants of the Loire Valley, this crisp, medium-sweet wine has a light caramel touch over crushed strawberry fruits. It is ready to drink.
Aromatically brooding, this suggests dry chocolate, violets, brown stems, herbs, black pepper and smoked meat. It's restrained in style with pure, tart blue fruit flavors and a light squeeze of tannins that need additional time in bottle to settle in fully. Enjoy it at the dinner table to see it at its best.
This is rich, structured and full-bodied. It bursts with superripe Merlot, darkly tannic and dense. Rich berry and black plum fruits add their weight to this concentrated wine. Drink from 2016.
There's a burst of white pepper that escapes just after you pop the cork, although it airs to blackberry pie. This is a young, tannic wine, too tight to drink now. The peppery, herbal side suggests against long-term cellaring, but it should soften and sweeten by 2006.
Soft fruit that shows velvet tannins and a full, ripe red berry character. There are milk chocolate and bitter cherry flavors and very fresh acidity, all comfortably integrated, just finishing with an edge of pepper.
This block-designate wine shows flamboyant aromas of red cherry, cola, purple flowers and light caramel. The palate offers an amazingly cohesive and zesty experience, combining piquant cranberry and tart raspberry with slate-driven minerality and a persistent woody spice. The texture is soft, but lifted by strong acidity.
From the elegant and bright 2006 vintage, this shows aromas of spice, red fruit, leather, cola and cedar. The palate is attractive, showing tight, polished tannins and lively fruit.
This is exactly what Merlot should taste like, and you get it for a pretty nice price. Dry and velvety, it has immediately likeable flavors of red cherries, smoky bacon, violets, peppery spices and a lovely coat of sandalwood. Drink this lush, smooth wine now.
This Syrah offers bright tones of leather, cured meat and blackberry. Smooth and long-lasting, the palate boasts loads of bright berries.
Estate-grown and bottled, this is the winery owner's ode to his mother, and the highest-end white he makes. Deeply layered in fennel and oak, it is a hearty, generous expression of ripe apple and wild vanilla, softly textured, that will benefit from time in the cellar, through 2020.
With grapes from Yountville, this Bordeaux blend, which is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon, has a very fine structure. It's firm in tannins and acidity, with a bracing minerality. The flavors are already quite advanced, suggesting jammy cherries, blackberries and cassis. Drink now for sheer deliciousness, after decanting.
There's a dullness to this wine, which flirts with the idea of plum and cherry flavor yet gets somewhat bogged down in marshmallow. Light bodied, it presents with more ripe sweetness than it may actually have.
The aromas in this wine are bright, with notes of herb, tire rubber and red currant, with the oak influence dialed back. The fruit flavors are lighter styled, direct and pure, going down easy with blue-fruit flavors on the finish. It's a pleasant easy drinker.
Decent, with ripe flavors of cherries and spice, dry tannins and good acidity. Yes, it's a common wine, made for everyday consumption, but you can't drink expensive stuff every day. This will do in a pinch, or for your next block party.
Lightly herbal, tight and dry, this is pure Cabernet from a warm year. Nonetheless it is austere almost to the point of metallic, and the fruit carries a lot of herbal notes, with a hint of green bean.
This firmly built wine is big in flavor and bolstered by a broad layer of fine-grained tannins. It tastes like blackberries, cranberries and dark chocolate. This wine should improve and soften a bit after 2019.
This Pinot is from the winery's only Eola-Amity Hills AVA vineyard. The palate brings distinctive herbal accents around brambly berry-fruit flavors. Rich seams of caramel and chocolate smooth the finish.
Herbal fynbos, sweet grass and lime leaf aromas are upfront on the nose of this wine, followed by supporting notes of Anjou pear, honeydew rind and honeysuckle. It's attractive and easy drinking, with refreshing citrus and green apple flavors that finish crisp and clean. Drink now.
This blend of Alfrochiero, Tinta Roriz and Touriga Nacional is a steal at the $7 price. The meaty, peppery, blackberry nose and bouncy, medium-weight palate makes this wine a ringer for a good Côtes-du-Rhône, at a fraction of the price. Even shows good length on the peppery finish. Drink now–2008. Imported by Aidil Wines & Liquor Inc.
Full-bodied and heavy in the Loring style, an extracted wine filled with exciting fruit and berry flavors, but lacking the delicacy and finesse you expect from Pinot Noir.
A big-time dud given Torres' track record in Chile. This wine, no matter how you cut it, is flat, vegetal and smells and tastes of corn. There's no pulse and very strange aromas and core flavors. Way out on the fringe as far as Chardonnay is concerned.
Made entirely from Trebbiano di Soave, this bright wine has a subdued nose that reveals white floral notes, tree fruit and mineral. The creamy, savory palate is much more expressive, delivering tart apples, ripe pear, white spice, mint and mineral alongside crisp acidity.
Juicy blackberry aromas are spiced up by dried-herb, black-pepper and vanilla-bean notes. On the palate, dark berries and toast are accented by earth and green tobacco, and chewy, gritty tannins. Taut red fruit rolled in white and black pepper sums it up. 84% Cabernet Sauvignon, 14% Merlot, 1% Cabernet Franc, 1% Petit Verdot.
A little candied and jumpy on the nose, with floral, grapey aromas. The palate is wide and stocky, with grabby tannins that turn the flavors of bold berry and plum a bit thick. Fruity and extracted on the finish; good wine but needs some refinement to match the big size.
This is a bold and powerful wine with distinctive green notes that recall dried grass, black pepper and spice. It also has bitter chocolate, cardamom and cumin and its tannins are so strong, they literally leave your palate parched and dry.
It's a pleasure to find a sipping wine that gracefully displays a mix of honeysuckle blossoms, light apple, pear and peach, and a gentle wrap of firming acids. Elegant right through the finish.
This lush, ripe Syrah has its precision points across the bouquet—namely graphite, mint and pure black-fruit scents. On the palate, this blends juicy liveliness with layered richness. Flavors of blackberry, dark plum, chocolate, mixed spices and fresh herbs add up to one yummy, well-oaked, balanced wine. Drink through 2018.
87–89. Barrel sample. Jammy in character—perhaps attributable to the 26% of Petit Verdot in the blend—this wine is soft and smooth, but already developing well.
Rose, violet, black raspberry, wild cherry and espresso aromas lead the nose. The juicy fruit palate is accented with notes of sweet cake spices and supported by lithe tannins. Enjoy soon.
This exceptional Sangiovese's aromas are true to the variety, with forest berry, blue flower and warm earthy tones that wash over its solid structure. However, most of the action is on the finish where the wine excels in terms of length.
92-94 Barrel sample. A wine that shows the ripe fruit of the year, but that seems to keep enough freshness. Bold and rich, very spicy wood on top of peach fruit flavors.
Grillo tends to oxidize easily during winemaking. Timpune does in fact show distant aromas of butterscotch and caramel that fit squarely within the aromatic profile of the grape. Otherwise, the wine ends with fresh peach, citrus and pineapple.
One of the producer's signature varieties, this impresses in its nutty gamy overview that recalls the sensations and smells of an Italian deli. Rich red fruit makes for a juicy core built around substantial tannins that become supple on the palate. The finish is about black pepper.
Hints of lemon peel rise shyly from the glass, becoming more intense with air. The palate is dry, buffered and has a savory undertow of wild thyme that interplays beautifully with sumptuous peach notes and that almost textured, zesty acidity that unites everything and brings extended, refreshing length.
Aromas of toasted nut, vanilla nougat, orange, spice and lemon lead this sophisticated sip from Loel. On the palate, spice, smoke, nut and citrus flavors intermingle in an elegant but assertive package. This is an appealing and historic treat.
Made from a blend of five indigenous grapes from Abruzzo and Puglia (Montepulciano, Primitivo, Sangiovese, Negroamaro and Malvasia), this is a soft and luscious wine, with generous aromas of ripe fruit, spice and moist tobacco. There's a sweet spot on the finish followed by thickly extracted but soft tannins.
Crisp, juicy acidity and tangy flavors of Meyer lemons and limes make this wine immediately appealing. Partial barrel fermentation adds a touch of toast and cream, but a keen racy freshness really is the hallmark.
Earth and cola notes accent a true Burgundian nose of rustic raspberry and herbs. This is a stylish, reserved wine—one that sits nicely on the palate and glides down smooth while still holding its cards tight to the vest. It should blossom and soften in about three or four years; now it has everything going for it.
The cherry cola, herb, menthol and barrel-spice aromas seem a bit more evolved than their age might indicate. The palate is on the lighter side of medium bodied, with plump tannins providing support.
This is a candied, slightly sweet Pinot Noir, pretty rustic all around. Its acidity and sugary finish give it a raspberry and cherry, sweet and sour taste.
Forward aromas of savory herbs and fynbos add character to the black cherry and berry core of this wine. It's well balanced, with medium tannins, ample acidity and a crushed-satin texture. Soft hints of toasted oak and mocha unfold on the medium-length close.
This fruit-forward Syrah is brimming with aromas and flavors of raspberry, boysenberry and blueberry, all graced with a hint of vanilla cream. The mouthfeel boasts a satiny texture, with fine tannins, and the flavors evolve from fleshy fruit to spice and toasty oak. Drink now–2016.
Sourced entirely from the Carabella vineyard, this offers a pleasing blend of citrus, pineapple and pear fruit, with a backing of honey-laced lemon tea. It's delicious and ready to drink.
This has an unusually deep color and a smoky rim. Aromas resemble chocolate and balsamic, while flavors are rich, smoky and savory. The texture is thick with tannins that leave a drying impression on the finish.
When this wine was launched in 1987, it was the first in the region to be fermented in wood. That wood aging has continued. This latest release (Sauvignon Blanc, Mauzac and Muscadelle) by Jean-Marc Balaran gives a beautiful wine that is finely balanced between tightly crisp fruit and smoother, creamy spice and wood flavors. The wine is ready to drink.
Tastes like the grapes got a little too ripe in the heat, resulting in a distinct raisiny taste that would be more appropriate to Port than a Cabernet Sauvignon. The alcohol is nearly 15% by volume. Hard to see this Cab aging well.
Toasty but also pickled, with a lot of wood spice and other oak-based aromas and flavors. At one moment the wine seems to have the right stuff: citrus and some length. But upon further inspection the fruit turns foxy and shows itself to be overripe. Loses steam as it unfolds. Imported by North American Beverage Group.
Don't look for fat, buttery stuff here. This wine is as streamlined as a steel girder. With high acidity and a firm minerality, it hits the palate clean and spicy. But once it warms up, wham! Exotic kiwis, limes and mangoes take over as well as the buttercream effects of barrel fermentation. Fantastic concentration, and probably good for a decade.
Here's a bright, tart, wonderfully drinkable young Sauvignon Blanc with some real complexity. It's savory in citrus, gooseberry, green apple and vanilla flavors, with just a touch of creamy oak.
This has flavors of cherry and blackberry jam, cola and spice. It's crisp in acidity and dry, as Pinot should be. This is direct and polished; it's not likely to get better with age, so drink now.
From a tremendous site sourced by the producer for multiple vintages, this wine shows a charismatic match of winemaker and grapes, beginning with a lean, bright entry that's smooth and rounded on the palate. A medium body doesn't skimp on complexity or richness though, the wine a tribute to balance and elegance in fennel-dusted ripeness.
Bricco Barone is a smokey, meaty expression of Nebbiolo with bold aromas of black fruit, prune, dried tobacco leaf and finely milled white pepper. This pretty wine ends with a masculine blast of earthy, dusty tones.
Aromas of fragrant spring flower, white peach and a whiff of banana take center stage. Reflecting the nose, the bright palate offers golden apple and hint of candied citrus drop alongside fresh acidity.
A Chardonnay that did not go through malolactic fermentation and was aged in 20% new French oak, this is bristling in acidity and crispness, with a suggestion of lemon and vanilla wafer on the palate. The finish remains crisp though abbreviated.
Perhaps not one of the big successes of Chocapalha, this is a wine that seems to bring out barnyard and earthy characters. The fruit is way behind the tannins and lean structure. Maybe with aging it will develop.
Earthy, scratchy, herbal aromas of cassis and raspberry lead to a punchy, wiry palate. Generic cherry and berry flavors are herbal and lightly green, while this is grabby and tannic on the finish.
Warm, baked and a little cheesy, but if you get past the wine's minor faults and consider its price, it rates well. Along with heat-based aromas, there is rubber and generic dark berry, while the palate is snappy, tight and tastes of raspberry, strawberry and vanilla. A blend of Merlot, Bonarda and Sangiovese.
An uneasy mix of grapes and flavors. Peaches and apricots—more skin than flesh—seem to hit a hard wall and just stop. Can a Viognier have a “dumb” phase? That is what seems to be going on here.
Here's an easy Cabernet. It's dry and medium-bodied, with black currant and cherry flavors and soft tannins. Finishes with the rich taste of cocoa.
This very limited (600 cases) companion to the winery's Ethos Chardonnay marks a turnaround for Ste. Michelle's red wine program, as Bob Bertheau came on board just before the 2003 crush. The style is seductive, sharp and spicy; the tart fruits tumble out in a pile of mixed berry and cherry. Chocolate and baking spices add more flavors; the wine is seamless, smooth and long; the oak beautifully integrated.
This wine is tough and thin in fruit, and very dry. There's a suggestion of cherries, but this is a lot of money to pay for something that isn't a sure thing.
With a strong foundation of oak, this well-made wine broods in grippy tannin and black cherry fruit, imparting muscular highlights of leather and tobacco. As it finds its way to a seamless lengthy finish, accents of chocolate-covered espresso beans play on.
Sabazio is a bold and savory Rosso di Montepulciano with spicy aromas of leather, tobacco, ripe fruit, blackberry preserves and rum cake. The intensity of the bouquet is there but the mouthfeel is light and tight.
This is a real success for the winery, made bracingly fresh and crisp despite its 3% residual sugar. Bright flavors of pink grapefruit dominate the palate, filling out a pristine, crisp and deliciously fresh finish.
Fresh lemon, tangerine and apricot notes abound in this juicy, easy-going Chardonnay. Lack of oak aging highlights its youthful, primary character. Racy lemon acidity and zesty lemon-skin reverberate on the finish.
Ripe yet deftly balanced, this full-bodied wine offers an abundance of blackberry fruitiness balanced by tones of granite and dried herb. It's sumptuous and expansive on the palate, finishing long with fine, sharply edged tannins.
This compelling Monument Tree Pinot offers a sauvage earthiness, layers of red cherry and blueberry fruit and a depth of character packaged deftly around its silky smooth texture. This is a knockout wine, a testament to the power of great farming and winemaking in a cool year.
Slightly funky notes of yeast hover above a citrus freshness. The palate is totally crisp but rounded out by more funky, spicy notes that highlight pepper and yeast on the slender, crisp body. This takes time to come out of its shell and will benefit from some bottle age. Drink from 2017.
This vintage of Syzygy Syrah lacks the complexity of past versions, with fruit that is a bit on the thin side, or perhaps just hidden by alcohol and oak. The wine shows powerful vanilla and tobacco aromas, and they carry through on the palate, masking the fruit.
Fans of this Chilean specialty should be thrilled because this wine is well made and complete. Mint, plum, blackberry, cola and fine leather grace the nose, while the palate sings with forward but balanced black fruit and tobacco flavors. Elevated Carmenère; great for the faithful as well as newcomers.
This is classic, off-dry Vinho Verde. With its light prickle, crisp fruit that has a tangy lime and lemon character that comes through the candy flavor, it is a refreshing, light wine.
Very crisp in zesty acidity, bone dry, and with exotic flavors. This stony, minerally Chardonnay impresses for its firm structure. Flavorwise, it's explosive in lemons, limes, crunchy pears, Asian spices and buttery vanilla, even though it's unoaked. Showcases its terroir in a fine way.
This wine seems thin and rather tight. It has as much acidity as it does fruit, and a dry tannic structure. Not a wine for aging.
Quite a good Pinot, dry and complex. Although it's pale in color and lightly silky in the mouth, it packs a punch, delivering waves of cherry, cranberry, spice and sandalwood flavors. One quibble is that acidity is high, which calls for rich fare to pair it with, such as Ahi tuna, beef and lamb.
Remniscent of almond-and-lemon pastry, this wine is layered with sliced apples and just a touch of bitter toffee. This is a wine that has a fine balance, perfumed with honey and finished with citrus acidity.
Enticing scents of rose, violet, smoke, red berry and white pepper are just some of the aromas you'll find on this stunning wine. The elegantly structured palate delivers juicy wild cherry, crushed raspberry, cake spice and mineral alongside elegant tannins and bright acidity. A licorice note signals the close. Drink 2016–2026.
Caramel, peach custard, caramelized apple, baked Asian pear and cinnamon show on the lavish nose of this bottling. Orange Creamsicle notes mark the palate, where rounded, baked Gala apples meet with a touch of walnut oil. Somehow just enough acidity and depth is integrated into this rich style.
This is one unabashedly bold, brawny wine that's full of rich red fruit and milk chocolate. Bright herbal and floral tones add an unusual freshness to this Croatian Plavac Mali. Intense, penetrating tannins frame the long, mocha-flavored finish.

This has grassy tones and tropical fruit flavors that'll pair with oysters and other shellfish just fine.
Frankly sweet, and zesty in acidity, this is a nice, clean bubbly for those who like a bit of sugar in the finish. It has pleasant flavors of tangerine and vanilla, with a light, delicate mouthfeel.
The very slightest touch of honey plays among the citrus notes on the nose. There is a touch of yellow pear but the streamlined palate is guided by a seam of lemon zest, smoke, pear and citrus keep echoing each other beautifully. Will benefit from two to three years of bottle age.
Barrel fermented. Scents of new wood dominate; the juice is very tart, the oak not yet well-integrated.
A single-vineyard wine from Oregon can be a component rather than a complete wine, but here it is an absolute joy. Fragrant and complex, this offers pleasures for both nose and palate, with scents of leaf and spice and herb, leading into a surprisingly dense and textural blend of wild berry, rhubarb, melon and mixed tropical fruits. Fascinating and long, this is a fine example of Oregon Pinot at its most elegant and fascinating.
With 13 g/l residual sugar, this is a soft, off-dry style of Riesling that boasts admirable purity to its melon and lime flavors. It's medium bodied, with a softly lingering finish that imparts great elegance, a character sometimes missing from Otago wines.
Mocha notes are upfront on the nose, with supporting fruit elements of raspberry and cherry flesh. Medium weight with a touch of bitter fruit-skin flavors in the mouth, and a short but clean finish. Easy and straightforward; drink now.

Peppery and crisp, this is a ripe and fruity wine. A bite of spice and tangy orange zest adds character to the peach and red berry fruits. It's a rich wine that could age, so drink from 2015.
Dimension and a broad feel characterize this Extra Dry Prosecco—the added density is probably due to the small percentages of Perera and Verdiso that are blended in. You'll get aromas of stone fruit, melon, apricot and white flower. The mouthfeel is smooth and slightly sweet.
Earthy and simple, with a taste of canned peach juice.
Produced from old vines, this generous wine is ripe with black fruits, with a juicy, dense texture as well as ripe tannins. The structure is comfortably cushioned within the rich fruitiness, giving way to a crisp, lingering aftertaste. Drink now.

A richly, aromatic wine, with honey and lemon aromas announcing a richly textured wine. Spice, dried apricots and honey mingle with acidity in this gloriously rich wine.
This mature wine is a touch gritty and baked on the nose, and the palate has some scratch and choppiness to the mouthfeel. But core flavors of stewed berry, baked plum and cherry are good, and the finish of molasses, brown sugar and ripe berry fruit has its merits. Drink now.
A burly, rough-hewn wine that has been slightly tamed by the use of French oak aging. But it remains a dense wine, packed with dry tannins, spice and herbs, and some juicy black plum flavors. The finish is dry, very firm, and the wine needs at least five years.
With just a bit of oak adding a note of buttered toast, this bone-dry, high-acid Chardonnay tantalizes with savory citrus fruit enriched with pear and honeysuckle. From Talley, and made from their vineyards in the Edna and Arroyo Grande valleys. Good price for a Chardonnay this elegant.
Focused flavors of mint and black currant come together in this distinctive Cabernet. There's a touch of oak too that adds spice, and the overall character is elegant. The wine will benefit from some aging to further integrate its parts.
This is a great vineyard, that delivers fruit that deserves to be showcased on its own. Precisely defined, tart fruit braced against sharp acids bring out the cranberry wild raspberry flavors; there is a sharp, spicy herbal streak as well, hinting at licorice or anise. Good concentration through a long finish.

Raspberry, medicine cabinet and Red Vine aromas lead to sweet, succulent fruit flavors and a tart finish. Good things are going on but the wine could use more structure to back it all up.
A Rhône-inspired mélange, this mixes Syrah, Counoise, Mourvèdre and Grenache. Nothing dominates or stands out; it's a monolith of red fruit flavor, featuring a streak of dark chocolate and a hint of earth.
Attractive and fruity wine with a twist of tannin over the juicy yet bitter cherry fruit. The wine has a sense of structure, firm and showing some wood as well as tannin. Worth aging another year.
This wine is flat and capped on the nose. On the palate, it's angular and narrow, with cidery flavors and little to no complexity.
Golden delicious apple and pear aromas open this round, somewhat loosely knit wine. Tastes a bit sweet, and decidedly more ripe than anticipated, even a touch mature. Has a good bead and an orange note on the finish.
Crisp, light, almost delicate, this is certainly sophisticated wine. With lively acidity, bright white fruits and a tangy minerality, it does everything this style of Champagne should do. Over the years, as the grapes in Champagne get riper, this cuvée has become drier, while remaining well balanced.
Structured and balanced, this opens with aromas of dark berry, violet, menthol and spice. The focused palate doles out juicy black cherry, ripe strawberry, ground pepper, anise and chopped herb against a backdrop of closely-knit, refined tannins. Drink 2018–2028.
Outside of a couple of Michigan wineries, Adelsheim may be the only domestic producer of this obscure white grape, a cross between Pinot Noir and Gouais Blanc. This aromatic, European-styled wine carries scents of pear and citrus, with crisp fruit flavors buoyed by a bracing minerality.
Combines a delicate body with punchy flavors to create a feminine wine of considerable power and finesse. It avoids jamminess, coming down on the side of less ripe earth and tomato, although there are gorgeous stone fruit notes and a sumptuous overlay of smoky oak. The flavors and texture are absolutely terrific.
Purple, grapey fruit flavors are simple but good, with hints of clay. Tannins are light, offering little structure. Aromas are a bit muddled, red berry one minute then mint and leather the next, with wafts of weediness.
A little too jammy, with pineapple, apricot and vanilla spice flavors. The sweetness is balanced with lemony acidity, but it's not really a dry table wine.
While initially quite closed, time and aeration seem to replace dusty mineral and smoke tones on the nose of this dry rosé with prettier notes of blossom and cherry. It's delicately concentrated but revitalizing and refreshing.

This shows an old-fashioned Spring Mountain dryness and tannic astringency, which makes it hard to enjoy at the moment. Decant it for several hours to let it mellow so you can enjoy the deep core of black currant flavor.
This drinks much drier than its 12.3% alcohol and 1.5% residual sugar would indicate. It tastes of cold steel around the edges, but with some good peach and apple fruit flavor in the core. Somewhat reminiscent of an Australian style, it is a food wine rather than a sipping wine.
The pure scent of freshly picked strawberries is as enticing on the nose as it is on the palate. The gentle flavors are supported by bright lemony freshness and a frothy fizzy mousse that accentuates the purity of these primary flavors perfectly. All of this spells lightness and ease.

Frankly sweet, with sugared fruit juice flavors that turn vapid and cloying.

Intense in black, brooding blueberry and cinnamon spice, this wine is robustly varietal if not a bit overdone, dense and syrupy with challenged acidity.
Light apple aromas lead to a sweet, mildly candied palate of monotone apple flavors. Acidity is up there, so there isn't any overt thickness or chunkiness to the wine. Rudimentary and quaffable.
Bringing out the austerity of the Dão, this is a sinewy wine. It has black currant fruits, packed with juicy acidity. The tannins give a taut, dry core, very mineral and steely.
Intense notes of saffron and pollen lend spice to pretty blossom aromas on this fragrant Pinot Grigio. Flavors of pressed apples on the palate seem savory and subdued by comparison, but lemon-lime acidity brightens the finish.

Nobody says Paso Robles is white wine country, as evidenced by this unbalanced hulk that weighs in at 15.7%. One reviewer refused to rate it, calling it a “strange brew of heat and chemicals,” while our other two panelists found it barely acceptable but loaded down with oak, butterscotch and vanilla.
This is completely dominated by oak. It doesn't have the fruity richness to support the toasted notes and invasive wood sensations. It finishes on an astringent note.

Despite the light color and delicate silky mouthfeel, this mountain Pinot Noir is potent in fruit.

In the heat of the 2008 vintage, it may have been a mistake to further dry 20% of the grapes for this wine. The result has turned out chocolaty-ripe, but also with a touch of raisining evident, and while there's volume, there's also a certain lack of midpalate richness.

Marzipan, marshmallow, cotton candy, churned butter and pie crust show on the very buttery but fascinating nose of this bottling, made by a winery that likes lots of bottle age.

There is plenty of wood here, quite a dominant feature. The fruit comes behind, showing bright ripe white fruits and a hint of apricot. The wood spice, though, has the last word.
Made with a blend of two of Friuli's most traditional grapes, Picolit and Verduzzo Friulano, Siùm shows a rich, copperish color, with intense aromas of almond paste, butterscotch, caramel, candied fruit and orange zest. The Verduzzo elements lends a distinctive characteristic of yellow candy.

Peppery raspberry aromas are sassy and prickly. The palate holds its own but is modest overall, while flavors of medicinal red fruits carry an herbal streak. This is quiet on the finish, almost to the point of muteness.

Alvarinho is best from the far north of Vinho Verde, which is the source for this wine. It gives a full, rich, very ripe wine that's rounded and packed with yellow fruits and a tight mineral and lemon juice character. The wine also has youth on its side and could age for several more years. Drink from 2014.
Aromas of spiced apples, lemon, mustard seed and mineral make for an attractive nose, but the palate is a tad tart, featuring mostly lemon, green apple and citrus rind. In general, it's light, lean and probably better as an aperitif than as an accompaniment to fine food.
If Cabernet Sauvignon isn't careful, Cab Francs like this are going to elbow it aside. This wine has fine dryness and complexity. It's an elegant, velvety wine that's not as heavy as a Cab Sauvignon, but in the same vein. It's oaky and cherryish and frankly delicious.
At first, all you sense is a heavy, operatic costume of chocolaty, smoky, coffee-like oak flavors. Underneath these, a ripe and slightly sweet boysenberry soul keeps the drama going. Like a sturdy stage set, the richly laced tannins support the fruit and oak until the curtain falls.
The freshest fruit is balanced with vanilla and spice flavors. Crisp apples have light, bright acidity, freshened further with lemon and lime fruitiness that leaves an open, full and generous aftertaste. The wine will be better in 2016.
Dry and fiery, with leaf and herb aromas going head to head with light raspberry. The palate has some depth and sweetness to it, and at the core it's showing cherry, plum and spice flavors. True to the blueprint of traditional Rioja but not a lot beyond the basics. Imported by Frontier Wine Imports.

This is plump and round without being heavy, a slightly chunky Pinot featuring modest plum fruit. Savory accents of roasted meat and coffee add interest. At its suggested retail price of $15, it represents excellent value.
A family-owned vineyard on this famous slope in Morgon supplies the grapes to Duboeuf for the wine. It is structured and dense, full of black plum and berry flavors. Acidity cuts through the tannins, resulting in a wine that will age well. Drink from 2019.
The Jaen grape is specific to the Dão region of central Portugal, where it can produce dense wines with enormous color. This 2009, still surprisingly young for the variety, is dark, concentrated and generous, with sweet black plum notes balanced by hints of oak and lively acidity. This wine is worth holding onto. Drink after 2015.
Wow: simply wonderful! This wine will blow you away on all levels. The intensity, the quality of the mouthfeel, the fine focus of the fruit and spice aromas and its long persistency are stratospheric. It's a dark, brooding expression of Nebbiolo with enough of an aromatic motor to carry it forward many years, if not decades of cellar aging. The Rivetto family has produced a masterpiece.
This five-acre property has produced a ripe wine that is more about fruit than structure. Although there are tannins, the bold, black fruits and fresh acidity show best. The aftertaste is fruit with a generous texture. Drink from 2018.

This opens with aromas of resin and a whiff of dried flower that follow through to the lean palate along with hints of citrus and dried stone fruit. But it's cut short by extremely bitter sensations that recall walnut skin.

Drink through 2019.
Fresh on the nose, with red cherry and apple skin aromas. This feels rather sharp and acidic, with flavors of tart cherry pie and red plum.

Focused apple, pear, lime and grass notes are punctuated by some refreshing minerality here. The wine's elegant in the mouth, with some earthy tones. If only the lovely fruit flavors on the finish hung around just a bit longer. Try with fresh goat cheese, sooner rather than later.

Gainey's basic Santa Rita Chardonnay is a fine wine, dry, crisp and minerally, and this is a good price for it. It shows a nice mélange of oak influences with peach, pear and pineapple fruit flavors.
A bright pear and cinnamon nose opens this attractive, medium-weight wine. The palate shows peach and pear flavors, supported by brisk—some might say sharp—acidity, but flabby it isn't. Shows good balance and a nice long spicy finish, where the oak comes on strong.
A good dash of Petit Verdot in the blend has given this fine wine its extra structure. It is still firm and tight at this young stage although the black-currant fruitiness promises much. From vines west of Pauillac, it is impressively solid and dense. Drink from 2022.
Soft, decadent and approachable, this Cabernet Sauvignon is blended with a little Malbec. It offers flavors of blackberry jam, black currant, dark chocolate and cedar that continue on the long, spicy finish. This is lovely to drink now and over the next five years.
It has aromas of exotic fruit and a whiff of wildflowers. The palate delivers juicy pineapple, honeydew melon, apple and white peach. It's nicely balanced and the creamy texture is energized by a light mineral note.
A beautiful Pinot, not only dry and delicious in citrus, melon, pear, honey and spice flavors, but brightened with the prettiest acidity. Finishes with a mouthwatering clean tartness.
Sweaty leather and cinnamon notes dress up sour cherry aromas and flavors. Shows nice complexity, folding in sweet spice and plum notes, but finishes with a tart, hard edge.

Boasting a nice tannic structure, this is drinking great right now, but hold off till 2020 for supreme sipping.
There is a sense of alcohol with this wine. It is so rich, so dense, so ripe. The texture is round, full in the mouth with a touch of pepper. As a contrast, it also shows a surprising amount of freshness, especially in the aftertaste. Drink this ultra-rich wine from 2018.
Juicy red cherries and raspberries, plus a good line of citrus offer freshness and lively, vibrant flavors. The tannin is present, but really only as a support, not to suggest aging. Glass stopper.

Earthy notes of forest floor, tobacco leaf and black cherry open this wine made entirely from Montepulciano.

Not an ager so enjoy soon.

Vivid fruit flavors light up this extroverted Viognier, starting in the aroma and lasting through the long finish. It tastes like apricot, orange, pineapple, vanilla and cream. Good acidity keeps it lively and fresh, balancing the full body.
A delicious, complex Merlot, although all the parts haven't come together and it needs time in the cellar. It's extraordinarily rich in oak-inspired black cherries, red currants, violets, cocoa, spices and sweet sandalwood, and it should develop nuance and bottle bouquet after 2012.
Lightly honeyed in flavor, the wine has touches of wood as well as a lemon crispness. It's attractive, fruity, ready to drink, just retaining a light toastiness.
A good, lusty wine, although it's too young now, offering a big mouthful of tannins, acidity and immature fruit. A blend of 99% Cab and 1% Petit Verdot, it's a hard wine, but the flavors are immaculate, suggesting ripe blackberries and currants that veer into a touch of raisin. Give it 4–5 years in the cellar to come around.
Peg Bay's Maestro is only bottled in the best vintages, the last being 1998, a wine that continues to age beautifully. In 2001, it's predominantly (75%) Merlot, with the remainder mainly Malbec (15%), with smaller proportions of Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon. Combines toasty new oak with cassis and dried spices in a medium-weight wine, then adds an explosive, tobacco-laden finish. Not available in the US.
Solid, fragrant and as you'd expect, but also high-acid and nervy. Otherwise, this is a perfectly good quaffing Rioja; it's sort of sharp but food-friendly, with tangy cherry and raspberry flavors. Not sour but angular on the palate.
Oak, toast, butter, nectarine, vanilla and butterscotch sensations take center stage in this high-octane Chardonnay from Friuli. The palate is dominated by scorching alcohol that throws the wine out of balance.

From Jim Fetzer, a wine from biodynamically grown grapes, and a study in progress. There is some real complexity here, with those telltale cassis and currant flavors associated with Napa, and rich, fine tannins. Has a few rough edges, but clearly a label to watch.
Quite youthful, this is a sprightly and charming wine, evincing aromas of white flowers and peaches. The crisp palate has lemon-lime notes and a chalky edge. Medium, citrusy finish. Drink now or hold a few years for more complexity.
Rustic and semi-sweet, this Zin is very fruity. It has a briary, peppery edge to the cherries and blackberries.
The Arroyo Seco region of Monterey has yet to prove that it can move beyond dryness and acidity to produce Pinot Noirs of real quality. This is rustic, although it has tasty flavors of cherries, cola and spices. Drink now.
Fully ripe, this opens with scents of hibiscus tea, mixed berry, plum and black cherry. The fruit flavors are bold and intense, right on the border of showing some prune character. Streaks of balsamic, tobacco and black olive make it a real potpourri. Drink up now through 2018.
In so-called Penfolds years, when the stars align for the company, smart money is on the Bin series of wines like this Bin 407 Cabernet. It comes close to the luxury Bin 707 Cabernet in terms of quality, but at a much lower price, boasting ample body and velvety tannins. Hints of cedar, mint and mocha accent concentrated cassis and plum flavors. Drink now–2018.
This is a good wine, textbook Carneros in its dryness, crisp acidity, silky texture and cherry, herb and spice flavors. It's not especially rich, but an elegant Pinot Noir for drinking now.
Napa Cabernet specialist Krutz has been looking for a place to buy grapes for Chardonnay. Now they have a Russian River bottling, and it's quite a good one. This shows the region's brisk acidity and minerality, as well as a purity of orange, pineapple, apricot and green apple fruit, elaborated with sweet new oak. Drink now, with upscale fare.
I really liked the winery's 2003 Cab Franc, for its dark, black fruits laced with licorice and streaks of tarry tannin. What's missing here is that defining structure; they've slipped this one into the soft, smooth, generic red category. Sweet fruit, some smoke and a bit more stiffness to the tannins still make this wine a relative standout, but it's lost its edge.
Textural and spicy, this has a subtle mix of herb, salts, stem, leaf and wild berry flavors. It's fascinating and complex, with the sort of mystifying sex appeal that only Pinot Noir seems to be capable of. It spent 18 months in 30% new French oak to good effect.
There's lots of rich varietal character in this fresh wine. It's full-bodied and dry, with black currant and cherry flavors and a hit of oak. Finishes with firm tannins, but best consumed now.
Rather than present an overtly floral and fragrant bouquet, this Sauvignon offers creamy tones of melon, apricot and peach. It's a fresh, easy-drinking expression that would work with grilled tuna in tangy lemon sauce.
This fresh wine has attractive citrus and yellow fruit flavors and an orange tang. It needs more time; drink from 2017. The property includes five acres of white grapes and 65 acres of red. Sylviane Garcin-Cathiard also owns Clos L'Église in Pomerol, Château Barde-Haut in Saint-Émilion and Château Branon in Pessac-Léognan.
This straightforward, inviting Barolo boasts classic Nebbiolo aromas of rose, leather, berry spice and tilled earth. It's not loaded with complexity, but the sour cherry, black pepper and clove flavors are delicious. It closes on a note of subtle oak alongside a drying, tannic finish.
Tough and gritty in youth, this Pinot is showing edgy tannins, tart acidity and unincorporated oak. It's almost like a barrel sample. But it's stuffed with currant, licorice and mocha flavors, and should develop well in the bottle. Try after 2009.
Sweet blackberry aromas veer toward kirsch and crème de cassis, while the palate is perfectly ripe and solid, with medium-deep berry flavors and lots of chalky grab to the fairly tannic finish. For a young, basic Toro wine, this exhibits modest signs of elevation and class.

Here's a vineyard-designate wine that boasts all the special characteristics you look for in quality Amarone.

Aromas of mature berry, cooking spice and a whiff of violet lead the nose on this easygoing wine. The simple palate offers dark cherry and a suggestion of almond alongside loose fleeting tannins. Drink soon.
Big, meaty and dense, with dampness, earth and size. This is your typical deep and chewy wine, but the structure and core qualities are just above average.

A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this has a polished, elegant side, and it offers bold fruit tones that are followed by barbecue sauce and stone accents. It feels zesty and perky on the finish thanks to the boldness of the fruit.
A touch of flint meets yeasty, herbal notes of chervil and white pepper. The palate plays these two off each other and adds a generous dollop of pure, linear lemon zest to brighten and heighten everything. Lasting zestiness makes for an ultraclean, very refreshing finish on a very concentrated, taut body.
Nicely done, a touch soft, but strong as a whole. The nose shows some typical Arienzo earth and stewiness, while the balanced palate is meaty but fresh enough, with good berry fruit resting on a bed of firm tannins and proper acids. Not a complicated wine; it's classic Rioja.
With equal parts earth and fruit, this richly composed kabinett offers plump, cushiony peach and apricot flavors, offset by zesty acidity and dusty, earthy complexities. It's an approchable yet elegantly balanced, nuanced wine.
Hard, lean and minerally, with mouth-tingling acidity and flavors of stone, herbs and citrus fruits. This is not one of your fat, hedonistic monsters, but will pair better with foods. The finish turns honeyed, with hints of peaches.

Citrus aromas are familiar. Lively and zesty in the mouth, with refreshing acidity. Orange and passion fruit lead the palate, which transitions to grapefruit. Crisp on the finish. Good for an everyday white wine.

Alluring aromas including crushed flower, underbrush, espresso and subtle oak carry over to the palate along with raw cherry, roasted coffee bean and dried sage. It's still austere, with astringent tannins that give a drying finish. Drink 2018–2030.

Estate-grown, though it is not indicated on the label, this matches black raspberries to a lightly toasty frame. The wine spent just under a year in French oak prior to bottling. The fruit and oak components are in good proportion, but another year or two in bottle will help to meld the flavors.
This is estate grown, from a Lake Chelan winery in an emerging region. Riesling is clearly a strength, as this has a delicate elegance often missing from the fruit bombs that can be grown in warmer sites. Bone dry, dusty and lightly floral in the nose. The balance of blossom, yellow fruits, juicy acidity and wet rock is impeccable; the wine extends itself gracefully into a lingering finish.

Dark berry and lemony oak lead the aromas on this barrel-driven Malbec. In the mouth, it's resiny and creamy, while blackberry and woody flavors yield to café mocha. A resiny finish is loaded with overt oak character. Drink through 2018.
This is a jammy and fruit-forward selection, with lively notes of raspberry, strawberry and red plum, accented by nuances of potpourri and gamy meat. Medium tannins and skin-driven fruit flavors provide the palate nice structure and grip.

The result of a joint project between Michel Rolland and Jair Agopian, this Bulgarian Bordeaux-style blend has primary aromas of ripe blackberry, dark cherry and black plum that give way to intriguing secondary notes of saddle leather, tobacco leaf and graphite. It exhibits nice weight on the midpalate with juicy flavors of cassis, black raspberry and cherry vanilla. The tannins are firm yet velvety and there is a surprising burst of bright fruit in the finish.
Like Chiarlo's 2000 Cerequio, this wine's aromas are dominated by burnt-match scents. Underlying are some attractive black cherry and tar flavors, nestled in a surprisingly supple, medium-weight mouthfeel.
Forward and savory, with crisp acidity giving a balancing bite to the green apple, pineapple, honey, fig, smoky vanilla and peppery spice flavors. Easy to find, with more than 12,000 cases produced.
Lightly hued and luminous, this offers aromas of dried rose petal, red berry and a whiff of baking spice. The elegant palate delivers wild strawberry, red raspberry, wild cherry, licorice and white pepper alongside silky tannins. It shows a more subtle and delicate side to Barolo. Drink through 2024.
Aromas of tropical fruit, spring flowers and white peach lead the nose on this single-vineyard bottling. The rich palate doles out green apple, ripe pear and candied citrus zest alongside racy acidity and a foaming mousse.
This is one of those earthy Chards, the kind that bring to mind dusty brown spices. It's got appley and smoky, woody flavors, and is dry.
Quite Burgundian in nature, this offering is not opulent, but is very well defined, with an almost etched nature. Lean, with tart cherry, licorice and mineral aromas and flavors, and fairly light in body, it is big on character and traditonal Pinot style. The wine is quite taut now, but the finish is very long and complex. Should be beautiful with three to five years’ aging.
Young, fragrant, and loaded with milk chocolate and spicy berry. Tight, tannic, with grip and tang; pleasingly moderate, listed under 14% alcohol. Although this has no Grenache in it, it has that sort of tart berry quality, with stiffer tannins.
What a delicious, mouth-watering wine to serve with appetizers. It's crisp in acidity and rich in orange, apricot and peach flavors that finish a little sweet.
Oaky with candied pineapple, orange and buttered toast flavors. The acidity is bright and delicate.
With apricot and citrus flavors, this Riesling tastes off-dry, with a honeyed sweetness. It's a little green around the edges, which detracts from the pleasure.
As intense and strapping as a Hall of Fame cornerback, this Cabernet is ripe in dark cherry, vanilla and milk chocolate, the tannins mouthfillingly sweet. Built to last, it should stand up to even the fiercest of meats, from rib eye to ribs.
Delicate aromas suggest white spring flower and pear. On the linear palate, vibrant acidity balances tart apple and lemon-zest flavors. A light mineral note energizes the finish.
Good, thick, black cherry fruit, dense tannins, with a dark, dense, chalky finish. This is manly Zin—muscular, balanced and heavy. Great for outdoor grilling.
Sirmian is a beautiful Pinot Bianco that really shows true varietal characteristics. The subdued bouquet delivers pear, stone fruit and crushed mineral. The mouthfeel is creamy, rich and ends with waxy flavors of lemon and Golden Delicious apple.
This is a great, generous wine, packed with dark fruit and tannins. It comes from a well-drained vineyard on the slopes of the hill of Hermitage. There's dry tannins, but they are overwhelmed by the huge spice, herbal,    and blackberry jelly flavors. It should age well over 10-20 years.
A worthy followup to the dramatic '08. Bone dry and zesty in cool-climate acidity, it shows bracing flavors of steely minerals, Meyer lemons, limes and buttered toast. A terrifically complex, Chablis-style wine made for upscale fare, and should develop bottle complexity over the next six years.
A finely balanced wine, preserving the mineral edge and keeping fine acidity while displaying  ripe white and yellow fruits.
Dusty Mexican chocolate meets black plum, cherry and pomegranate in this light-bodied, rounded wine that's juicy and delicious. It's well balanced and approachable now, so drink up.
This is a smooth, orange- and peach-flavored wine, with a rich almost oily texture. It's rounded with light acidity on the finish. With its weight, this is a wine for food.
Floral and citrusy on the nose, then picking up white peach, melon and pineapple flavors on the palate. Off-dry, but crisp and clean on the finish, where there's also a slight bitter-pith note.
This is a full-bodied and intensely fruity wine with jammy aromas and ripe cherry and raspberry flavors. It is smooth textured and has soft tannins, so the effect is easygoing in spite of high alcohol.
This is full and solid, with blackberry, boysenberry and toasty aromas. It feels smooth and lush, with plump blackberry fruit and a flavor of roasted, smoky oak. The finish is mellow, with medium intensity. Drink now and over the next two years.
Raisin, dust and red-apple aromas come across soft and jammy. The palate follows that lead: it's flat and grabby, with density and mild acidity. Raisin and rubbery flavors turn slightly bitter on the finish, which shows rubbery tannins.
The 2004 vintage wasn't all that kind to many Pinot Noir producers at the northern end of NZ's South Island. Neudorf's 2004 Nelson bottling shows some herbal, beet-like notes on the nose, and the tannins and acids both have a slightly green edge to them. Still, there's ample cherry fruit and some mushroomy complexity to round it out.
The best things about this boxed Merlot are its dryness and balance. Shows a real understanding of the way acids, tannins, fruit and oak should interplay. The blackberry and currant flavors are not enormously concentrated, but this is quite an attractive wine, and a great value at this price.
This is a soft, simple Merlot, with slender flavors of blackberries, cocoa and spices.
Rich and broad in the mouth, with notes of honeyed citrus reminiscent of tangerine and a tang of peppery spice. The finish is warm, spicy and long, with a hint of vanilla oak. Drink it now and over the next year or two for its undeniable richness.
Heavy, soft and sweet, this tastes like the syrup used to make cherry cola before being carbonated.
A good, rustic wine with blackberry flavors and firm tannins. It's nicely dry, and has firm acidity. A very nice Cab for everyday drinking.
Although this comes from a vineyard outside the Meursault appellation, the vines are tended with the same care as any Meursault vineyard. The wine is rich, with flavors of almonds and lemon. Rounded out with a light application of wood.
Chunky, wayward aromas are vague at best. This has no structural integrity, while waxy green-apple flavors come with bitterness and a flabby, oily finish. Barely passable.
Earth and bacon aromas meld into darker and fuller berry notes, while the medium-bodied palate shows solid but generic strawberry and raspberry flavors. There's nothing unusual or wrong with this wine; it's ripe, moderately textured and even shows some light milk chocolate throughout.
This boisterous Pinot Noir offers heavy cedar, raspberry liqueur, cola syrup and Kahlua aromas. Bright red fruit flavors of strawberry pie are rich and mouth-coating like a fine brandy, but remain soft and tasty throughout. This is a no-holds-barred wine.
sweet-tart candy, vanilla, and pineapple scent this Traminer and Chardonnay blend. It's zesty in the mouth, tasting of grapefruit and lemon zest.
Verging on orange in color, this intensely botrytized wine from one of Germany's unique grape varieties is thick, almost chewy with extract and sugar. Dried apricot aromas lead into orange marmalade flavors with an almost burnt, caramelized quality. Finishes long, with a hint of bitterness that helps balance some of the intense sweetness.
Ripe, fruity Chardonnay, with toast flavors balancing with smooth apricot and pear juice. The wine is soft, rich and generous, finishing with a light acidity.
A blend of 13 different grape varieties, some rare, this is a delicious, honeyed wine, with rich baked apple flavor and crisp acidity, topped with a creamed spice note. Its pure line of citrus provides a lively finish.
A blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Meunier, this wine has great fruit and a soft texture. The flavors of ripe bitter orange and apples are now moving towards maturity, with the toastiness coming through. Drink now.
Yummy Chard, complex and delicious. Offers lots of ripe, rich peach and pineapple custard flavors, sweet, toasty oak and a buttery texture. Nice, perky acids keep things lively and clean.
As with many Beaujolais Nouveau in 2009, the color here is dark, a bubbly purple. The fruit though is somewhat lean, the acidity too prominent. The wine has a deal of banana and redcurrant fruits.
Forest floor, new leather, pressed violet, ripe berry, Mediterranean herb and eucalyptus aromas lead the way on this robust red. The densely concentrated palate shows raisin, vanilla, prune and espresso alongside the warmth of evident alcohol. Chewy tannins provide support while a hint of licorice wraps up the finish. Give it a few years to unwind, then drink to capture the remaining fruit richness.
Coming from one of the state's premier Syrah vineyards, this wine starts out aromatically reserved before blossoming to reveal notes of dark raspberry, dried cranberry, woodspice, vanilla and anise. It shows the warmth of the vintage with concentrated, black-fruit flavors backed by a light squeeze of tannins followed by a lengthy finish. The oak plays prominently but it works.
I can't recall a misstep from this reliable producer of Tasmanian sparkling. The latest vintage release is remarkably fresh and zesty, bursting with green apple and citrus, with just hints of toasted brioche. This light- to medium-bodied wine is a blend of 53% Chardonnay and 47% Pinot Noir.
Marred by a green peppercorn unripeness that makes the tannins especially difficult and dry. Hard to fall in love with, despite some good black cherry, plum and cola flavors. The chilly vintage seems to have worked against this wine.
Sour cherry, cranberry, iron, dust and a touch of game appear on the nose of this always-reliable appellation blend from the late actor's family winery, which is still run by his descendants. The flavors are mellow in presentation, with cranberry, fennel and a touch of Early Grey tea.
Made with air-dried Tocai Friulano grapes (now simply called Friulano), this golden wine opens with apricot tones, peach, candied fruit and honey. It's a simple, clean sweet wine with a crisp touch of acidity on the finish.
A ripe wine that is polished almost as bright as a diamond. Big, chocolaty flavors are balanced by some acidity and soft tannins. This is a seductive wine that belies the quality of the vintage, showing concentration and sweet, dense fruit.
Crisp and acidic, with distinct scents and flavors of juicy pear and melon. The sharp acidity and pear skin phenolics place it squarely in the Pinot Grigio (hence Italian) camp.
Tropical mango, melon, citrus and peach-pit aromas are typical for Verdejo. Flavors of citrus peel and stone-fruit pits follow the nose, while this organic-grape offering is mildly green on a light fresh finish.
Intense mineral tones of smoke and crushed slate collide with fresh red cherry and raspberry flavors on the palate of this bang-for-your-buck rosé. Its concentrated fruit flavors are luscious and satisfying but also vibrantly structured, proving dexterous beyond the apéritif hour.
Currant, cranberry, perfume and a sense of freshness make up this simple quaffer. Medium in body, with a hint of tannins, this tastes mostly of stone fruits. Papaya and apricot flavors round out the finish.
This Napa Valley boutique winery now ventures into Oregon, with a tart, juicy and aromatic Pinot Noir from the Roserock vineyard. Despite all the criticism about the thin wines from the 2011 vintage, there have been some wonderful examples, with finesse and detail. Crisp raspberry fruit anchors this rather delicate, expressive and delicious wine, aged 18 months in French and American oak, 45% new.
A Franc that shows off its herbal character in a big way, with aromas of fresh tarragon and basil. Fresh berry flavors provide a juicy counterpoint to the green herbs. A lighter style than many L.I. Cabernet Francs, but a successful one.
Jaboulet's basic Crozes is a good value in '07, offering complex aromas of smoke, plum, black olive, horse sweat and cracked pepper framed by slightly coarse tannins. Turns firm on the finish, yet remains mouthwatering. Drink now–2017.
Fresh, fruity and crisp, this is an attractive, refreshing wood aged wine. It has citrus and crisp apple and riper apricot flavors, bright with acidity and needing a few more months to age. Drink from late 2016.
Underbrush, scorched earth, ripe berry, blue flower and leather aromas take shape in the glass. The full-bodied enveloping palate doles out black cherry marinated in spirits, fleshy raspberry, truffle game and dark baking spice alongside firm, velvety tannins. A licorice note marks the finish. It's evolving quickly and won't need years to come around. Drink 2020–2030.
This is a ripe, wood-aged wine made from Arinto, the local grape of Bucelas. Rich and full, it has a touch of lemon that combines well with its tropical fruit flavors. It has fine concentration and is ready to drink.
There are soapy, grassy elements to the bouquet of this easy Grigio that help shape its perky, cheerful personality. The mouthfeel is clean and simple but the wine does a great job of keeping your palate clean.
Tough, herbal and hard in the mouth, this tannic wine offers modest blackberry flavors and a dose of oak. It turns syrupy-sweet on the finish.
A greeting of caramel and honey reveals a touch of barrel reduction in this medium-bodied, generously layered wine. It imparts a ripeness of melon and apple, finishing in a sprinkling of nutmeg.
Concentrated and structured, this layers wood and vanilla flavors with a taut, mineral character. With its richness and well-balanced citrus, tropical fruit flaavors, it will certainly age for at least four years. Screwcap.
You notice this wine's unctuousness from the glycerine that stains the glass. The aromas are closed, suggesting dark stone fruits. In the mouth, tannins mask a core of berry fruit. Acidity is low and makes the wine seem a little flabby. A blend of Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon, Petite Sirah, Merlot and Mourvèdre.
Yeasty and lemony, this has the snap and tang of citrus—notably grapefruit. This dry and bracing bubbly shows a touch of minerality as well. A nice choice to accompany fresh oysters.
This is fragrant and lighthearted, with citrusy acidity that laces through the easy, bright green-apple texture. It's crisp, with a floral finish.
With firm tannins, rich berry fruits and more typical red cherry flavors, this has weight and a ripe juicy core. It's ready to drink, but could be kept for another year.
This producer fought against Mother Nature and the wet 2002 vintage with 36 months of barrique aging. The wood tones almost overwhelm the fruit and leave only glimmering remnants of vibrant cherry and raspberry liquor. The wine also tastes very sweet and end with good freshness.
You'll love the powerful richness and natural concentration of this beautiful Barolo. It boasts masculine renderings of cherry liqueur, carob pod, red rose and sassy cinnamon spice. The wine shows great aging potential (10 years or more) thanks to its firm tannins and fresh acidity.
Vibrant and savory, this blend of 70% Sangiovese, 15% Sagrantino and 15% Merlot delivers succulent black cherry, crushed plum, black pepper, grilled herb and mocha flavors alongside firm but velvety tannins. It's well balanced with surprisingly fresh acidity for the hot vintage. It's already drinking well but will be even better after 2016.
Granducato is a brand made by the Consorzio Agrario di Siena and this wine opens with ripe aromas of blackberry preserves and raspberry jelly. There's a touch of cured meat as well, and the wine shows a tight, streamlined feel in the mouth.
The new release from this old (1972) vineyard boosts the alcohol to 13.9%, dropping the residual sugar to just over 1%. Deep, concentrated, and driven by a dense minerality, this exceptional single-vineyard Riesling has raw fruit flavors of green apple, white peach and citrus rind. Sure to evolve, perhaps over decades, it has the vivid acidity and penetrating finish to improve significantly.
Classic notes of lychee and rose petal waft on the nose of this delicate Gewürztraminer. Off dry in style, it's brisk and dancing, offsetting plush, juicy white grapefruit with spice and honey. Finishes briskly on a sugary pastry note.
Gets off the mark a bit chunky and soft, with heavier than usual peach and melon aromas. Melon, papaya and green banana carry the plump, full-bodied palate to a soft, easy, almost shy finish. Weighty for Verdejo.
Rubbery aromas of asphalt vie with berry fruits and hints of green herbs, particularly mint. The palate is big, soupy and round in feel, with herbal flavors of baked plum and raspberry. On the finish, things turn salty and herbal, with roasted overtones.
This blend of Semillon and Sauvignon Blanc tends on the sweet side, but it offers appealing flavors of vanilla and tropical fruit. An enjoyable, approachable wine.
A clumsy wine that aims for white Bordeaux in style and falls far short. There's plenty of oak and lees, but the underlying wine is thin and disappointing in citrus flavor.
With ripe berry fruits, this smooth wine has a layer of balanced tannins. It is structured, jammy in character, full of black currant flavors and final acidity. Drink from 2016. The château's history goes back to the 14th century and became a ruin after the 1789 Revolution. It was completely restored after World War II.
The maturity of this wine gives it velvetine richness, spice and leather texture. The fruit on this smooth, ripe wine is mellow and offers acidity and red cherries. It's a delight to drink now.
This dark, heavy Pinot Noir is surprisingly soft for a Sonoma Coast bottling, despite its rich layers of black cherry pie, licorice, cola and smoky sandalwood. Drink it now.
Black olive tapenade, savory bay leaf and a tight but energetic body currently characterize this wine. Deep blueberry fruit tantalizes from behind wonderfully firm tannins in this medium-bodied, peppery number.
From selected grapes, this concentrated wine is dense and still needs aging. It has layers of wood over dark, brooding black fruits and a powerful structure of smoky toast and tannins. Big, rich and with great potential, it should be drunk from 2016.
A fleshy, full-bodied Syrah with a streak of gingerbread flavor that's got a bite of heat on the finish. This is a wine for people who like a bolder, higher-alcohol style.
Pure blueberry fruit is given extra lift by sprays of white pepper. There is a wonderful balance between the crunchy freshness of just-ripe fruit with all its grip and bite and the generosity and purity of well-farmed fruit. There might be some rusticity around the edges but there also is innate elegance.
This mountain Cab is dependably hard in youthful tannins on release. That won't stop most people from drinking it too young, but with its rich, deep cassis flavors, it would be a shame to pop the cork before 2010.
Here is a tight and polished Barolo with a touch of ripe fruit surrounded by leather, black pepper, cola, pressed violets and tar. The wine reflects the characteristics of both the Langhe and the Nebbiolo grape variety: it's elegant, structured and needs some cellar aging.
From the esteemed grower behind many a famous Sonoma Coast Chardonnay, this estate wine is golden colored and intoxicatingly inviting in layers of baked apple, lemon verbena and orange blossom. A toasty subnote gives the impression of voluptuousness in this otherwise lean and lovely wine.
This cuvée is made with the oldest block in this biodynamic vineyard. Planted in 1998, all Pommard clone, and given some extra bottle age, it's drinking well at the moment. Spicy cranberry-raspberry soda flavors come with a textural midpalate. There is a significant scent and flavor of tanned leather, which pleases some tasters more than others. That aside, the wine is complex, balanced and reasonably long.
The Red Pony brand is putting out reliably distinct wines. This one smells of cranberry, oregano and barnyard. The tannins and acidity are solid, with strawberry and pomegranate flavors leading to an earthy finish. Hold until 2016 for an even smoother time.
The Mother Vine Cabernet is drinking soft and easy now, with gentle tannins framing slightly herbaceous blackberry and black cherry flavors, touched with smoky oak. It feels like a wine you want to age, although the softness suggests it won't for long.
This directly appealing wine brings notes of the underside of a pineapple, chamomile, talc, wet stone and apricot, mixing delicacy and nuance. It's creamy in feel with rich, concentrated fruit flavors and a long, detailed finish.
This substantial wine is replete with apricot and a faint lurking of herb. The acidity is there, just faintly, racing through to the finish.
This Bulgarian Chardonnay has aromas of lemon curd, custard apple, mango and lemon blossom. It is soft and round in the mouth with pleasant acidity and has flavors of guava, green apple, mango and white peach.
Made from 100% Cab, the grapes once again show what the vineyard, in the hills east of the Silverado Trail, can do. The French oak was 90% new, which would swamp a lesser wine, but not this one. It's rich, full and concentrated, with excellent structure and balance. Drink now, after careful decanting, and through 2020.
This easy-drinking Pinot Noir offers layers of softened cola, pomegranates, red licorice and pepper, wrapped into supple tannins. It's ready to drink now with everything from tuna tartare to roasted salmon and grilled burgers.
Subtle fruit flavors mingle mountain berries, plums and cherries with enticing baking spices. There's a touch of herb, earth and tanned leather also, bringing complexity and texture into a lingering finish. Drink now through 2020.
It's midnight black, thoroughly dry, high in alcohol, and distinctive for the power and authority of its fruity structure. Anyone can achieve ripeness, but this wine's dry balance really makes it special. The tannins ensure a long life. Drink now through 2015.
A direct-pressed wine, this has a pretty copper-pink color. It is intense in cranberry and subtle herbes de Provence, with notions of fresh-cut grass and tart Meyer lemon. Young, it needs time in the glass to reveal its complexity and range of flavor. The finish is dry and succulent on the palate.
An intriguing nose of tobacco, mint, cherry and spice leads this earthy red. Flavors of spice, tobacco, red berry and tea are supported by ageable tannins and good complexity.
A soft, strawberry flavored wine that is smooth and immediately attractive. Despite its low alcohol, it has a ripe feel to it from the rich fruit and the almost off-dry character. The acidity gently kicks in at the end.
The limited-release reserve wine from a 21st century winery and one of the best vineyards in the Graves was wood aged for 24 months. That has given it extra richness and spice along with the dense blackberry fruits. It is complex, ripe with great ageability. Drink this wine from 2019.
Tastes overly soft, too sweet and hot, with berry, chocolate-covered raisin and Port flavors. Not for everyone.
Surprisingly smoky and toasty upfront, but balanced by ample apricot fruit and hints of honey, pineapple and citrus zest. Despite its ripe, oaky nature, there's plenty of crisp acidity to provide structure and prolong the finish. Drink now–2016.
Full-bodied and intense for a rosé wine, the Lekkerwijn offers complexity in a dry, concentrated delivery. Savory and spicy with an herbal spin, the wine finishes long. Pair with spicy food, duck, game fish.
This particular bottling belongs with the very best Syrahs from this Syrah-infatuated state. A broad, toasty, full-bodied and fully realized wine, it has begun to smooth out from the extra years in bottle, but has a long life ahead. Berries, cherries, chocolate, coffee, mocha, tobacco, fungus, graphite… the flavors go and go.
Juicy cassis fills the palate in this balanced wine, blended with small percentages of Malbec, Merlot and Petit Verdot. With a leathery texture and earthy underbody, it's mellow with supple finish.
Thick, concentrated and syrupy, this is a burly, rustic and ripe wine, 100% varietal and aged partially in new French oak. It has a nutty aroma and a touch of smoke.
Touches of rum cake and licorice lend this 60-40 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot an impression of intensity and persistence. The wine delivers flavors of blackberry and candied cherry.
This is a concentrated wine that's full of apricot and apple flavors. It has a steely, tight core as well as rich fruit. It's full and still needs time to develop.
This 100% varietal wine offers generous aromatic notes of guava and pink grapefruit. Flavors are lighter in style with the concentration a bit wanting but it finishes well.
Starts with intense black-fruit aromas and dark, smoky accents as well as baked berries, licorice and meat. In the mouth, it's a bit clumsy and amped up, with big tannins, extract and a mouthfeel that grabs. Flavors of berry fruit and mint are good, while the finish bounces toward a loud finish. Not what you'd call an elegant wine; it's more about ripeness, power and extract.
A powerful, classic Chambertin, intensely structured and tannic. The sweet black fruit is potentially enormous, still finding its place among the tannins. Spice, with a mineral streak, gives the wine added complexity. Very dense in texture, this will age 10 years and many more.
Fermented in new oak, this wine has a nice perfume of citrus, orange marmalade and vanilla. The vanilla comes on stronger in the mouth, followed by tropical white fruit, citrus and a hint of musk. Soft acids and a smooth oak feel finish with a citrusy burst.
Opens with young, punchy aromas of candied raspberry and strawberry. The body is easygoing but the flavors and overall character are more complex than you might expect because Sastre only made this wine and a crianza in '08 while eschewing its high-end wines. With this youngster expect moderate size and intensity, and a full, semilong finish.
Baked red fruit, cherry pie filling and sweet spice dominate the overall character of this wine, with a finish reminiscent of a Christmas fruit cake. Medium weight with vibrant acidity and a clean finish; easy drinking and ready now.
This starts off tarry and tight, but gradually opens up to reveal mint-tinged blueberries. It's medium to full in body and reasonably firm on the palate, but the tannins are silky enough to make it approachable now, imparting a softly dusty touch to the warm, spicy finish.
Bold and minty, with no shortage of tarry, rubbery black-fruit aromas. The palate is full, meaty, tough and tannic, with heat and candied, confected flavors that suggest chocolate-covered cherry and kirsch. Finishes sweet and candied, with average structure and stuffing.
This gorgeous Carignano-based wine from the sun-drenched island of Sardinia shows amazing harmony and personality. There are rich and ripe notes here of blackberry, mature cherry, tobacco, leather and a touch of exotic spice. It's rich, smooth and velvety on the close. Very nice.
Allspice and black raspberries lead off the nose, followed by flavors of juicy plum and thyme on the palate. Accents of milk chocolate and earth add complexity to the otherwise straightforward selection. Nicely balanced with a strong, sweet-spice, lingering finish.
No Time is the name but unfortunately there's no substance and no richness. As a whole, this Garnacha smells of bramble and pickle, while the palate is fresh and bouncy but sour.
There are lots of dried tones to the nose: herbs, meat and hay. The palate shows more fruit, with tart cherry and raspberry flavors giving a snappy resistance to the grippy, sandy tannins.
This is a firm wine, full of tannins as well as plenty of ripe berries. It is concentrated, juicy and perfumed, an attractive wine already. The dry core gives structure to this panoply of fruitiness. The name comes from French king Louis XI who acquired the vineyard in the 15th century.
Big, rowdy flavors like rhubarb and black cherries seem to fill this medium-bodied wine to the rim. Made from an unusual clone smuggled into the U.S. and whole cluster fermentation, it has richness, moderate tannins, and a broad mouthfeel, with little oak flavor showing through.
A density of grapey plum surrounds dusty, chalky tannins that soften on the palate to further reveal red cherry, anise and soy. The wine possesses a distinct herbaceous character throughout.
Very fruity and rich, yet dry and tannic, an interesting blend that combines black cherries and currants with leather, tar and cedar. Shows lots of polish. Now–2012.
Here's an evolved and sophisticated Barolo Riserva with savory aromas of crushed black pepper, balsam, humus, old spice, licorice and root beer. The wine is drying and streamlined in the mouth, and the long finish is accented by lively fruit flavors.
A flavorful, full-bodied white with the body of a leesy Chardonnay, but different flavors. Citrus fruits, almond skin, apricots and an almost Musqué-type floweriness lead to a long, citrusy, crisp finish.
This 100% varietal wine sees a hearty dose of new oak and is built for the long term. It leans classic in its elegant layers of dried herb, red currant and pomegranate flavor. Boldly structured, it pleases rather than challenges the palate.
Late-picked, 100% Cabernet fruit from an iconic Red Mountain vineyard; hence the name, which translates as “the beast”. It's jammy and ripe, but the tannins have been tamed, and the fruit is front and center, along with brown spices and toasty barrel notes. This is a thoroughly delicious wine that seems to be drinking in its prime, though it shows no sign of tiring.
Sometimes translated as “St. George” for the U.S. market, the Agiorgitiko grape can be very grapy when young, as this wine shows. Fine tannins and a mineral streak offer attractive elements, but sweaty notes mar the otherwise fine mixed berry and cola flavors.
A strong contender for the best $22 Merlot in the country. Sculpted, dense and deeply layered, it's loaded with mixed blue and black fruits, fresh herb and sweet toast. The use of new oak is restrained and appropriate, extending the finish with nicely applied streaks of coffee around ripe, tight, dry tannins.
Very fruity, with bright melon, pineapple and red apple flavors. It's a step up from the well-made 2003, with crisp fruit and a bit more complexity. A second taste reveals a tart, racy, fruit-forward food wine with fine balance; a great choice for seafood or chicken salad.
While still young and fruity, this has the potential to be a complex, long-lived wine. It boasts stone fruit and white flower aromas, a tight structure and a hint of sweetness. Drink from 2018.
Off a bit from the '05, but still a good wine, this Sauvignon Blanc shows fresh minty lemongrass, melon, green grass and fennel flavors, backed up with firm acids and, as always, very dry.
Oak sticks out, dominating with smoky caramel and vanilla toast aromas, and things are pretty much the same in the mouth. Under all that wood is a modest wine with thin blackberry fruit flavors.
With delicious texture and concentration, this Lake County blend of Grenache, Syrah and Mourvedre from the 3,000-foot-high Fore Family Vineyard is intensely good, a deep reddish-purple blueberry-tinged infusion of earth and clove spice with dry, tight tannins and even a little lavender that'll linger. This one'll age, but is so convincingly reminiscent of the Northern Rhône right now, it'll be hard to wait.
Slightly green and a touch mulchy. The palate offers a decent mix of red fruits, herbal flavors and leathery notes. Finishes salty and choppy, but overall it's not a bad wine for the price.
This inky, red-violet colored wine offers aromas of black plum and lavender. Flavors of black cherry, raspberry, vanilla, espresso and violet sit among silky tannins that offer a pleasing textural experience to the entire palate. The finish is notable for a short burst of orange zest.
This Pinot shows the early promise of the exciting 2012 vintage. While it's just a basic appellation wine, it's rich in raspberries, cherries, blueberries and persimmons, with the fruit nicely balanced by crisp acidity. Enjoy this ripe wine now through 2016.
Red-cheeked apples, juicy pear and Mirabelle plums comes out to play here, tightly held by brilliant acidity. The undertone of herbal savoriness is glimpsed and will come to the fore as this ages. Drink as of 2016.
This Romanian Cabernet Sauvignon smells like black raspberry, cherry vanilla and a touch of mint. There are flavors of red berries and red plum on the palate.
Kind of soft and collapsed, but dry, with earthy cherry and blackberry flavors, this Cab hails from the cooler west side of the valley. It has a good edge of tannins.
Peppery and trending toward stemmy flavors, this has a phenolic bite. The brambly berry fruit runs quickly into a slightly warm finish.
Nicely ripe fruit flavors and a full rounded texture give this affordably priced wine more presence than most. The aroma is honeydew melon and the flavors are ripe apple and Anjou pear, while the acidity is on the soft side.
Delicate and refined fragrances convey passion fruit, white flower and an herbal note. The palate offers creamy white peach, green melon, nectarine and a light mineral vein alongside bright acidity. This wine is well balanced and loaded with finesse.
A rich, amply endowed Clare Riesling, with potent lime aromas accented by touches of petrol, plenty of flavor intensity and a long finish composed of citrus and spice. Hints of baked apple and petrol suggest it may not be the longest-lived Riesling, but it's delicious now and should be good for another five years or so.
93–95 Huge, concentrated, one of the biggest Pomerols of the vintage, this wine is working its way toward balance between big tannins and fresh acidity.
A massive wine, rich and forward in black cherry and raspberry jam, red currant, bacon and sandalwood flavors. Structural integrity fortunately provides balance by way of crisp acidity, firm tannins and a rocky minerality. Enjoyable now, after decanting, and should age through 2019.
The nose is very quiet but the body emanates a generosity despite its lightness. There is red-cherry fruit and a certain ampleness on a slender, fresh body. Tannins are like barely-there linens. The finish is wonderfully clean.
The aromas on this Rocks District wine pop with huckleberry, black and green olive, plum and mineral. It's dazzlingly polished and textured in feel, with nuanced, detailed smoked meat and savory flavors. It nonetheless retains an exquisite sense of balance and restraint, capped off by an outrageously long finish.
There is something pleasantly bitter on the nose: Burnt sugar or bitter almond. The palate answers this with fluid, rippling sweetness expressed in ripe, juicy, refreshing pear fruit. The bitter notes remain and create an appetizing, tangy edge to this concentrated wine that is streamlined by balancing freshness despite the residual sugar. A lovely balancing act with a bracingly clean, medium dry finish and echoes of citrus zest. Drink 2017–2035.
Not many rosé Champagnes have this vivid pink color. The taste is somewhat less exotic, with a good crisp feel to it, well textured with integrated acidity and red currant fruit. The aftertaste is soft, fresh.
Deep salmon in color, this wine offers a bouquet of cantaloupe and nectarine. It is bright on entry, with full mouthfeel and flavors of pineapple, grapefruit and white peach that culminate in a bright citrus finish.
Mostly Cabernet Sauvignon with four other Bordeaux varieties in the mix, this wine brings an aromatic medley of cherry cola, dark chocolate, and light medicinal notes. The flavors don't entirely meld with the oak showing a bit too prominently, offset by grainy tannins.
An interesting, exotic wine, complex and layered. Butter,cream and caramel underlie apricot aromas while the intense palate shows peach, poached pear and lemon notes. One wishes the butter and toasted bread flavors on the finish would linger just a bit longer.
Winemaker: Charles Hopkins. There are some meaty, gamy hints in the nose of this wine, partnered with tones of green peppercorn, red currant and cherry. It's tart and salty on the palate, with bright, almost spritzy acidity, though gripping tannins soon takeover and carry through the close.
Starts with mild citrus aromas. Zesty in the mouth, with pineapple, grapefruit and apple flavors. Short and compact, with nothing out of the ordinary. Drinkable and fresh. Imported by American Wine Distributors.
Strong in oak and ripe fruit, this tastes overworked. It's dominated by buttered toast, butterscotch and pineapple jam flavors. It will satisfy legions of Chardonnay lovers who like this popular style.
Might this be the best wine Marqués de Cáceres has produced? The vintage is one of Spain's greatest, and gran reserva is supposed to be Rioja in its loftiest form. So indulge in this beauty's rock-solid structure, lovely violet and raspberry aromas, and long, stout finish. Best from 2012–2018.
Here's a winery founded at the start of the 1900s that has morphed over the decades to enthusiastically embrace modern use of oak. In fact, the wood here is almost too much of a good thing with carpentry and cedar notes that mask much of the cherry fruit. In the mouth, it has a chewy texture, smoke favors and a spice-driven finish.
Soft and lightly oaky, this barrel-fermented wine has a lightly honeyed element, perhaps an indication of botrytis. The wine should be consumed young, as it is already showing signs of age in both color and mouthfeel.
This wine pumps up the jammy fruit flavors of the grape variety. It packs in the typical thick but fine tannins, and also contributes spicy complexities like cardamom and black pepper that lend it an extra dimension. The oak flavors seem very intense but there is so much grapy richness that the wine remains powerfully balanced. Drink now through 2020.
This wine is toasty and spicy with black-currant fruits that are still developing. It is fresh although its firm structure needs time to soften. As it matures, it will develop a balance between fruit and tannins. Drink from 2018.
Intense and frisky, with mild green-herbal aromas standing out on the nose. Like any varietal Graciano, the wine is shrill, with acidity pushing the tart side of the huckleberry and blueberry fruit. Lean at the end, with little richness. Best for die-hard Rioja buffs and fans of acidic red wines.
Colomé regularly makes one of Argentina's best Torrontés. This vintage is fresh on the nose, with tropical leanings and lychee aromas. The palate offers pointed acidity and lively flavors of passion fruit, lychee and citrus. This finishes crisp and juicy, but not sizzling or sharp.
Concentrated, ripe, Merlot-typical fruit flavors are the hallmark of this perfumed, ripe wine. It has a solid, slightly extracted character, which brings out an edge of bitterness. In contrast, a sweet-tasting plum note provides an open and round finish. For medium-term aging over 4–5 years.
Citrus and orange blossom waft from the glass followed by plump minerality, Meyer lemon and crème brûlée, wrapped in restrained oak. Fruit sources range from Carneros to Mount Veeder and Oak Knoll, providing a well-balanced range of flavor and tension.
Full-bodied, tannic, juicy-fruity and dry, this red blend has flavors of blackberries, plums, dark chocolate and anise, with spicy, earthy notes of tobacco. Made from Primitivo, Zinfandel and Teroldego.
Vintner Gianmario Marchisio has crafted a complex and generous Roero Riserva with mature fruit tones that soften the blow of Nebbiolo's natural astringency. This is a streamlined, dry wine with a touch of menthol freshness on the close.
For 40 bucks, this is a sumptuous, lush young wine that offers all the fancy fruit and oak you expect from an upscale Napa Cab.
Much like the winery's Pinot Gris, this estate-grown Pinot Blanc is built around mineral-infused fruit that is immaculately clean and vividly refreshing. Tart and juicy, with Asian pear, green apple, and lemon/lime acidity.
A haze of hazelnut and wood smoke envelopes the poised concentrated lemon and green-pear fruit on the palate. There is incisive freshness and a concentrated core with a downright lip-smacking finish. It would be a waste to drink this now when everything about this bundled, energetic wine still needs to unfurl. Give this time. Drink 2020–2030.
Strongly vegetal, with notes of ramps and other odiferous veggies. Disappointing.
Warm, baked and a bit vegetal, with soft plum and berry flavors. Herbal throughout, with decent feel but dry, simple flavors. If you don't mind a touch of tomato, this wine will strike a chord. Otherwise, it may not work for you.
Io has a really good track record with this Syrah, which is grown in Paso Robles. The '06 is intricately structured, a dry wine with complex flavors of blackberries, currants, dates, mocha, leather, grilled meat, pepper and vanilla. Hard to resist drinking it now, but it should evolve in interesting ways over the next six years.
This dark-purple Cab is full of berry, horse hide and cola aromas. It's full bodied and chunky, with herbal, mossy flavors of buttery oak, salty berry and earth. A salinic, briny flavor lingers on the beefy finish.
Leafy and leathery to start, with olive, prune and herb aromas filling in the fabric. The palate has a fleshy, fairly tannic grab but the flavors are round and full, with a tack toward blackberry. Mildly herbal on the finish, which is par for the course with Chilean Merlot.
This wine is mild in acidity and simple in structure, a light-bodied take on the variety that shows flavors of green apple and green olive tapenade.
Here is a very nicely balanced Barbaresco with sweet spice notes and plump fruit tones of wild berry, cherry and blackberry. What the wine offers in harmony, it lacks in overt intensity: it shows flat, broad character in the mouth with wet earth and mineral tones on the finish.
Shows Zinfandel's rustic, rugged side, with irregular tannins, high alcohol and ripe berry fruit and spice flavors. Almost as sweet as a minor Port. Ready to drink now.
This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (43%), Merlot (31%), Petit Verdot (12%), Cabernet Franc (9%) and Malbec was assembled after just a little more than a year in barrel and then aged for an additional year in 500-liter French oak puncheons. It's 85% free-run juice and locked up with notes of graphite, dark chocolate, cassis and wood. The flavors are elegant, tart and tightly coiled, surrounded by chewy tannins that still need some time in the bottle to be tamed.
With its source of grapes from northern Burgundy, this cool, collected wine is as close to Champagne in taste as is possible. Balancing Chardonnay with some Aligoté, it is the richness of the Chardonnay that wins out, giving a ripe, creamy wine that could benefit from some bottle age. Imported by Vitis Imports.
As a contrast to the great fruity straight Touriga Nacional from the same producer, this is a much drier, firmer wine. The tannins are very dry, packed with wood flavors as well as berry fruits and layers of acidity. A wine for aging, this needs a good 5 years.
Sweetly sugary and harsh, with cherry jam flavors doused with bitter coffee.
There's a lot going on here, with a profusion of black fruit flavors underscored by an edgy ash note. The complex palate shows green olive flavors layered with blueberry pie and just the faintest hint of tannin. Tannery shop tones chime in on the finish. Drink now to 2010.
Spicy notes of angelica and an inviting, earhty warmth characterize this wine which is more slender and textured on the palate than the nose might have suggested. There is a nervy, slender core with fine acidity.
This bottling opens with clean and light yet pure aromas of peach blossoms, beeswax, rounded nectarine and sharper Granny Smith apple-skin notes. The palate is very high-toned and pithy with flavors of pear skin, Key lime, chive, sea salt and a touch of smoke, leaving the mouth with quite a sizzle on the finish.
One of a pair of comparative wines labeled Antisto. The other comes from Mendoza in Argentina. The Cahors version is lightly mineral, a soft wine feeling a little light in character. It does have the firm tannins and acidity of Cahors Malbec.
Beaucoup d'oak. Delicious, toasty, roasty, mocha-flavored oak. But the fruit is missing in action. The color suggests that there is some light, plummy fruit underlying all the oak, but it's hiding.
Showing a huge improvement over the '06, Novy's '07 Grenache is rich in chocolaty blackberry, blueberry and cherry fruit, but beautifully structured. The firm tannins and crisp acids balance out the slightly sweet jammy flavors and lead to true elegance.
Made from Pepper Bridge Vineyard fruit, this rich, deep Malbec is similar to pricey Argentine versions. It matches concentrated black fruits to generous new barrel-derived flavors of vanilla, cinnamon and Kahlua. The acidity keeps the palate propped up through the long finish.
As unevolved as they are, the dense and multilayered aromas and flavors are truly impressive here. Black currant, herb, tea, oak, vanilla, maple, anise, blueberries and more--it could be an excercise in overkill, if all the parts weren't in such fine harmony. Really big, but with excellent balance, this reveals much less now than the RWT. It is everything a flagship wine in its infancy should be--immaculate component parts, superbly full on the palate, possessed of great length and incredible potential. An absolute keeper to visit in 7, 15 or 25 years. To be released 5/01.
Waxy peach aromas seem slightly oxidized. It's round and citrusy on the palate, but in a monotone way that fades to pithy white fruits and mealy citrus. Shows some flashes of uniqueness and class; mostly it's wayward and slightly bitter.
A nutty undertow finds its way in this wine, which is marked by an earthiness of sage, clove and sous bois. Funky and desirable, it leans medium-bodied in weight and tone, with an undeniable affront of blood orange and crisp red cherry.
Basic, clean and spicy up front, this has berry and cherry aromas. It feels lively, with acidic punch and fresh flavors of wild berry, plum and vanilla. It more or less tastes the same on the finish, which has a wiry feel but otherwise comes across solid.
Boasting structure and elegance, this opens with earthy aromas of tilled soil, underbrush, woodland berry and a whiff of leather. The succulent palate shows juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry, white baking spice and chopped mint alongside firm, polished tannins. A pipe tobacco accent signals the close.
Despite reductive scents of rubber tire at first sniff, the aromas quickly open up and the wine shows round, raspberry and cherry fruit, ripe and clean. There is just a hint of light chocolate in the finish (50% new oak was used), with a tart underpinning but persistent fruit flavor throughout.
More toast than fruit even at this young stage, this is a ripe wine, showing big woody, toasty flavors that leave freshness behind. There are flavors of cream, caramel and wood here. Acidity appears on the finish.
This soft wine is very fruity, with banana and red cherry flavors, and very drinkable now. It has a bright feel to it, from the acidity and from the light, jaunty texture. Drink now.
Latour has always had the reputation of producing great wines in the less great vintages. The 2006 is a case in point. It brings structure and ripeness into a form that is almost ethereal. That elegance doesn't take away from the powerful fruit. The fruit in fact melds into the structure with ease. And, as a reminder this is a 2006, the density gives way to freshness on the finish.
Delicious and super-intense in the most beautiful way, this golden Recioto di Soave imparts aromas of honey, yellow rose, dried apricot and candied orange skin. It's sweet and thick but not in a heavy or cloying way. Lovely.
Mid-gold color. Subtle aromas of creamy stone fruit. Dry, medium bodied and fresh with bright acidity and ample fruit cocktail flavors with savory, herbal and spicy notes. Soft creamy texture and moderate length. Slightly warm and viscous on the finish finish
Here's an industrial strength Petite Sirah, from vineyards in the hotter, northern part of the valley. It's a bold, powerful wine that slams the palate with blackberry marmalade and chocolate flavors that coat the mouth and last for a long time. For all that, this only-in-California wine is fully dry. Be warned, the alcohol is 16%.
Tastes young and closed, with a little sulfur to blow off. After a few minutes, this 100% Cab starts to open, revealing polished flavors of blackberries and cherries. Should come into its own beyond 2008.
Year after year, this is one of our favorite Chardonnays from Northeast Italy. This year, however, there is an aromatic element out of place and the wine seems unable to deliver its bouquet with the same intensity. You do get exotic fruit and toasted nut but the wine really excels in the mouth thanks to its creamy, spicy flavors.
This wine is very soft and only lightly fruity. Some spice and touches of acidity give a crisp edge to the otherwise dull wine.
The blend is 59% Shiraz, 41% Grenache in this medium-bodied, low-tannin red. The aromas are dark—black cherry and plum—but the flavors are redder and juicier, with raspberry notes backed by cinnamon and clove. The label may be a bit polarizing, but the wine inside is well made and a solid value.
Made entirely with Sangiovese, this has a restrained nose that eventually reveals aromas of black-skinned fruit and leather. The straightforward approachable palate offers roasted coffee bean and dried cherry alongside round tannins. Enjoy soon.
Charcoal, cola and menthol aromas sit on top of blueberry and mint. The mouth is so tannic and powerful that it's tough to swallow. Incredibly ripe, this has a short finish that's toasty tasting and not complex in the least.
Seafood dishes (fried or lightly grilled sea prawns) or fresh vegetables would make a perfect pairing companion to this rich Tuscan white blend. The wine opens with a bright, crisp quality and offers enduring flavors of passion fruit, peach and zesty spice.
This is a full, sweeter style of Champagne. It has a touch of honey, pear and peach-jelly flavors. There's some crispness as well to give the wine a fresh edge. This style is a fine partner for fruit desserts.
Here's an easy, no-fuss white wine from central Italy (made with native Passerina grapes) that offers subtle aromas of peach and citrus over a bright, zesty mouthfeel. Pair this wine with fried vegetable tempura.
Basic Pinot, with little to recommend it beyond dryness and some decent cola flavors.
A very fine Chard, complex and layered, and quite dry. Acidity makes the tangerine, kumquat, ripe yellow pear, roasted pineapple and oaky, crème brûlée flavors really come alive. After you swallow, the wine leaves behind a delicious impression.
A good, dry Chardonnay that gets the job done at a fair price. Shows peaches and cream flavors with a bit of sharpness and green herbs on the finish.
A blend of vineyards including the winery's Mill Station site, this white shines in steely acidity and layers of lemon, lime and grapefruit flavor. Tart and tangy with a light-handed approach to ripeness, it doesn't hold back on complexity, offering subtle vanilla tones on the finish.
There's some light toast and vanilla flavors layered over modest Bosc-pear fruit, but a lack of intensity holds this wine back despite a generous mouthfeel and ample structure.
Here's a bright and plush Barbera d'Asti with a vibrant ruby color and smoke or spice notes that follow through to the palate. The wine offers bright acidity and a smooth, silky delivery.
The cool climate of Tasmania has lent this crisp white an edge of racy acidity that supports intense mineral, mango and cut grass notes. It turns somewhat softer on the finish but remains an impressive, well-balanced effort. Drink now.
Ripe blackberry, graphite and tobacco aromas become oakier with airing, making resin, vanilla and mocha notes rise up. The wine is lush and weighty in the mouth, with loamy, baked flavors of black fruits, raisin, herbs and chocolate. A smooth, textured finish is home to licorice and sweet berry flavors. Drink now through 2017.
A spicy, bold, fruit-powered take on Pinot Noir. William Hill is the proprietor. The wine comes across as sort of a California-Oregon hybrid, mixing the slightly herbal, moderately tannic Oregon grapes with a fruit-forward, cranberry core.
A little rough around the edges in tannins, with minty cherry flavors, but the wine is dry and shows some complexity in its own way. You have to give Matchbook credit for experimenting with this finicky variety. A reserve bottling would be welcome.
Plenty of crisp acidity balances the citrus, tropical fruit and pear flavors in this ripe Chardonnay. There's also a strong jacket of smoky oak with its buttered toast and vanilla richness. The result will please Chard lovers at a good price.
Attractive aromas of fresh raspberry and strawberry lead the bouquet of this wine, with secondary accents of mocha and earth. Bright and lively on the palate, with tart red-fruit flavors of currant and rhubarb that carry through to a brisk, mouthwatering finish. Drink now.
White flowers and pine fronds perfume crisp yellow peach and apricots in this delicate, yet intensely concentrated Riesling. Zesty, cutting and spry, it's a bright star for Riesling in a region traditionally not known for the variety. Made from “virgin” seedless berries known for their intense aroma and flavor concentration.
Typically semi-sweet style of rosé, crisp and clean, flavored with ripe strawberries. Good as an apéritif or with spicy dishes. Screwcap.
Punchy out of the chute, this smells mostly of dry herbs and spiced plum. It's fresh on the palate, with good body and modest depth. Juicy plum and red-currant flavors finish lightly oaked, with peppery spice and acidic tang.
This is an interesting wine that offers a nice perfume but limited flavors and complexity. So what makes it so interesting, you ask? Well, the fact that it's varietal Petit Verdot from the Duero River Valley, which is not common; that and the fact that it's a mind-boggling $200. The wine itself shows a deep color, vanilla and cocoa flavors, and a range of dark-berry flavors. Elegant and provacative, it's not.
Mellow but friendly berry aromas feed into a firm palate with tight red-fruit tannins and then ripe flavors of blackberry and chocolate cake. The finish is toasty, with a chocolate mint-chip note and acidic snap.
From vineyards quite high up in the eastern mountains, this wine is from stressed, low-yielding grapes. The blackberry and cassis flavors are concentrated and dense, and the tannins are tough and firm. Oak plays a supporting role. Rich foods, such as lamb or gongonzola cheese, will soften and sweeten it, but you're best off cellaring for a few years.
Light peach and ale notes mark the nose of this wine. The palate is dry, and the flavors somewhat flat, making it hard to ascertain the variety.
Intriguing aromas of lime zest and warm butter are enhanced by slightly botanical aromas of cut chives, kiwi and more green fruit. The palate is laced with easy flavors of apple, sea salt, dried peach and lime rind.
Smooth and spicy, this has lots of raspberry, cherry and smoky wood flavors that taste sweet and savory, but turn nicely dry and complex on the finish. It shows real class. Best over the next few years.
Jumpy and funky on the nose, with a lack of cohesion and a scent of wet dog. Feels grabby but lacks concentration; tastes herbal and mildly candied, with a scratchy and sweet tasting finish. Good but doesn't stand up to scrutiny.
This medium-bodied wine offers enticing flavors and good presence on the palate. The aromas are like forest floor, oolong tea, and ripe black cherries, while the flavors layer cherry, cranberry and clove. A firm texture carries all that flavor through the finish and keeps the taste refreshing.
Named after the steep slopes that back the Bourgeois winery, this powerful, concentrated wine shows both wonderful white and yellow fruits and a mineral character that gives a superb tension. Packed with fruit and impressively textured, it can still age. Drink from 2017.
The main nonvintage Champagne from Drappier is open, fresh and very easy. The fruit shows pears and apricots, tightened up by some green apple skins. The general feel is softness. An enjoyable apéritif Champagne.
A blend of fruit from Weinbau, Ciel du Cheval, Lady Hawk, Champoux and Obelisco vineyards, this is clearly Cabernet with its aromas of milk chocolate, herbs, vanilla, dark coffee and cherry. Flavors are rich yet supple, with a finish that lingers.
This racy white opens with scents of cut grass, tomato vine and grapefruit. The zippy, rather lean palate offers citrus, pineapple and a mineral note alongside bracing acidity.
Lightly off-dry, flavored with sweet strawberries, the wine's easy flavors are just what's needed for a casual get-together.
This is for real Pinotage lovers, so bashful drinkers, beware. The nose bursts with ripe red fruit and spice—Pinotage hallmarks—and on the palate, lively, spicy and smoky flavors of berry and savory spice abound. It's a wine full of personality and is best enjoyed with a dish of grilled spicy ribs or ethnic food that can tame its wildness.
Jammed with ripe plum, cherry and blackberry flavors, this is a big-boned yet soft, nicely spiced wine made from Zinfandel, Tempranillo, Barbera, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Grenache.
At eight-plus years, this wine is a little overripe in raisins and soft in texture, but pleasantly dry, with black currant, anise and cedar flavors offset with firm tannins.
While the nose gives little away, the palate is smooth and fruit-laden. A mix of cinnamon-scented red and black forest berries appears on the smooth midpalate which has just the slightest grip of tannin. This has a mellow, soft theme but nonetheless carries all the necessary freshness on a medium body.
This attractively soft wine is as gentle as the Gascony countryside, made with grapes from this region. It brings together many citrus flavors along with hints of pineapple and richer fruits. Drink now.
This is a very fine wine, bringing together sophisticated tannins and rich black fruits. It has structure, acidity and a juicy core that are well balanced, ripe and with great intensity. This is a serious wine from billionaire Clément Fayat and family and it is well worth aging. Drink from 2022.
Tasty and wonderfully drinkable. The basic flavors are cola and soy, with extra nuances of blackberries, cherries and quite a bit of smoky, sweet oak. Drinks very dry and spicy.
Rosacroce Sauvignon is a very pleasant and easy-drinking wine with lively aromas of stone and passion fruits. The wine is crisp and focused in the mouth and makes a great appetizer or finger food selection.
With robust aromas of cola, coffee, dry leaves and blackberry, this lusty blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec and Cabernet Franc outperforms its reasonable price tag. Despite being big and dark, the palate is juicy in feel. Flavors of cassis and black cherry are backed by chocolate and mocha, while the finish is deep and pure, with toasty notes and additional chocolate. Drink through 2018.
Pale in color, this ripe, full-bodied wine has a rich core of red fruits and spicy acidity. The wine is concentrated while still keeping elegance and fresh fruitiness. The aftertaste is full and smooth.
This is one of the least drinkable of Pride Mountain's new red wines, simply because it needs time. It's all primary fruit vs. oak now, with unintegrated blackberry, cherry, currant and mocha flavors fighting it out with smoky caramelized wood and vanilla. Tannins lurk in the background, ready to embrace both sides. Made solidly in the modern cult style of extreme ripeness and high alcohol, it's a compelling wine that should come into its own sometime late in 2010, and drink well for 6–8 years.
Attractive juicy fruit dominates this wine. It has flavors of red berry juice topped with rhubarb acidity and rounded off with sweetness. There is freshness, ripeness, the tannins just a band to hold all this forward fruit together.
Heavy, rooty aromas of stewed black plum, raisin and prune set up a thick, tannic palate that's jammy like the nose. Prune, raisin and chocolate flavors are oaky and very ripe, thus the finish is earthy, baked in feel and raisiny in flavor.
Here's a light and easy Grillo that opens with citrus, dried herb, stone fruit and honey. The wine feels fresh, compact and dry.
Outstanding fruit comes up immediately, with blue plum and ripe cherries. Tannins are smooth and polished, while the barrel aging contributes complex, well-integrated components of toast, coffee and soy.
This comes from a mountain-high vineyard atop a relatively new Sonoma County AVA that straddles into Mendocino County, too. Savory and herbal, the 100% Cab offers dark sour cherry and blackberry and plenty of tannin.
Aromas of clamshell, tree bark and berry fruits are scattereshot. This has a noticeably sticky, syrupy feel along with candied, sweet flavors of black plum and baking spices. A chunky, sticky, sweet-tasting finish lacks cut and finesse.
Ripe, fruity and jammy on the nose, with smokiness and earth to go with standard berry aromas. The palate leans towards full and jammy, with sweet berry and mild spice flavors. Chunky and full-bodied, but for the most part it gets things right.
The wine is intense, full in the mouth and rich. The warm, concentrated character brings out both ripe fruits and minerality. The result is a textured wine, tangy and citrus-driven, that also has broad yellow fruits along with the final acidity. Drink from 2016.
Red fruit and milk chocolate aromas do battle with green pepper, and while there's no clear winner, each makes its mark. The fruit seems solid and healthy, with the palate showing good tannins and acidity. But those bell pepper aromas and flavors are heavy and refuse to cease. Imported by Canandaigua Wine Co.
Although pricey for a rosé, this shows wonderful  complexity. The grapes come from two well-regarded vineyards, and the wine shows an elegant structure, with crisp acids and a dusting of tannins. It tastes of rose petals, herb tea, raspberries and nectarines.
Aromas of grapefruit and crushed tomato vine lead the nose. The ripe rounded palate offers honeydew melon, lemon drop and a note of crushed dill alongside fresh acidity.
Forest, cola and grilled mushroom flavors punctuate the experience of this light-bodied wine that's subdued in structure and soft on the palate. Blueberry and white pepper notes close out the finish.
Berry fruit and some dried apple skin come off the nose of this nicely shaped Vino Nobile di Montepulciano. Give it a few minutes to open up in the glass: you'll also get background notes of pepper, clove and wood shaving. Pair this ruby colored Tuscan wine with steak and wild porcini mushrooms.
This starts out pretty good, with melon and sweetness on the bouquet, but it feels loud and clumsy on the palate, with citrus as the sole flavor. Pulpy like grapefruit on the finish, but it's also sweet and fleshy.
Teodosio is a youthful and playful Aglianico del Vulture (usually among Italy's most austere red wines) with raw and chewy aromas of red fruit, prune and black plum. Its super-intense and tannic feel in the mouth is accented by flavors of bitter chocolate and spice.
This light offering shows berry-cherry fruit and an herb note on the nose. The palate is even and dry with bing-cherry flavors, but an evident greenness keeps the wine from blossoming fully. Finishes dry, with a mildly astringent and slightly woody note.
Truffle, game, leather and black plum aromas open this earthy, full-bodied red. The palate offers ripe blackberry, juicy black cherry, mocha, white pepper and savory herb alongside assertive, drying tannins. It ends on a licorice note.
Aromas of green-plum jelly and a touch of toast set out a wine that is spicy as well as fresh. Bitter orange marmalade flavors are laced with lime acidity, lying over a firm, tense structure with a mineral edge. It will develop well, but don't drink before 2020.
Made from 100% Barbera, this has perfumed aromatics and flavors of raspberry and peach. It's sweetness is in check—ideal for food with some heat, like Thai or Mexican.
While it doesn't have huge power, this wine does have many great attributes. It is smoothly ripe, its open structure a fine reflection of the elegant style, edged with minerality. The acidity is pure, not too dominant, but lifting the generous fruit and final dry character.
Tannins and red plums combine in this light, elegant wine. The acidity is important though, with the fruit fresh rather than warm.
From the sweet white appellation of the Bergerac region, this is a full, botrytis-dominated wine, opulent, layered with dryness to balance the citrus and honey flavors. Maybe without complexity, but certainly with all the right botrytis wine characters.
Well made, with a good mix of green apple and butterscotch, but less weight and density than some of the bigger wines. There's a bit of pineapple fruit also, hints of citrus and judicious use of the oak. The juicy fruit opens into light tropical flavors through the finish.
Lots of ripe strawberries, raspberries and sweet smoky oak in this silky young Pinot Noir. It tastes a bit too extracted and jammy for subtlety, but sure does offer a mouthful of flavor.
Stoller's reserve reflects the specific vintage conditions while retaining a stylistic throughline. In 2012, it's dark and potent, with streaks of saline, fresh herb, black olive and tart cherry. A big wine, it opens nicely with breathing time, turning into a lush, generous mouthful, with notes of cola and spice.
Raisiny and fat, not exactly the most welcoming notes. Tastes overripe and sugary, with a finish too much like sherry.
Gold in color, then waxy and baked on the nose, this Verdejo seems a bit overripe and soft. Melony on the palate, with soft flavors of waxy citrus, melon and mango, the wine lacks kick come finishing time.
Pure Cabernet Franc from the outstanding Olsen Vineyards, this avoids the stemminess that can plague this variety at times. It has a pure black-cherry flavor that is round and full bodied, with textural tannins that sail onto the delicious finish.
A beautifully fragrant but not overpowering oak aroma wafts up from the glass. The same sort of sophisticated spicy element joins in the flavors along with vivid black cherry notes supported by firm acidity, moderate tannins and medium body. It's built like a classic, but it costs much less.
More traditional than modern in style, this has aromas of citrus, herb, dry oak and medium-weight fruit. It feels crisp and tightly focused, with a complex palate that offers notes of berries, chocolate and herbs. It finishes long, with a leathery, meaty element that lends gravitas to the wine. Drink now–2016.
This wine intrigues with its aromas of peppery spices, tobacco and purple fruit. The flavors are lush and focused, bringing a lot of hedonistic pleasure, though it trails a bit toward the finish.
A fascinating feral quality wraps around this wine, redolent of mottled animal hair, raw meat and scraped earth, like the scene of a freshly hunted wild boar. Aromas of mulberry and dark strawberry also show on the nose, while the palate dives deep into turned earth, shiitake mushrooms, juniper, stewed bay leaf, wild cherry and elderflower liqueur. The acidity also pops and the texture grips firmly.
This is a nice, traditionally styled Rioja. Delivers smooth, earthy, leathery aromas and then spicy dry fruit that's right out of Rioja 101. With good acidity, it's a very respectable table wine from a weak vintage.
A firm, somewhat muscular wine, blending in 16% Merlot and aged in neutral oak barrels. Leaf and truffle notes abound, with the distinctively acidic underpinning of Sangiovese. Light strawberry-cherry fruit gently fades through a clean finish.
From Livermore-based Fenestra, this blend includes Verdelho, Riesling, Chardonnay, Sémillon and Pinot Gris, swirling them into a medium-boded, balanced wine resplendent in peach and pear. With some heft on the finish, it ends satisfyingly clean.
Concentrated blackberries mix with lush and inviting purple flowers and baking-spice notes on the nose of this appellation blend. It's juicy on the palate with minty blackberry and licorice-laced olallieberry flavors, making for easy drinking.
A combination of grapefruit zest, russet-pear peel, ripe apple and fresh lemon creates a nose and palate that are alluring, refreshing and very fruity. A bit of that zestiness is also apparent on the midpalate texture that delivers crunch, finesse and an enlivening purity. The finish is dry and long, full of moreish juiciness.
Heavy white-fruit aromas have an almost “canned” quality. This is more like citrus juice than defined white wine, with hugely ripe tropical and citrus flavors culminating in creamy weight. This is 80% Godello and 20% Doña Blanca.
This Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah blend is soft and ready to drink now. It's also very delicious, almost like a dessert pastry, with ultra-ripe black cherry, cassis, anise liqueur, melted milk chocolate and vanilla flavors that finish spicy-sweet.
Bright red cherry fruit and lively acidity give this wine an immediate burst of crispness. It has an attractive tannic character underpinning its ebullient fruitiness. Drink now.
From one of the most talented winemakers in the Rogue Valley comes this red blend, which could be labeled Malbec, as that is 88% of the blend (the rest is Cabernet Franc). The varietal character comes through nicely, wrapped in toasty oak, with lovely spice highlights around raspberry and Bing cherry fruit. Lively and textural, with a hint of funk.
Noticeably off-dry, this wine opens with spice and rose aromas shot through with mineral notes, followed by a faintly watery palate that nonetheless comes through with some lovely spiced pear flavor. Unctuous, medium finish. Serve as an apéritif.
A blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon and 30% Mavrud (an indigenous Bulgarian variety), this garnet-colored wine has a bouquet of blackberry, black plum and smoked meats. Soft tannins support the rich flavor of black plum, backed by a generous sprinkling of vanilla.
Light and spicy, this deceptively robust, ripe cherry-cola wine lingers in acidity and a roundness of tannin that makes it both lush and plush, yet balanced. The oak is supportive without being intrusive.
This is a seductive style of Pomerol. It may not have great weight, but what it does have is rich, juicy berry fruit flavors, an open structure and tannins just holding all this ripeness together.
Opulent and wood-aged, this feels intense and rounded with a ripe Burgundian feel. The full weight of the peach and apricot fruits are given a powerful push by the toast, spice and vanilla flavors. Age this for 2–3 years.
The estate's 13 acres were first planted in 1999. This lovely wine expresses itself with perfectly ripened black-cherry fruit, a dash of cola, and an underpinning of clean earth, complemented with a touch of mineral. The finish is superb.
Mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, with a drop of Cab Franc, this blend shows the type of tannins that Rutherfordians like to call dusty, and those tannins do have a finely ground latticework. But they're also astringently dry, and the underlying fruit flavors, of cherries and blackberries, don't seem rich enough to stand up to extended aging.
Mainly Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, this is a dry, full-bodied wine that shows considerable sophistication and elegance. Fruit aficionados will find a wealth of blackberries, cherries and cocoa, while structuralists will like the firm tannins and acids. Quite good now and for a few years.

The vineyard is in a theoretically warmer part of the valley, in the Windsor region, but somehow, there are unripe notes here. Despite some sour-cherry candy and pomegranate flavors, there's a green streak of asparagus. Drink the wine soon, as it's not an ager.
Here's a sweetie. With its vanilla cream, lime sorbet and raspberry purée flavors balanced by rich acidity, and at an affordable price for good bubbly, it's destined to wash down many a wedding cake.
A dry wine with firm tannins over the juicy red-cherry fruits. It is structured, while likely to develop well over the next few years. The wood and fruit are both attractive at this stage.
The majority of the grapes for this wine hail from Monterey County, with a large portion also coming from Napa County. The remaining 19% are from Sonoma County. In all, the wine is a tad simple and generic, not offering much in the way of aroma or flavor.

Solid tannins still dominate this potentially ripe and full-bodied wine. It has the richness and structure of the vintage, giving ripe red fruits from the Merlot as well as tight tannins that need to soften. Drink from 2016.

White cherry, raspberry, almond skin and cola describe the simple bouquet of this easy-going red. On the palate, it's crisp and lean.
Adelaida is assembling a good track record with this wine. It's from the cooler western portion of the appellation, so that crisp acidity provides a fine framework for the slightly sweet tropical fruit, wildflower and spice flavors. With its exotic personality, it's best paired with strongly flavored, complex dishes that combine poultry, game or shellfish with fruits, nuts and honey.
This wine over-delivers in quality for the price. It's made from mostly Cabernet Sauvignon, with handfuls of Merlot, Malbec, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc blended in to good effect.

Smells young and elusive, with earthy, green aromas masking riper notes of blackberries and cassis. There's little oak evident here.

Slightly carbonic and gassy at first, with huge candied fruit aromas. But quickly the wine settles, and out comes sweet blackberry flavors and some gumminess. It's a chunky, easy wine with medium tannins and modest plushness, which is something you shouldn't necessarily expect from a value-positioned wine. Short on the finish, but plump and buttery.
A very fine edition of River's Red, this returns Merlot to the first chair (55%) position, with Syrah and Cab Franc splitting the rest. Sturdy, chewy, bone dry, tannic and authoritative, it's a quintessential steak wine. Cassis, earth, hints of dried mushroom and those stiff but powerful tannins combine to make this a standout at the price.
This opens with rather funky aromas of scorched earth, overripe black-skinned fruit and a whiff of barnyard. The extracted palate offers mature black cherry, toast, espresso and a gamey note alongside tightly packed tannins. A note of roasted coffee bean signals the close.
Thieuley's top white, named after the owner, is an intense wine, with honey and acidity in great balance. There are flavors of almonds and vanilla from wood aging. A great white Bordeaux from the Entre-deux-Mers region.

From vines planted in 1976, this aromatic wine shows the depth that old vines can bring. Strawberry, cola, butter (from 14 months in 50% new French oak), wild cherry and more come into focus, and although delicate, they last and last on the palate. The finish is spectacular.
The most widely available bottling from Evening Land, this has a strong streak of earth and bark, with somewhat flat-tasting fruit flavors of black cherry cola. It finishes earthy and tannic, with a rough edge that may smooth out with additional bottle age.
Smells green and weedy at first, and then oak aromas rise up to cover the green overriding character. Clacky in the mouth, with green-leaning berry flavors and oak. Finishes herbal, with a lasting flavor of pole bean.
Not many wines come from Bucelas today, as its vineyards get eaten up by the northern Lisbon suburbs. This Arinto-based wine suggests there should be some more of this ultra-crisp white, which bears a passing resemblance to a Vinho Verde in its super-fresh apple and grapefruit flavors.
Rustic, simple and sharp, with earthy-berry flavors.
This classic, fresh wine has citrus flavors and a light herbal touch. It is fruity, with a light tannic edge that adds to the attractiveness of the wine.
A strongly spicy, rich wine, this has great concentration and an intense, dense texture.There is weight with plenty of ripe tropical fruits to contrast pronounced black pepper and bitter almond character. It's still young, so don't drink before 2015. Screwcap.
Kuleto has tried their hand at Sangiovese over the years, with little more success than most other California wineries that have tacked this difficult variety. The '04 is dry and one-dimensional, with cherry and herb flavors and sharp acids.

New leather, menthol, woodland berry, dark spice and a whiff of pressed rose petal are just some of the scents you'll find on this radiant red.

It's already stunning but needs time to develop to its full potential. Drink 2023–2043.

Quite pale in color, this is a faintly aromatic wine with hints of cedar, tart cherries and dried tobacco. The fruit flavors are light in style with tart acids and firm but not unyielding tannins, with lingering cranberry flavors on the finish. It doesn't quite come off but certainly piques the interest.
A lean wine, its tannins dominant. There is a barnyard character along with red cherry fruit and acidity. An edge of wood and toast comes through at the end.
This is a structured wine from 96% Merlot and 4% Cabernet Sauvignon that has plenty of fruit. With some firm tannins as well as concentrated blackberry fruit, it is going to be a fine wine. It was created under the direction of consultant Stéphane Derenoncourt's team. Start drinking from 2019.

Fresh apple notes on the nose of this off-dry sparkling are pretty, but hindered by whiffs of dust and green stems. Softly pétillant with a creamy, mouth-filling froth, it finishes with a pleasantly sweet note. An unusual blend of Pinot Franc, Chardonnay, Aligote and Riesling.
This unoaked Chardonnay is awash in green apple, tart lemon and tropical pineapple, light and lifted on the palate. It goes down easily, and will track well at the table. Salads, seafood and brunch-type fare are all good bets.
Big, impressive wine, packed with sweet tannins and black plum fruits. Smoky wood lurks in the background, while acidity tops it off attractively.
Peach-pit and stone-fruit aromas are dry and a touch bitter. Because this is so young, it's juicy and minerally in its current state, with citric acidity in the driver's seat. Nectarine and tangerine flavors finish fresh but simple.
Alluring aromas of violet, fresh herbs, mint and berry fruits are snappy and work well together. This smacks down hard in the mouth courtesy of lively acidity and tannic bite, while flavors of blackberry, toast, green herbs and tobacco finish narrow but firm.
This wine comes from a small parcel of vines planted on the marble soil found around the Estremoz area of Alentejo. It's a limited edition blend of Alicante Bouschet and Trincadeira. Almost black in color, it's a powerful, dense and beautifully rich wine. Aromatic, packed with black fruits as well as tannins that will soften, it is going to age for a many years. Drink from 2020.
With its restrained fruit, this wine is more food accompaniment than stand-alone quaff. The smoky, weedy aromas and flavors positively demand a juicy burger to bring out the underlying cassis and tobacco. —J.C.
An elegant combination of citric zest and honeyed curve typifies this wine. On the palate, rounded, luscious honey flavors are balanced by acid and a clean finish. A wine with some substance that will pair well with richer seafood.

An approachable Pinot: its feel is soft and round, and its cherry fruit falls squarely in the cherry cola camp, rather than the tart and rigid one. Starts to get serious on the finish, where firm tannins take hold. Imported by Scott Street Portfolio.
This is a strong Zinfandel. It takes over the mouth with a blast of ripe blackberry, cherry, anise, chocolate and spice. What it lacks in subtlety it more than makes up for in sheer power.

Vibrant lemon and tangerine acidity freshens savory tones of pressed apples and nuts in this slightly rustic earthy Riesling. It's dry on the palate and finishes briskly.

An intensely fruity wine with refreshing swathes of bright white fruits, this is fragrant and textured with lively acidity cutting through the creaminess. Very pure tasting with great depths. Age for 3–4 years. Screwcap.
Herbal, bordering on vegetal, yet rich and viscous in the mouth thanks to high alcohol and a dash of residual sugar.

Ripe, soft and creamy smooth, this Chard has polished flavors of pineapple jam, vanilla, pears, apple butter, honey and cinnamon.
Not an expressive Rueda but it sizzles. Despite being young and driving, it's more neutral in flavor and texture than the winery's Verdejo, which is excellent. This wine shows all citrus with light green accents, and with shrimp or Asian foods it'll do well.
Flat and loamy on the nose, and then slightly floral. There is not much going on here; the palate offers distant strawberry flavors accented by pickle, and the finish is thin, tangy and hints at tomato. A Europvin, Christopher Cannan selection, imported by multiple importers, including Michael Skurnik Wines.
Accents of sweet orange oil liven up the rich cherry and red plum aromas. The mouth is light but lively, with a fleeting coffee-infused finish. Drink now.

Given the $27 price, this “limited edition” Sauvignon is lacking in many places. The nose is challenging, with a strong scent of bathroom cleanser, while the palate delivers acid and citrusy flavors but no middle tier. On the finish, it's like scallions and tarragon, with cutting acidity.
Light in weight and subtle in flavor, this Chard is a welcome change from some of its mega-mallowy Oz compatriots. There are citrus and peach flavors on the palate and floral, yellow fruit aromas; it starts to get toasty with aeration.
Aromas of black fruits, light oak and violets are good but basic, and that pretty much defines the rest of the wine. Expect an easy flowing palate with candied, regular berry flavors in front of a light to medium finish. Nicely done and approachable.
This is a beautiful estate with an amphitheater of vines that represents one of the biggest single vineyards of Barbera in the Asti area. This particular expression ushers forth aromas of ripe fruit, smoked bacon and blackberry jam. It's clean, compact and fresh on the close.
The Genesis Cab has far more stuffing than its companion Merlot, with chewy tannins and alcohol pushing 15%. Still, it seems to lack depth, or at least the sort of appealing fruit flavors that can compensate for a lack of density. It's chewy and red, with a chalky finish that needs some sort of rich food to work through.
Understated on the nose, with hints of fresh strawberries and raspberries, this bone-dry rosé is quite penetrating on the palate, with a deep red-fruit flavor and a vein of crushed-stone minerality.
Aged for two-and-a-half years in American oak, this Petite Sirah shows off the variety's preference for aging, a study in dense, rounded tannins and juicy red and blue fruit. With savory hints of cedar wood and leather, it'll appeal to Petite fans and accompany roasts and grilled meats well.
Made without the addition of sulfites, this has untamed, raw aromas of tangerine skin, honey, ripe melon and yellow rose. The fruit was organically farmed.
A very firm and well-structured expression of pure Walla Walla Syrah. There is a core of blueberry and blackberry fruit, amply wrapped in sweetly toasty, smoky oak (despite very little new barrel usage). It finishes clean with the characteristic earthy foundation of Walla Walla Syrah, and a streak of rock and licorice.
A young wine, where the acidity and wood are still coming together with the ripe fruit. There is an edge of austere tannin that is balancing the fresh berry fruits. If this is still a great wine in progress, just wait four years and it will be serious, structured and powerful.
Simple, fruity wine, crisp, clean, laden with red fruits and touched by vanilla. The wine is light, fragrant and totally ready to drink.
From a winery better known for Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a fairly standard Zinfandel, with generous berry, tobacco, sandalwood and spice flavors. It does have lovely balance and the precision typical of Napa Valley.
The typical Côtes de Gascogne blend of Colombard and Sauvignon Blanc, this is crisp, brightly herbaceous, hinting at peach as well as lime juice. It is fresh, clean and deliciously fruity.
This is the winery's top bottling from the estate vineyard, off Highway 29 in St. Helena. Mostly Cabernet Sauvignon, it shows the variety's blackberry and cherry flavors, with notes of violets and milk chocolate. New oak to the tune of 70% adds a rich, caramelly smokiness. Very delicious, and should develop for a few years, although the softness limits longterm cellaring.
Despite its richness, this is a stylish wine that exudes freshness as much as dense fruit and structure. A blend of Touriga Nacional, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon, all structured varieties, it still yields a generous full-bodied and rounded wine. It does need to age, so drink from 2018.
This is warm and round, with red fruit flavors that are attractively displayed against a backdrop of soft tannins. The acidity lends crispness, highlighting the ripe fruit on the finish.
A lively, fresh, red-fruited wine, with a good balance between new wood flavors, spice and intense fruit. This is a great wine to drink now, with its direct fruit flavors backed with tight tannins.
Dusty cherry aromas start out full and turn more green and grassy with time. Sweet grapefruit and tang carry the palate, and the finish is a rush of acidity. Good but odd.

Baked blackberry and licorice show on the nose of this Super Tuscan-style blend of 60% Sangiovese and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon. It combines Old World and New World elements well, its rocky minerality framing baked blackberry fruit, underpinned by chalky tannins and steady acidity.
Cristom's reserve is a blend of 11 different vineyards, and makes a strong case for this approach over the single vineyard mania that has gripped Oregon for years. This is a big, concentrated wine, still hard and tight, with raspberry/blackberry fruit focused and lifted by tart acids. Just a light touch of oak balances it out.
With a salty oak entry, this wine invites, showing a touch of reduction and strong barrel presence. Crème brûlée and baked apple give it a richness and length that presents as juicy and fleshy.

This ripe wine is smooth and creamy, fresh with acidity and rich with red fruits. Open and generous, it will make a great apéritif.
A delicate, silky mouthfeel makes this wine feel light and vibrant, yet there's nothing light about the flavors. Notes of wild cherries, cranberries, Dr. Pepper, anise, pine and savory spices explode on the palate, and they lead to a long, dry finish. Give it 5–6 years in the cellar.

Craggy's style of Sauvignon Blanc has always favored texture over flamboyant aromatics, but the 2014 offers subtle notes of tomato stalk layered over citrus fruit. Grapefruit predominates, but there's a hint of stone fruit and the hallmark Craggy creaminess to the wine's texture.
Waxy plum and a surprising characteristic of watermelon provide a subtle freshness to this otherwise hugely tannic, concentrated wine. Tar and yeast play a role as well.

More sweet than semi-sweet, and very stylish. The nose offers a full blast of maple, citrus rind and honey, while the delicious palate overflows with dried apricot, fig, dates, pepper and chocolate. This is a sherry that excels in the area of mouthfeel: it's lithe, almost lean, but still packed and upright. And the finish, which is just spicy enough to offset the sweetness, goes on forever.
This wine has faint floral aromas and a note of the tropical, built around an unfussy core of caramelized oak that manifests as crème brûlée.

A serviceable Syrah, with somewhat muted blueberry and huckleberry fruit, pepper and herb. Medium concentration, with more of the herbal and stem flavors coming through in the tannins.
This is big, muscular and very opulent, with its density lying over its minerality. Flavors of black stone fruits and red berries have the intensity of a powerful, age-worthy wine.
Acidity stars in this Rhône-style blend, based on Viognier. The off-dry tropical fruit, floral and vanilla honey flavors are too simple to earn a higher score.
Rollat's Sophie occupies the entry-level rung on the ladder, behind the elegant and polished Rollat and the dense, compact and highly cellar-worthy Edouard. But Sophie is charming and accessible, a blend of 50% Merlot, 40% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Cabernet Franc that is elegant and bright.

From an estate vineyard off Olivet Lane in the heart of the Santa Rosa Plain, this wine is comparatively intense and meaty compared to some of its counterparts from the cooler Sebastopol Hills. Earthy mushroom and a tart, tangy note of orange give it a lift, along with a light layering of fresh-cut rose, before finishing in richer, dark chocolate.
A classic blend of Cabernet and Shiraz, this is cedary and complex upon opening, easily mixing cassis, plum and blackberry with vanilla and baking spices. On the palate, it's dense and concentrated yet slightly reserved, suggesting rather than screaming its potential. A long, mocha-tinged finish wraps things up, combining dusty tannins with mouthwatering acids. Drink 2020–2030+.

The best bottle in a strong 2010 William Church lineup, this pure, single-vineyard Malbec is flat-out lovely. Deep purple fruits—plums and cherries—meet silky tannins and just the right touch of French oak, a mix of new, once used and neutral. Young, compact and dense, it should reward up to a decade of cellaring.

This wine came out of the disaster of shriveled Duras grapes after an especially hot period. Rather than discarding them, Domaine Rotier made a wine. Wood aged, it has many of the characters of a late harvest with its rich, sweet, lightly tannic flavors and sufficient acidity to balance. A surprising success.

Overall this is a very bright and nicely defined wine.
This is a classy bottle of bubbly from the light copper color to the lightly fruity, yeasty aromas to the crisp mouthfeel and satisfying spice and raspberry flavors. A sense of layered richness is balanced by good acidity for balance.

This Malbec-Merlot-Tannat blend from northerly Salta is bright purple in color, with compact aromas of wood smoke, graphite, ink and blackberry.

It's very pretty, a thinking person's Cabernet.
This Riserva takes on an elegant, harmonious personality and boasts delicate notes of berry fruit and vanilla in the background. It's not particularly thick or extracted, nor is it meant to be. Instead, it is elegant and easy on the senses and offers tight, chewy tannins.
This is a tangy, not entirely varietal wine that's dense in black tea and black fruit, with layers of tobacco and dried herb. Give it time in the glass to open.

It's very dry and crisp in acidity, and seems to have the inherent balance to mellow with 4–6 years in the cellar. Give it a try.
Caprili brings us a beautifully elegant and shapely Brunello that is enhanced by plump cherry and wild berry nuances. Subdued tones of vanilla and spice add a nice touch of zest on the long finish.
Oily and frankly a bit skunky on the nose. The palate is spritzed yet soft, with chunky, blowsy, generic white fruit flavors. Doesn't inspire; this winery's red wines are better.

Rich, upfront raspberry and cherry pie, tart red currant and sweet sandalwood flavors mark this Pinot. It's not one to age, but shows plenty of Russian River Valley style and flash.

This joint venture between Nicolas Jaboulet and the Perrin family is turning out some good examples from the Northern Rhône, like this Côte Rôtie, which is plummy, yet at the same time loaded with savory notes of cured meat and smoke, even a hint of bacon fat. Silky tannins frame the finish. Drink now–2017.
A wealth of notions hits the palate: baked apple, fir honey, lemon-scented caramel and burnt sugar.

Caramel-crusted apricots glow in the background while everything is lit up with bright, fresh acidity, highlighting apricot, apple and honey.

Fresh young cherry-berry aromas, with a kiss of oak, lead to extracted, jammy, full-bodied flavors that explode in the mouth. Soft, luscious and round, there's lots of immediate pleasure here.
Nicely balanced and a better example of the upside of Navarra than the wines that are based on or include Merlot. The nose shows some herbal character but more deep fruit notes. And in the mouth there's ripe cherry, cassis and plum. Texturally, it's very nice, and when you get down to the nuts and olts it's a very good value.
Big for a Pinot Noir, but that's Santa Lucia and Tondre for you. It could almost be Grenache, but it sure is delicious. Floods the mouth with raspberries, cherries, spices and oak; full-bodied, with some hefty tannins, but it never loses Pinot's essential silkiness. Drink now–2015.
Not a lot of American importers bring in Coonawarra Shiraz, as the region is better known for its Cabernet. This is a fine example of the former, offering a hint of eucalyptus or mint alongside vanilla, mocha and raspberries. There's a fine, silky texture and a long supple finish.

This is a good-value wine with broad appeal, and a pretty sophisticated, chalky texture for the price. Its blackberry-oak-amaretto profile has an interloping strawberry note that wasn't a high point for me, but adds an approachable streak of red to an otherwise dark Shiraz. Imported by Southcorp Wines.
Aromas of yellow flower, candied orange zest and a balsamic note emerge in the glass. On the enveloping palate, a ginger note accents baked Gala apple and eucalyptus honey. Fresh acidity brightens the rich flavors.
Technically, this Gewürz has a residual sugar of 0.8%. Taste-wise, that gives it a round, honeyed softness that nicely balances the high acidity, and makes the pineapple, guava and lychee flavors taste like they're baked into a rich, savory pie. An enormous blast of Asian spices kicks in on the finish.
A structured wine from limestone soil. You can taste the tannins from the fruit skins. At the same time, there is great acidity and crisp, zesty green currants.
This is a soft, fruity blend of Roupeiro, Rabo de Ovelha and Fernão Pires. It is ripe, full of apple and crisp green fruits, shot through with acidity. Drink now.

From a good vintage, this wine with its blend of 60% Pinot Noir and 40% Chardonnay has a pale gold color and attractive maturity. The initial fruitiness has given way to a mineral-textured wine with a touch of almonds, spice and a rich character. It is ready to drink.
This wine has a nose of lemon peel, lemon grass, and a freshly cut lawn. It is clean in the mouth, with flavors of lemon, lime and Seckle pear that wind down to a mineral-laden finish.
This light and fresh Sémillon is all Walla Walla Valley fruit, with 12% Sauvignon Blanc in the blend. Apples and pear-skin flavors carry a hint of cinnamon. Lighter in the mouth than previous Amavi Sémillons, this elegant wine would be a good match to light seafood and shellfish.
This 100% Merlot from the Entre-deux-Mers, made in the style of a grand cru, is rich, spicy and full of superripe blackberry flavors. From low yielding, high density vines, it is big and concentrated, with hints of wood under the weight of the fruit.
Roberts Road is one of the Sangiacomo family's coolest-climate sites, and it offers light, clear color and deliciously floral notes of violet and rose on the nose. In taste it is earthy and full of dark plum and black cherry, the backbone deeper and darker in mushroom and fresh dirt.
A rich, ripe and complex Cabernet, with classic Napa tannic structure. Not quite up there with the winery's higher-priced Dollarhide or Elu bottlings, but showing similar elegance and taste. Brims with blueberry, mocha and cedar flavors that should develop over the next four years.
Harsh, acidic and bitter, with a green, minty streak, this is an unrewarding Cabernet.
This wine is crisp, taut and with a strong mineral texture. Spice and green-fruit flavors are shot through with acidity and have a steely edge. Hold the wine until late 2017 for it to soften.
The subtlest overtones of pine and mint hover above the rather citrus-focused nose that also comes with a good dose of white pepper. The palate reverberates with savory, herbal spiciness. A cooler vintage has turned the usually very nutty and rounded Neuburger into a spicier but equally interesting food companion. Lemon zest and pepperiness provide a lasting finish.
Made by the same team as Château de France in Pessac-Léognan, this is an attractive, forward wine. It shows the juicy character of the vintage, although the tannins do give it structure and some weight. A wine for medium-term aging: 4–5 years.
Made from the two Cabernets plus Merlot, this is a forward, tasty but somewhat one-dimensional red wine. It has jammy blackberry, cherry, blueberry and chocolate flavors and smooth tannins. Drink now.

This pristine expression of Grillo opens with dry aromas of hay and crushed white stone followed by melon, citrus, pear and white almond. There's a spicy touch of white pepper on the close.
A vigorous wine. In its youth it's bright and jammy in raspberries, cherries and currants, with fine, silky tannins and citrusy acidity, like a squeeze of lime. There's oak here, too. A bit disjointed now. Give it 3–4 years in the cellar to knit together.
While there are tannins, they are not as powerful as the appellation and year would suggest. Instead, there is bright acidity, strawberry flavors and a fresh feel.
Thickly moussed, Roederer's Brut, 60% Chardonnay blended with 40% Pinot Noir, aged two years on yeast is affordable and luxurious.

It's an ideal marriage of bright acidity and ripe fruit character.
NEXT is a new label for King Vintners, a new division of King Estate. This blends grapes from southern Oregon and the Willamette Valley, putting a pleasing toasty character around the light red fruit. A streak of burnt coffee suggests that the barrel influence is still being integrated.
A hint of buttered popcorn sits atop scents of ripe yellow apple, peach and lemon custard on the nose of this wine.

There's ample acidic cut to the mouthfeel, lending balance and freshness that lasts through the finish. Drink now–2019.
Good acidity on this clean, vibrant wine, with interesting pineapple, orange, pear and honeysuckle flavors. If you like your wines a little sweet, try it as an interesting alternative to Sauvignon Blanc or Pinot Gris.
Offering buoyantly fresh fruit and mineral intensity, this Pinot Noir rosé is well worth finding in quantity to enjoy year-round, not just as a summer quaffer. Zesty acidity and a light, finely textured body are amplified by plump, fresh raspberry and peach flavors. Its briskly mineral finish is exhilarating.
The aromas are vibrant, with notes of flowers, jasmine, lime and peach. The palate drinks a hair off dry, with the concentration coming off as light but still providing interest.
Quite heavy; in fact, a touch too much. The nose is defined by corn and apple cider, while the palate is heavy and melony, with a lot of unbounded sweetness and softness. Needs more overt acidity and citrus to achieve proper balance.

Made by Ric Forman from Zin grown on the Nichelini Vineyard in Chiles Valley and Sangiovese from the Antinori family's Antica Vineyard on Atlas Peak, this wine is rich and dense in red fruit that's layered and ripe. Aged for a year in used Burgundy barrels, it retains juicy freshness and elegance, with subtle touches of vanilla and baking spice.
La Casetta is released later than this producer's other Ripasso (Torbe) to achieve more complex aromas of licorice, cured meat and candied fruit. Cantina di Negrar is one of the Valpolicella's biggest realities in terms of case production. —M.L.

Oak spice, bramble, toasted almond, chocolate, spice, dark fruit and rum cake all make appearances. This is tight, firm, straightforward yet generous. The oak element will soften with more years of cellar aging. Save for 5–10 years.
Green hints of moss and ivy play with notes of wet pebble. This is playful and lively, fresh and so easy to drink. Enjoy while the flavors are at their aromatic peak.
From old vines and with 17 months' wood aging, this is a smoothly ripe wine, the structure softened out, giving dusty tannins, great ripe black plum fruits and balancing acidity. It could be drunk now, but for the super-ripe fruit to meld even better, give it a year.
Delicate aromas of lemon blossom and orchard fruit come together in the glass. Made with 85% Vermentino and 15% Nuragus, this is soft and round, with ripe yellow apple, juicy peach and a mineral note. It's brightened by just enough fresh acidity.
De Toren's Merlot-based Bordeaux-style blend also includes 15% Cabernet Sauvignon, 14% Cabernet Franc, 12% Malbec and 4% Petit Verdot. It leads with earthy aromas of black-currant leaf, fresh tobacco and menthol that support the black-fruit core of plum, cherry and fig. The palate is full and round, but with enough tannic structure to keep it from feeling too rich or opulent. A toasty cocoa accent lingers long on the close. Drink now–2017.
This is an especially delicious Barolo that relies on dark concentration and impressive aromatic intensity to make its point. Balsam notes of cola and root beer are set against bright fruit and spice. The wine's solid structure is enhanced by a soft, velvety finish.
On the plus side, there's a smoky, meaty set of aromas. But on the down side, there's a rubbery character reminiscent of burnt tire tread. That rubbery element passes through to the flavors, which also bring roasted berry into the fold. Rustic stuff with just enough bold berry fruit to make it worth a go.
Gorgeous aromas of toasty oak, wood smoke, minerals and layered black fruits feed into a concentrated, thick palate that demands a knife and fork for dissection. Flavors of toast, vanilla bean, woodspice, bacon, mint and blackberry are lush. Give this beauty another couple of years, then drink through 2022.
One of the second wines of Château Ramage la Batisse, this is the better of the two. It shows ripe and juicy black fruits that push through the dense structure to promise a rich future. It's worth aging this wine for 3–5 years and more.
Herbaceous and earthy, this playfully ponders the juicy delights of soft, red raspberry and black cherry, the wine somewhat silky on the tongue. It finishes consistently and bright in acidity.
Elysium is crafted from Black Muscat grapes grown in the Central Valley near Madera and it tastes of raspberry jam and citrus peel, thick in texture but holding on to enough acidity to balance itself out.

A lean, unbalanced, hot wine, whose blackberry flavors have an edge of vegetables.
Lightly briny aromas of citrus set up a tight, grabby palate. This wine is a touch sour and pithy, with cantaloupe notes. A pithy, tangy finish is dry and basic.

A spicy tobacco and dark fruit nose leads on this elegant Cabernet, followed by luscious flavors of plum, clove, tobacco and a touch of oak.

Mineral, mulberry, dried herb and black-fruit aromas lead to layered dark-fruit flavors that show intensity as well as exceptional balance. This has a delicious factor that is impossible to ignore.
A soft, lush and delicious Cab. At its best now and soon, in order to appreciate the sexy waves of chocolate, blackberry jam, raspberry purée, butterscotch and cedar flavors, with just a touch of sweet funk.
Shows pretty good concentration and depth on the nose, where it only slightly hints at the herbal character that comes later. The palate is a touch astringent, with cola, blackberry and herbal flavors. Persistent on the finish, but also herbal and not overly complex.
This tart, sleek, pretty wine shows bright strawberry and raspberry fruit. Quite young and fresh, it's still rather tight and stubbornly closed, even after breathing for a full 24 hours.

Aromas of spring wild flowers come together with a subtle hint of peach. The savory palate delivers citrus, grapefruit and a crisp pear along with a note of white almond.
Fresh, ripe, inviting and 180° opposite of this producer's white cavas, which seem bubbly and fizzy compared to this balanced, subtle, even smoky offering. In the mouth, it's tasty and dry, with cherry nuances going stride for stride with pink grapefruit and raspberry. A refined rosé Cava that's sure to light your fire.
This opens with aromas of new oak, burned rubber, raisin and vanilla. The one-dimensional palate offers candied date, fig, mocha and licorice alongside bracing, grainy tannins that leave a mouth-puckering finish. It lacks the fruit richness needed to stand up to the oak spices and astringent tannins.
A big power-driven wine, all concentrated spice and sweet fruit. Lovers of Alsace wines will appreciate the richness of this wine, with its flavors of white fruits touched with pepper and its rounded, opulent texture.

Kind of big for a value wine, with aromas of plum and berry along with shoe polish and chocolate. The palate has some richness but not too much depth or weight, while the flavors of blackberry and baked plum are convincing. Finishes soft and short, with cola and candied notes.

92—94 Barrel sample. A fat, full wine, this is rich, intense, concentrated. Great layers of botrytis and apricot flavors give it attraction and power.—R.V.
The addition of Viognier in the blend is enough to make this Syrah feel tartly acidic and strangely bright in citrus fruits. The limes almost swamp Syrah's underlying cherry-berry and currant flavors. It's a good, bold wine, but an adventurous anomaly for a varietal Syrah. Drink it now.
Aromas of ripe ruby-red grapefruit mix with scents of wet sand in this stainless-steel and cold-fermented white. It delivers plush melon, citrus and a bit of bubble gum on the palate before ceding to powerful acidity. There is perhaps something disjointed in the ripe fruit flavors meeting up with bracing acidity, but it's a memorable sipper nonetheless.
This white blend—an assemblage of Clairette (40%), Bourboulenc (30%), Grenache Blanc (20%) and Ugni Blanc (10%)—is geared toward maximum freshness. It's flinty up front, with fruity notes reminiscent of citrus and fennel fronds that are bright, clean and zippy on the finish.
This is jammy and almost bubble gum-like upfront, with candied cherry flavors and very little tannic structure. Still, the fruit is bold, balanced by crisp acids, and the wine would pair fine with pizza or burgers.
This is a hard-edged wine with a chemical character. It's tough both in tannins and extracted fruits.
The opening boasts fresh red-berry aromas and prickle. Feels racy and energetic, with zesty red-cherry and red-plum flavors. Edgy, jumpy and mostly harmonious, but more tangy than deep, rich or complex.
Apple and melon aromas are basic. This feels round, with moderate acidity. Flavors of citrus, peach and nectarine are competent, while the finish takes on a salty note as it loses its fruit character.

This new winery located just outside of Prosser hits the ground running with a luscious, viscous, creamy Pinot Gris that tastes like a pear-flavored creamsicle. The fruit is almost tropical, right at the edge of mango/banana, but not fat or flabby. This is a perfect sipping wine. Screwcap.

Seems past its peak already, with fading color and aromas, and flavors of sweaty leather and sour cherries. Candied and liqueur-like on the finish. Imported by Winemonger.
Deep, lavish and creamy aromas of fudge, espresso, cola, vanilla and perfectly ripe black currants and berrries greet the nose with measured force.

The woody angles will intensify with age; drink 2018–2032.

Cheerful but basic raspberry aromas and flavors is what this young Rioja is about. It feels a little bulky at first, and then acids swell up to cut it short. Almost snappy in the late innings.

Something of a fruit bomb, with massive cherry, raspberry, currant, mocha and granola flavors, wrapped into a lightly tannic body. Brisk acidity fortunately provides balance to the fruit. Drink now.
Smoke and dark-inflected notes of espresso and cacao are front and center, wrapping into the core of cassis. Hints of prune and coffee liqueur complement chewy tannins, that lend further substance and depth. This punches well above the listed alcohol.
Still the king of South American Pinot Noir, Chacra's “55” offers a beautiful amalgam of dusty Middle Eastern spice aromas along with raspberry, cherry and cocoa notes.

Best from late 2010 through 2013.
Firm and structured, it has acidity allied to ripe black currant and berry fruits. With solid tannins in the background it needs time to soften. Drink from 2016.

A bit tart and disjointed now, and dominated by oak, with flavors of butterscotch, pineapples, green apples and cinnamon spice. But it's young. Give it time. Should knit together in early 2010.
The Lewis vineyard is already proven as a first-rate site for Syrah. This new entry in Va Piano's black label series verifies it once again. Elegant and complex, it sends up subtle citrus scents, along with concentrated flavors of bush and berry, licorice, mocha and smoke. The details pile on and the finish lingers gracefully.
This oak-fermented wine may have little connection to the Douro, but it is a full, ripe and tropical-fruit flavored. The toast is only perceptible in the smooth creaminess of the texture while acidity and a crisp lemon edge give the wine an attractive final lift. Drink from late 2016.

Here's a simple ripasso, with aromas of raspberry and black pepper. The palate is a bit lean but offers bitter cherry, licorice and white pepper notes. This will match well with gnocchi in cheese sauce or mushroom risotto.

The aromas offer notes of red fruit, spice and green wood, seeming hot. The cranberry and raspberry flavors are elegant and bring a better sense of balance, though the wood pokes out.
What a great Zinfandel this is. It's lusty and hearty, just the way you want a Zin to wash down barbecue, but it also has balance and even elegance, despite the high alcohol. The ripe blackberry and cherry flavors are jammy, complexed with spicy tobacco and chocolate, and a pure finish of cassis.

This amber-hued wine is Josko Gravner's calling card, and it not only helped kickoff Italy's orange wine movement, but it put the native grape Ribolla Gialla on the map. Delivering dried apricot, orange zest, saline, resin, ginger, anise, dried herb, nut and a blast of smoky mineral, it has an extreme character. While it's not for everyone, it's an impressive effort that combines structure, restraint, depth and complexity. Serve only slightly chilled. Drink through 2027.

It's easy to pour, and should stay fresh for weeks due to the vacuum packing.
This mélange of seven different grapes is assembled from the wine left after Brian Carter puts together his front-line blends, the same juice vinified in exactly the same way as that in the higher-priced wines. Ripe fruit, polished tannins, and a lengthy, tasty finish of chocolate-covered cherries.
The wine is ripe, rich with full apricot and red apple fruits. It shows a creamy wood-laden character that is spicy and toasty. It's very ready to drink.
Floral potpourri, mango and apple aromas are inviting on this slightly off-dry Gewürztraminer. The palate is subtle with apple and pear flavor, and finishes slightly tart.

Soft citrus notes of clementine are streaked with fresh lemon to create this fresh, fruit-driven but very appetizing wine. The body is slender, dry and totally refreshing.
Call me traditional, but 100% American oak (roughly one-third new) doesn't quite harmonize with sparkling Shiraz, at least in this instance. It's given a sappy, resiny, almost hoppy character that lingers on the palate, marrying uneasily with the black cherry fruit.
The blend includes 22% Cabernet Sauvignon, and was aged in 22% new (mostly French) oak. A streak of caraway and pepper suggests less than optimal ripening, though the fruit reaches tart black cherry concentration. Tannins are a bit astringent.

Although this is almost red in color and entering its twilight, it's not bad for $8. Dusty berry aromas lead to a semifull palate with raspberry, cherry and plum flavors that end in chewy dryness.
There's heavy wood here, a powerhouse of toast. The fruit is subdued at this young stage, but is here, so give this ripe and potentially juicy wine time to integrate.
Give this wine some airing out to let the SO2 blow off, and it will reward you with a pleasant mix of orange peel, sweet citrus and honeydew fruit. The residual sugar is 1.35%, but it feels a bit sugary in the mouth—definitely in the off-dry camp. Some of the fruit is from a 1973 Sagemoor block, among the oldest Riesling in Washington.
An ideal party pour, with a slight mint-herb tang to the fresh, lemon-lime flavors. There's even a hint of toast or biscuits that adds complexity. Tart and light, this would best as an apéritif.

This wine is a “product” in every sense of the word. It's consistent from year to year, and if you know Esmeralda, with its sweet blend of Moscatel and Gewürz, then you know that it delivers simple but pleasant lime, kiwi and cantaloupe flavors with a certain watery freshness.
Soft, herbal and very fruity, with ripe blackberry, cherry and black raspberry flavors. The herbs show up as a background note of sage and dill. Polished and dry, with earthy tannins, and best now–2011.

This wine never saw any oak. What you get is what the grapes contributed, which is pure, intense tangerine and lime fruit, brightened with brisk acidity. It's a chiseled wine, but there's a streak of honey that relieves it.

The nose on this bottling from the pioneering regional winery, now run by its namesake's son, is lush and dynamic, with black cherry, cola and vanilla-laced pie crust on the nose. Finely polished tannins carry very smooth flavors of blackberry, soy-driven umami, crushed graphite, light cedar and a pinch of herbs.
A lovely example of mature Ventoux, revealing the sunny nature of the 2007 vintage in its velvety tannins and hints of chocolate and warmth. Raspberry and plum fruit carry a faintly peppery-herbal edge. Drink now–2016.
Here is a very pretty pale-salmon-colored sparkling wine, with fine, zesty bubbles and an appealing whiff of Pinot Noir in the nose. The flavors are pure strawberry, a tiny bit sweet but not too much. This is the sort of sparkling wine even people who say they don’t like wine will fall in love with.
Reciso (a Sangiovese-based wine from Tuscany) opens with nutty aromas of toasted almond or hazelnut followed by warmer tones of red fruit and mocha. The wine is textured and grainy, and fresh acidity caps the experience.
Though the term late harvest would suggest a sweet, dessert wine, this is more on the off-dry side of Riesling, with juicy acids that cut the impression of sugar. Fragrant with scents and flavors of apricots, apple pie, honey and biscuit, it is expressive, nicely balanced and loaded with flavor.
Darkly concentrated, boldly aromatic and intense, this pretty Brunello delivers modern aromas of chocolate, espresso bean, ripe fruit, blackberry and rum cake. The mouthfeel is smooth and rich, and the wine maintains its momentum thanks to the softness of its texture.
A fresh, fruity nose with hints of spice lend an alluring start to this Chardonnay, but on the palate, flavors run a little thin.  That said, an appealing toasted oak spice character adds dimension.
Owned by Xavier Chassagnoux, who also has vineyards in Fronsac, this estate has produced a rich wine. It has the typical fruity character of the vintage with its soft tannins and juicy acidity. Red berries are lightly supported by the open structure. Drink the wine now.
The berry, herb and coffee aromas are light and are followed by high-toned potpourri notes. It's full in feel but with lighter-styled flavors, with the tannins showing some astringency.
Made with 100% Schiava, this has a subdued nose that eventually reveals red berry and iris. The palate offers crushed raspberry and a hint of marzipan alongside somewhat drying tannins and brisk acidity.
Steven Kent Mirassou is practically single-handedly reviving Livemore Valley's historic reputation for Cabernet Sauvignon. The wine shows a wonderfully lush structure and impeccable tannins, framing slightly herbal, dusty flavors of blackberries, blueberries, cherries and cedar. Really fine, and a superb accompaniment for rich meats and cheeses.
Here's a beautifully aged expression of Nebbiolo with polished aromas of blackberry, cola and scented candle. Background aromas of pressed flowers and potpourri emerge after a few minutes in the glass and the wine evolves nicely in the mouth as well thanks to its silky tannins and natural acidity.
Slightly herbal on the palate, this wine takes red fruit notes of raspberry and pomegranate to a stridently tart level. It's compact and linear, with a crisp finish.
This extreme coastal vineyard behind Cambria delivers extremely pungent herbal aromas of bay leaves, incense, eucalyptus oil and pine, proving intensely intriguing and pleasing, like a walk through the wet pine forest. Similar elements show on the palate, with rosemary, wild mint, juniper and pine-needle tea spicing up the condensed plum flavors.
Everything about this blend of 85% Cabernet Sauvignon, 5% Merlot, 5% Cabernet Franc, 3% Malbec and 2% Petit Verdot is elegantly unique. An intensely focused aromatic line of blueberry, tomato leaf, dried tobacco, black olive and lanolin on the nose leads into intriguing flavors of cardamom and chai spice. Cedar shavings, fennel and crushed olives also show on the expertly structured sip.
Crop yields were down substantially in 2010, so perhaps that is why so many of the top estates' entry-level wines are so exciting. This one combines hints of wet stones and moss with multifaceted citrus nuances and struck flint, resulting in remarkable complexity. It's round and mouthfilling yet focused and long.
A rugged red, harsh in texture and semi-sweet, with medicinal cherry flavors.
From 100% Pinot Noir, here is a delicious, crisp, wild raspberry- and mulberry-flavored wine. The acidity shines through the fruit skin texture, giving a mouthtingling feel.
While Argentine Malbecs aren't textbook cellaring wines, this one has enough spirit, tannin and structure to benefit from a few years on its side. Now, it's lush on the nose, with ripe berry, pencil eraser, vanilla and marzipan aromas. The palate is chewy but well built, with dense blackberry, cassis, coconut and chocolate flavors. On the finish, things only intensify. Will be at its best around 2015–2016.
Value-level Chardonnay has never really been Argentina's strong suit, but this fuller-bodied version is pretty good. It starts with citrus, orange peel and some dusty scents, which are backed by melon, apple and citrus flavors. It finishes with some pithy bitterness but overall it's nice for Mendoza Chardonnay.
Warm and round, this Mâcon has ripe melon and peach flavors that come with a citrusy edge. It has an attractive floral character that brings out the light minerality and acidity on the finish.
A first-rate wine, with well-ripened flavors of blackberries, espresso, cola, tea, and bitter chocolate, but made more interesting by fresh acidity not often seen in today's better Merlots. This cool-climate wine also has sturdy tannins that suggest mid-term aging.
From a great dessert wine year, this is packed with botrytis, unctuous in texture, rich and liquor-like. It is not for aging, but is delicious now.
A bit quick on the finish, but otherwise a nice everyday Chardonnay. Shows a soft, buttercream texture, with dry, subtle flavors of pineapples, pears and buttered toast.
Substantial fruit flavors and a lightly sweet balance give this medium- bodied wine a decent drinkability factor. The mouthfeel is slightly tannic and the finish is brief.
This is a signature wine for winemaker Cristiano van Zeller. It has all the dense structure of a powerful Douro wine, layers of fruit and acidity and a richly juicy aftertaste. It is still developing its power, so wait to drink until 2017.
Martin & Weyrich continues to struggle with this difficult variety, just like everyone else who tries it in California. The wine retains its naturally high acids and hard tannins, and the cherry and leather flavors have a Paso-style sweetness that makes the finish sugary.
This Proprietor's Reserve Grenache is one of a handful of Maryhill's 2010 reds that improves upon the previous vintage. Sappy and relatively substantial, this has a core of Bing cherry, along with chewy tannins and an earthy finish.
A potentially polarizing wine, the 2005 Idyll Vineyard Shiraz boasts a complex bouquet that ranges from meaty and gamy to stewed fruit and coffee and green olive. It's likeable in a stinky-cheese way. In the mouth, the tannins are soft and Pinot-like, but the wine does show a trace of heat, adding a chocolaty note on the finish.
Most of the estate vines used for this blend date back to the mid-1970s. It emphasizes bright citrus flavors, like lemon and lime, with lemon verbena, cilantro and other fresh herb notes that add detail to the finish. A very fine value, it can also age for a decade or longer.
A crisp, fruity, unoaked Chardonnay. It has bright apple and fresh squeezed lime. This is very light and finishes with great acidity. Screwcap
A structured, concentrated and classically crafted 100% Cabernet Sauvignon. Sanguine red currant and rhubarb combine with darker, more brooding tangles of blackberry and clove to define this beauty, enhanced by a velvety texture and lingering accents of cedar, pine and dried herb.
Pricey for a blush wine, but this is an excellent one, among the best rosés of the year. It's fairly dark in color and full-bodied, but very rich in strawberry and spice flavors, and the finish is smooth and dry.
This stylish Cab is loaded with black olive and black fruits, all with a leafy edge. Still young, tannic and a bit hard, it has good, clean varietal character and good length. What it needs is more bottle age; all the right components are in place for a medium-term cellar candidate.
A lovely, fresh wine, relatively pale in color with orange-ruby notes, and far lighter in body than most other Central Coast Grenaches. There's a Pinot Noir-esque quality to the silky delicacy. Flavorwise, it's all about cherry, cola, raspberry, Mandarin orange tea, smoky vanilla, Asian spices and white pepper. A savory, distinctive red wine with just a touch of oak.
Wet slate, raspberry and rose water aromas reveal the Grenache base to this Rhône blend. On the palate, dried cherries and goji berries mix it up with persistent florals, dill and wispy tobacco flavors. Though lighter in color and body, this would pair will with hearty fare, such as beef stew.
Tastes bitter and raisiny, and the cola and cherry flavors are thin. Doesn't offer much richness.
This is a lean, thin expression of Falanghina with aromas of stone fruit, apricot and candied fruit. It has a watery, simple feel and ends with easy, crisp freshness.
Ripe and full in the mouth, this rich wine features juicy black fruits and aromatic acidity. Piled high with berry flavors, it's ready to drink.
This blend of Syrah, Mourvèdre, Carignan, Counoise, Grenache and Cinsault immediately appeals with its aromas of plum, candied raspberry and garrigue, with no oak influence anywhere in sight. It's fruit laden, focused and supple, with a feel that dazzles the senses and pure fruit flavors that just won't quit.
Crushed slate, plush rose petals, red cherry, smoked beef, vanilla and a slightly feral quality arise on the nose of this bottling from the region's most iconic vineyard. There is great tension on the sip, with tart plum skin, bright raspberry and dark cranberry fruit meeting with black spice, sandalwood and incense flavors. Acidity binds it all together.
Juicy red and black cherry, crushed raspberry, violet, white pepper, cinnamon and sage sensations all come together. Assertive tannins and exhilarating acidity balance out the intense fruit and spice flavors. It's still austere and tight but displays great breeding and serious aging potential. Drink after 2020.
A bold fruity wine, with sweet cherry and fresh fig flavors. It is ripe, full in the mouth, very fruity. An easy wine, with no pretensions, just great drinkability. Screwcap.
This is a new wine from Agustin Huneeus, of Quintessa. It's made largely from grapes off the Rutherford estate, and contains one-quarter Sémillon. Oak does not play a significant role, although the lees do. The wine itself is absolutely dry, crisp and minerally. It has palate-stimulating citrus flavors and is extraordinarily refined. Its only peer in Napa Valley is Mondavi's Tokalon Fumé Blanc.
From the heart of Oakville, this is a velvety thick wine, supple in tannin and integrated oak that offers a ying-yang of rich mocha notes and herbal sage.
Here's a vineyard-designate Barolo Riserva with pristine aromas of cherry, wild berry, smoke, tar, licorice and leather. The streamlined mouthfeel is polished yet firm, and the wine offers a long fade of cherry and spice flavors.
Red berry, rose and a sprinkling of baking spice aromas unfold in the glass while the firm, youthful palate offers tart red cherry, strawberry, star anise and white pepper. It's young but balanced, with bright acidity and assertive but refined tannins that leave a firm finish. Drink 2019–2024.
Perfumed with new wood aromas and violets, this is a full-bodied wine, its tannins blending into sweet plum and cranberry juice flavors. The wood is finely judged, giving a rounded feel to the finish, along with the acidity.
Dry, tannic and somewhat unripe, with herbal, vegetal aromas and flavors alongside the blackberries.
Blended with 11% Roussanne, this high-toned effort mixes Meyer lemon and grapefruit with broader fruit flavors of pear and peach. It's got alcohol listed at 14.6%—not unusual for Viognier, but it does bring on some heat in the finish.
This Cabernet couldn't be riper. Its blackberries and cherries are explosive, and veer into chocolate-covered raisins. Yet the wine is very dry and tannic. It's direct in its appeals now, but could easily develop bottle complexity over the next 6–8 years.
Crushed floral aromas, berry-infused tea and cherry candy aromas give this wine a sweet profile. The palate, however, is anything but. It pounds with toasty black fruit, licorice and fiery menthol. The feel is a bit tannic but not terribly harsh, so maybe another three to five years will serve it well.
Reminds me of the '97, a very ripe but very tannic wine that didn't offer much early on. The tannins on the '03 are bigtime astringent, locking down the palate, but oodles of ripely sweet cherry and cedar flavors tease. Best after 2008.
Very herbaceous in character, this is a wine that has richness, intensity and the balance of a mineral texture and tight acidity. It's a wine that needs food with its structure and tangy aftertaste.
This tiny hands-on artisanal producer has a particular gift for expressing the fruit of the Maresh vineyard, which was originally planted 45 years ago. This new release is elegant and aromatic, with precise details throughout. Fresh raspberries, light chocolate, a hint of nougat and persistent length are all part of the equation. Drink now through 2024.
Herbal and thin, this is not the fleshy, fruity style typical of Oregon Pinot Gris. Dilute flavors of apple and melon are smothered in herbs.
The vineyard is in the Carneros, and the grapes from this great vintage must have been just about perfect, to judge by the wine. It's beautiful, rich and delicious, yet so finely balanced. Explodes in blackberry jam, cocoa puff and leather flavors, dusted with black pepper and finished with a swirl of toasted cedar wood. Drink now.
Plush blackberry, fennel, mocha, char and peppercorn aromas show on the nose of this bottling from longtime friends Paul Quinn and James Schreiner. Dried plum skin, cherry and elderberry flavors show on the palate, which is layered with tannins and turns savory with charred beef, charcoal and tobacco flavors.
This is ripe and pure on the nose, with aromas of raisin, cherry and earth. The palate is full but not heavy, while flavors of cherry and blackberry run deep in front of a second wave of pepper and spice. Only on the finish does overt oak show up, so give this a few years and drink from 2016 through 2022.
Here's an oaky, ripe Chardonnay. It has pleasant pineapple, peach and lemon flavors and crisp acidity, and while it's not especially complex, it's a nice Chard for drinking now.
Rich, rounded, smooth, with cocoa and espresso flavors giving a touch of bitterness. It is a wine with power that is still young. Impressive, with its broad black fruits. Keep for 4–5 years.
Thanks to long oak aging, this is extra spicy and zesty on the finish. Its thick, supple mouthful would pair well with chocolate- or almond-based desserts.
Minerally blackberry aromas announce a tannic, firm palate. Flavors of dark, herbal berry fruits are earthy and stony, while a peppery, lightly herbal finish is solid and structured. This value-priced Monastrell-Syrah blend is fresh and well made.
Even Cabernet Sauvignon, that defiantly international variety, takes on a Portuguese character. This has that dark chocolate, high acidity and dry, but juicy character that marks so many Portuguese reds. It also has a more unfortunate volatility that is just too prominent.
This is a new wine from this negociant house that specializes in limited production wines. It is a smooth and rounded wine, ripe with apples and yellow fruits as well as being cut with acidity. The wine is refreshing and crisp at the end with a touch of minerality.
Lots of clove and oak on the nose, with some green aromas and coffee bean. Core black cherry with spice shadings carries the palate, while the finish is constricted and mildly tannic. Fairly hard in terms of mouthfeel. Imported by Oenophilia Imports.
This is rich and rounded, with ripe apple and peach flavors. It has a good depth of flavor that comes from the complex play between toast and sweet fruit notes. It has weight, and it can age over the next two years.
This wine is a unique blend of Syrah, Merlot, Viognier, Cabernet Sauvignon and Mourvèdre. It seems locked up, with aromas of pickling spices, smoke, berry and vanilla that are followed by broad blue and black-fruit flavors that provide appeal.
Quite creamy and sweet on the nose, with marshmallow and candy aromas that are not that convincing. Solid in the mouth, with herbal fruit, chocolate and plump tannins, body and extract. Better in terms of mouthfeel and concentration than flavor. Malbec, with Cabernet, Syrah and Petit Verdot.
Soft and easy, this is a simple wine, with pleasant berry, mocha and spice flavors. Still, the fruit and oak will likely win many fans.
So intense and concentrated, this wine epitomizes the essence of Riesling. Steely, tight, very nervy and bone dry, it is packed with flavors of citrus, orange zest, grapefruit and green apple skins. The texture of this young wine is beautifully crisp. Drink from 2016.
Smooth smelling, with pure and fresh berry and plum aromas. Very young and a bit tangy on the palate, with cherry and berry flavors and an oaky, soft finish that goes sweet then sour, and lasts for a long time. In terms of structure, it's balanced, mildly tannic, yet meant for drinking now.
This is a big burly wine that just has too many off aromas. Heavy barnyard scents mix with tart berry and espresso elements, and although there's body here, and what seem to be basically good elements, the stable-like odors stop the show.
True to its full-bodied, burly profile, this blend of 89% Syrah and 11% Petite Sirah packs a powerful punch and needs further time to open. For now, a reduced sense of baked coconut, plum and black pepper struggle for identity, with shocks of dark chocolate and velvet. Drink now through 2020.
Excellent concentration and depth elevate this young, tight Chardonnay. Flavors of lemon custard and caramel-coated apples abound, making it downright irresistible. 30% was aged in French oak, the rest in stainless.
This is a soft, ripe and fruity wine. It has gentle tannins and attractive red-berry fruits. There is just a touch of dryness that gives this easygoing wine its structure. Drink from early 2017.
Big and fruity, this has a juicy blackberry flavor that's leavened with a herbal tang. It is warm and rounded—the fruit right up front. Given this soft texture, the wine will age quickly and is ready to drink.
Earth, leather and tarry berry aromas yield to a fresh, forceful palate with power and balance. Spicy plum and berry flavors are a touch herbal and pointed, while a peppery, woody, spicy finish is leathery, hot and scratchy. Drink through 2018.
A classic pasta wine (probably best with fettuccine in meat sauce), this Chianti Classico offers bright acidity and a bouquet redolent of wild berries, cherries, leather and subtle spices.
Hints of spice and vanilla waft warmly amidst ripe blackberry and cherry notes on this deeply concentrated wine. Tart cranberry acidity and a spray of violet florals add flair to the palate. It finishes moderately long with a layer of velvety fine tannins.
Sweet and direct, this has blackberry, cherry jam, mocha and spicy sandalwood flavors. There's plenty of charm, but not much complexity. Drink now.
Here's a home run from one of the best producers in Montalcino. With sun drenched, sea-facing vineyards (this is one of the only spots where you can see the shimmering Mediterranean from Montalcino), this dense riserva doles out lingering flavors of spice, cherry, leather and tobacco. The acidity is perfectly balanced against the wine's soft fruit.
Well-oaked, with sweetly ripe, smooth tannins, this wine features a smooth texture and polished flavors of blackcurrants. It's a trifle soft in acidity, and probably not a cellar candidate.
Aromas of underbrush, baked earth, espresso and dried berry lead the nose along with a whiff of blue flowers. The straightforward palate offers mature black cherry, licorice and a hint of clove alongside fresh acidity.
Softly scented notes of ripe, yellow pears play on the nose. On the palate they become lusciously mouth-filling with their unobtrusive, friendly softness. There is a backbone of freshness and wonderful depth of lemon, with pear-scented concentration.
Impressively dark and showing the meaty andpeppery character of the grape, this Willamette Valley Syrah makes a good ¬argument for the viability of the grape up north. It emphasizes the flavors that are lost in a hotter climate—pepper, herb, tart berry, and juicy acidity. With alcohol at 12.3%, this sets a new standard for domestic, Euro-style Syrah.
It's an extraordinary wine that still tastes so fresh after 13 years, but for a Muscadet it's almost unbelievable. Yet, here is this citrus and white currant flavored wine that still shows high acidity and liveliness as well as a depth of texture that has come during its aging. Probably at its peak now.
Dry and punchy in cherry-berry and spice flavors, with rich acids and spices that will cut perfectly through mayo, mustard, relish, ketchup and fatty meats and cheeses. A perfect barbecue wine.
This Pinot has a cutting edge of citrusy acidity. On the plus side, it's also silky, with pleasant cherry candy, cola and oak flavors.
Honeysuckle richness and lemon freshness vie for attention on the nose. The palate comes in with lots of concentration and very pithy, almost bitter texture as well as residual sweetness. Together they create balance and a very intense tangy finish and leave a lasting impression.
Lots of toasty oak on this Pinot, but also plenty of rich, unctuous fruit to support it. Shows ample flavors of cloves, cinnamon, ripe wild cherries, and earthy, forest floor notes of balsam and dried pine needles. The texture is lightly delicate and silky, with crisp acidity. Really shows off the Clos Pepe terroir in a delightful way.
This is a softly appealing single-vineyard wine to drink now. It shows fine Napa Valley structure, with gentle tannins and cleansing acidity framing cherry, sandalwood and sweet tobacco flavors. With such elegance, it will be a fine partner to steak.
Forest floor, ripe berry and cake spice aromas emerge in the glass. The structured palate doles out dried black cherry, blackberry, licorice, ground pepper and tobacco alongside assertive tannins that need time to unwind. Drink 2017–2021.
95–97. Barrel sample. Full and powerfully concentrated, this wine has dense acidity, sweet black fruits and very fine tannins. The concentration is enormous but it expresses itself through the prism of smooth, velvet-textured tannins.
Golden colored, this is a clean, hedonistic wine, with a nose of rich coconut flake followed by caramel and baked apple. Enjoy with winter fare or as a gloomy day turns to night.
A good, rich Chardonnay, showing fine acidity and plenty of ripe pineapple, Asian pear, lime and green apple flavors, with a rich coating of sweet, caramelized oak.
Notes of yellow mirabelle plum compote make for a fruit-laden opening. The purity of that ripe, soft mirabelle fruit pervades the entire palate and also providesthe natural, enlivening freshness that illuminates a more citric edge. This is full of joyous fruit and just off-dry.
Rich and ripe in berry jam and spice flavors, this Pinot is enjoyable now for its silky texture and bright acidity. At the same time, it should develop bottle notes over the next six years.
From the get-go it's a big, full grapefruit-driven wine that's laced with smoke and vanilla. Citrus, mostly lemon, is the taste profile, while good lively acids power the tight, lemony finish. Serve chilled alongside a platter of tasty appetizers.
Mature, classy and different than most, with earth, tobacco, warm fruit, baked notes and subtlety to the bouquet. The palate is whole, welcoming and full of baked plum, spice, molasses and leathery, and then it finish long and complex, but a little sweet and rooty. A winner from Mallorca for those seeking something different. Drink now.
Part of the Jess Jackson empire of wineries, Hartford has a stellar record over the years across everything it produces, and this Chardonnay doesn't disappoint. It's bone dry and high in acidity, with a stony minerality that frames controlled peach, pear and mango fruit. The wine has that hard-to-define quality of elegant class.
The wine has a fine smoky character lying over the blackberry fruits. It has the potential to be rich with generous fruits and balanced tannins. The aftertaste is juicy and crisp.
This is a layered, earthy selection, with upfront aromas of leather and cigar box complemented by fruity tones of blackberry and cassis. The medium-weight palate is lush and velvety, and the tannins are fine yet firmly structured. Boysenberry preserves and black pepper linger on the finish.
This Chardonnay has all the highlights of Central Coast white wines. It's dry, acidic, pure and clean in varietal character, which in this case means pineapples, golden mangoes and white peaches. There's something so vanilla rich, you'd swear there was new oak, but there isn't. This is an entirely unwooded wine.
This delivers top quality at an attractive price point, with floral aromas of jasmine, honeysuckle and orange blossom. The finish is soft, feminine and very smooth.
Good everyday drinking at a decent price. Dry and fairly tannic, with grippy blackberry, cherry and sage flavors, and balancing acidity.
Flavors of melon, apricot and spice are the hallmarks of this single-vineyard wine. It has rounded, ripe fruit, given freshness by a pink grapefruit piquancy, and finishes with classic Grüner Veltliner pepper.
It has the light, silky texture of Pinot Noir, with powerful cherry jam and red currant flavors, enhanced with smoky oak. A barbecued steak will be the perfect partner, but so will a hamburger, the rarer the better.
The wine is impressive and packed with dense dark fruits. It comes from the showpiece estate of Madiran that was created by the iconic producer of the region, Alain Brumont. If this wine wasn't quite so intense, so overpowering and so alcoholic, it would be very great indeed. As it is, it will surely age and should not be drunk until 2020.
Well roasted and toasty, with plenty of barrel power and underlying black berry fruit. The palate is tight and fully tannic, while the palate has plum and sweet berry flavors. Ripe, a little grating and uncomplicated.
Fresh and clean, with very tart and herbal flavors, and lighter suggestions of pear and lime fruit. The zippy acidity defines the wine; it's clean and bracing.
Very ripe, very fruity and practically oozing across the palate, this full-bodied and very fairly priced wine tastes sweet and lightly tangy. The berry and plum flavors are quite concentrated, keeping the wine focused on fruit and freshness.
Rich and fruity, this structured wine, still young, is firm and dense. Juicy black fruits are layered with acidity and given a solid character by the concentrated tannin core. Drink from 2017.
Delicate and crisp, this is a well-balanced fruity wine with strawberry flavor. The finish is warm and soft, with a tang of lemon.
With a hint of minerality, this wine has structure to go with its soft, generous fruit. There are almonds, toast, peaches and an attractive rounded texture.
Subdued aromas of French oak, toast, tropical fruit and a whiff of dried herb carry follow over to the palate along with nuances of mature apple and citrus zest. A note of bitter almond closes the rather lean finish.
Earthy and lightly baked on the bouquet, with raspberry and plum aromas along with grassy notes and spice. The palate is medium in size and juicy, with fresh, lightly oaked berry and herbal plum flavors. Not heavy or overbearing.
This huge Malbec defines jammy and concentrated. The bouquet is ripe, soft and minty, while the palate echoes the nose with thickness and density. Flavors of prune, raisin, tea and blackberry are borderline syrupy, while the finish is smooth and pure but doesn't offer much spine or foundation. Drink this modern Malbec sooner rather than later.
The name pays homage to the Graves region of Bordeaux, and the blend of 54% Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Merlot and 6% Cabernet Franc also mimics those wines. Here the grapes are sourced from the Red Willow (Yakima Valley), Bacchus (Columbia Basin) and Klipsun (Red Mountain) vineyards. Supple, with beautifully integrated red fruits, and tannins as soft as a kiss, it's masterful winemaking from Chris Peterson, who tended the wines of DeLille for many years.
This is a full-bodied, creamy and voluptuous Chardonnay, bearing notes of wet stone and ripe yellow apple, with a tinge of vanilla on the finish.
Opens with aromas of black soil, mint and cola. Its acids are lively, its cherry fruit tight, and an undercurrent of eucalyptus ties it all together—all characters that you either love or you don't. The wine has a lot going for it, though, and is worth a look. Imported by Southland Wines.
A classic Bordeaux blend (about 30% each Cab Sauvignon, Cab Franc and Merlot, the rest Petite Verdot) This wine is still locked up tight upon release. There is metallic minerality underpinning the tart, austere fruit, but there are also surprising high notes of brandied cherries, and a sense of depth missing in more ordinary wines. This is definitely a wine to cellar for up to a decade. As always, this is sensitive, detailed winemaking.
Fresh, cool, crisp and packed tight with aromas of citrus, exotic fruit and fragrant flowers, this is a wonderful Sauvignon from northeast Italy. Pair it with leek quiche or lightly fried zucchini flowers to maximize the wine's natural acidity.
Pristine peach and grapefruit flavors contrast with slightly stinky but captivating soil and saffron complexities in this sprightly auslese. Its honey-kissed sweetness pierces through a long, lemony finish. It's delicious already but should continue to improve through 2030, likely beyond.
Here's a gutsy, fruity Cabernet. It fills the mouth with juicy raspberry, cherry and blackberry flavors and hints of chocolate. Nothing subtle, just a dry, rich red wine for drinking now.
This light Vermentino opens with a pale straw color, and it has lively aromas of citrus, kiwi, cut grass and mineral. A dose of refreshing acidity marks the finish.
With a very pretty nose of perfumed pear, green apple and lime, this unoaked Chardonnay is nicely soft and easy to drink. Made from organic Chardonnay and a touch of Viognier, this smells and tastes of summer. Even without a hint of oak this retains plenty of richness and a fresh vibrancy on the finish.
Shows tremendeous richness and impressive weight along the lines of a Chardonnay, although the flavors are lighter and more refined, suggesting tangerines and Meyer lemons. Brisk coastal acidity provides brilliantly bright balance. Very fine as a more food-friendly alternative to many Chardonnays.
The notes of herbs and citrus are quite light. It's medium bodied and drinks just a hair off dry, thinning out toward the finish.
From winemaker John Davey, a wine with jammy berries on the nose and a pleasing, round mouthfeel. Once you get through the juicy, ripe black berries on the palate, there's a tightly wound, bright red-cherry core that gives you hope that a couple of years in the cellar will do it more good than harm. Meaty on the back palate; finishes with chewy tannins.
This Rhone winery's inaugural Bordeaux variety offering is a blend of 57% Cabernet and 43% Merlot. The aromas of dried and fresh herbs and barrel spice show nuance, leaning slightly into the green. The cherry and dark-fruit flavors display an exquisite sense of polish, detail and length that kicks it up a notch.
This ripe, easygoing red offers fruity yet fleeting aromas and flavors of fleshy black cherry and baked plum. It's made to be drunk young so enjoy now.
Aromas of leather, dried cherry, vanilla and leafy earthiness get this gran reserva moving. In the mouth, it's a touch choppy and wiry, with leafy, roasted flavors of savory plum and spice. This is shy on the finish, with a hint of spice and chocolate. Drink now.
Like a fairway-splitting drive in golf, this wine is just what the masses want: It's full of grapefruit, passion fruit, gooseberry and citrus rind. The acidity, however, is pounding, so the finish might sweat your tongue a bit, thereby yielding a juicy mouthfeel. Overall, it starts well and then fades a bit.
A whiff of vanilla mingles amidst fresh watermelon, berry and cherry in this bright fruity rosé. It's dry in style with lush voluminous body. A hint of phenolic bitterness juxtaposes a slightly candied finish.
In terms of aged vintage tawnies, this beautiful wine is relatively young. That means the fruit is still there, hinting at bold red fruits as well as the dried fig and sultana flavors that have also emerged. The wine is finely balanced with its rich texture and poise coming in between dry and sweet. Drink now.
Simple and agreeable, this can be paired with a burger or beef taco. It's dry and clean, with pleasant cherry and cola flavors.
Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot from the Sanmichele vineyard of the Serramarrocco estate are blended to produce a thick, inky Sicilian red that is redolent of blackberry, dried prune, rum cake and exotic clove or cardamom. Pair this richly textured red with stewed beef or game meat.
Juicy, ripe peach and blossom notes perfume this full bodied blend of Chardonnay, Riesling and Pinot Blanc. It's moderately concentrated, with delicate flavors of fresh stone fruit, pear and toast, but enlivened by a streak of sunny lemon acidity. Finishes briskly.
Concentrated and sweet, with aromas of raisin and cassis that lead onto an intense, syrupy palate, with salty berry, brown sugar and fudge flavors. This is deep as a country well, with a ton of flavor. But truth be told, it's tannic as can be, with a crushing mouthfeel that makes food mandatory.
Struck flint and tomato stalk on the nose lead into a medium-bodied wine with strong citrus overtones. White grapefruit and green leafy notes linger on the dry finish.
There are big problems with this Cabernet. It's fruity and jammy-sweet, and also shows some fizziness, indicating instability. Tasted twice, with consistent results.
Despite the statewide appellation, this Chard tastes like it has a lot of cool-climate, coastal fruit in it. It's dry and crisply acidic, with bright flavors of limes, tangerines and pineapples.
With its palest of red colors, this is real cool-climate Pinot Noir. The palate is lean, just hinting at some strawberry flavors, but with high acid and tight, smoky tannins.
Fresh apple, lemon and pear flavors are accented by a hint of smoked nuts in this bold, full-bodied Pinot Gris. Rich and a bit creamy in mouthfeel yet balanced briskly, it's a satisfying white with wide pairing appeal. Drink now through 2019.
Ripe stone-fruit and flower notes shine on the nose and palate of this dry, medium-bodied Chardonnay. Fresh and juicy, it's an easygoing sipper to accompany an array of foods.
A block-designated wine, this shows both purpose and focus, offering a linear expression of stony minerality, crisp lemon and peach. To complement that vibrant freshness, there is a fullness of mouthfeel and a nuanced gravelly texture.
Quite young, this wine is still showing some reduced flavors, so give it plenty of breathing time. Clean and varietal black fruit and generous amounts of chocolaty oak provide the foundation. More time is needed to pull all the components together into a seamless whole.
Unripe and green, with acidic gooseberry, menthol and green peppercorn aromas and flavors.
It's easy to see Rothschild's Bordeaux influence in this one—it's more about chalky, minerally tannins than oak, and offers mixed berries on both palate and nose. An acorn nuttiness and some dried spices linger throughout. A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Carmenère. Best Buy.
There's an initial intense citrus character to this wine, a product of its youth. But then the freshness is enriched by the pear and green apple flavors, lifted by lively acidity. There are some almond and peach flavors to give an exotic touch to this superb wine that could age for a decade or more.
With only 795 bottles produced, this is a special treat. Although it's ready to drink now, it has the structure and pedigree to age for decades. Loaded with rich nut and rancio flavors, there's so much going on; aromas of dried orange peel, gingerbread, toasted macadamia nut and a drizzle of molasses lead into flavors of dried red plum and fig dusted with Nutella powder and soft white pepper. Complex, spicy and full, with an endless finish.
This fragrant selection shows violet and plum aromas, with a hint of spice and herbs. The palate delivers ripe plum, bitter cherry, spice and coffee sensations. The palate is still young and tightly tannic, but fresh. Pair this with pasta dishes and young cheeses.
Vernaccia strives to demonstrate its aging ability in this slightly oxidized, oak-fermented white that is redolent of stone fruit, mature melon, almond and pine sap. It's an interesting wine with depth, dimension and loads of personality (albeit a style that not everyone will appreciate).
Hints of savory earth mingle with fresh apple notes. The palate has the bright mellow freshness of ripe oranges and the juiciness of ripe pear. A core of bright lemon acidity makes for a clean, bright and refreshing finish.
A bit too rubbery and gassy to qualify as “clean,” with leafiness running the bouquet. The palate is sort of flat, with raisin, baked cherry and prune flavors. It's on the borderline of being stewed.
There's no denying the wine's core strengths, which start with the bouquet's campfire and prune qualities and extend onto the palate, where peppy raspberry and plum flavors take over. This is a complete, stylish Rioja that's about halfway through the aging process. It's still juicy and agile, with licorice and raisin notes adding some sweetness. Drink now–2016.
This is a refreshing picnic wine with light acidity, touches of pears and some sweetness. Its low alcohol makes it great for summer sunshine.
This offers reserved notes of cherry and raspberry compote, cranberry, earth and assorted dried herbs. With the oak pleasantly dialed back, the focus remains on the fruit. The palate displays exquisite purity, elegance and detail, with a light grip of tannins pulling it all together. It's drinking beautifully now, but you could open it up in 2025 or 2030 and it wouldn't bat an eye.
The wine is ripe, soft and spicy. It has a rustic feel, disclosing earthy aromas and almond and spice flavors. Light acidity keeps the wine fresh, although already it is showing signs of maturity. Drink now.
Caramelized blueberry and a sweet cedar woody aroma makes for a very inviting nose on this bottling from regional pioneer Gary Eberle. The palate is full of flavor, with blackberry syrup, balsamic fig vinaigrette and cola spice. A judicious acidity holds it all together.
From the Vieira family's Lisboa vineyard, this blend of Touriga Nacional, Tinta Roriz and Syrah is well balanced, offering elegant black fruits and delicious acidity. The structure is restrained and finely wrought. Drink the wine now.
In its flight, this medium-bodied wine was relatively restrained. While it delivers honeyed tropical and citrus fruits on the nose, the flavors are of melon and citrus, which fade quickly on the finish.
Impenetrably dark in color, this potent wine marries black fruit to ample barrel accents of smoke and char. Though aged in just 5% new French oak, those dark scents and flavors permeate the wine. It's a style with broad appeal.
Very spicy, with an intense bouquet of toast, seed and pungent herb. Rich and fruity in the mouth, it's a complex mix of melon, passion fruit, papaya, guava and sweet orange. The fruit salad rolls back into oaky, buttery flavors for a full-throttle finish. Another 15.5% effort from Airfield, but here the fruit can stand up to the barrels.
A rather soapy, wine, it does not have enough fruitiness to sustain its tannins. It's hard edged and likely to remain that way.
This light-colored Cortese is an easy-going white that manages to be both very light and quite complex. The aromas of roasted peaches and apricots is lovely but low in intensity. The same can be said for the palate; complex and a touch dilute. The finish on this surprising, it has a real persistence to it.
A tightly tannic wine, with a firm feeling of wood, balanced by stalky black currant fruit and a layer of acidity. It is still young, with the tannins likely to soften.
Notes of raw cherry, coffee syrup, ripe blackberry and moist pipe tobacco all play major roles on the bouquet. This is boldly extracted and rich, with toasted espresso and almond notes on the finish.
The Zin is cut with 15% Syrah, a nice choice. Smooth and plummy and loaded with spice cake flavors, it's a moderate 13.5% alcohol—light for Zin—but has plenty of oomph in the mouth, ripe fruit and a pleasing chocolaty finish. Great presence and polish  elevate this well above the ordinary.
This is an outstanding value in a Willamette Valley Pinot Noir—soft, subtle and spicy, with sweet strawberry and cherry fruit. All neutral oak fermented, the mouthfeel is smooth and supple, and the flavors have a sexy, delicious quality that says “drink me now!”
A tasty mix of fresh fruit flavors—including melon, peach and nectarine—this is sourced in part from Snipes Mountain's excellent Upland Vineyard. Aged in 100% stainless steel, it's balanced and tight, with good snap to the finish.
This is a stunner because it shows such minerally depth, which many strive for but few achieve on a pink wine. The classic shade of pink gives way to bubblegum, lime juice, orange rind and smashed raspberry aromas. The zesty, vibrant lime juice acidity cuts right through plum fruit, but it's the graphite and chalky tension that wins the palate.
Strong in oaky flavors, with sweet, sugary caramel dominating everything underneath. The basic wine seems pretty good, showing pineapples and acidity.
Amazingly rich, one of the most opulent Chardonnays you can drink now. Just wows the mouth with pineapple, pear, exotic tropical fruit, crème brûlée, vanilla custard, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors that go on and on through the finish. Also shows fine, tart acidity, which provides needed balance. Yes, it's superripe, but this is what California Chardonnay does at its best.
Solid but generic berry fruit aromas are clean and come with herbal, minty edging. There's no shortage of acidity, so the palate has a sharp, crisp feel and tart, oaky flavors of berry and plum. Sheer, hard, tart and dry on the finish.
Soft and open, this wine has the generosity and drinkability of a good village Meursault. There are flavors of quince,  spice, a touch of citrus and some vanilla.
Rich, verging on heavy, this barrel-fermented Gewürztraminer may be just too much of a good thing. Honeyed peach and modest spice flavors are palate-coating, then fade abruptly on the finish.
With lots of spices and maple syrup notes, this smells and tastes rich, nearly sweet, smooth in texture and medium in body. It should be good with barbecue, because the perceived sweetness can soften spicy, peppery food.
This wine begins well, with bright, focused aromas of cassis, cracker and mocha. In the mouth it feels somewhat dilute and chalky, with light raspberry fruit, lemony acidity and chewy tannins. An herbal character comes forward as well.
This big, bold, structured offering is full of ripe blackberry flavor and integrated tannins. It is intensely rich and already delicious. Bomfim is the main winery for the Dow Port brand.
An appealing Pinot for its fresh, silky mouthfeel and delicious flavors. Rich in raspberry-cherry pie filling and cola, with a funky edge of bacon, it's finished with smoky oak. A rather sweet wine to drink now.
Spicy plum and black currant aromas lead this stylish red blend. On the palate, savory black fruit and pepper flavors are poised and elegant, and not too big. Structured tannins and a spicy finish give it muscle, but overall it's a mannered wine with a touch of mischief at the end.
From a 2,400-foot elevation vineyard, this wine is unexpectedly elegant and definitively age-worthy. Floral and unusual, the palate brings integrated tannins wrapped around a core of ripe blackberry and cassis. Structured, it has plenty of body and length, bringing an old world sensibility to new world fruit. Drink now through 2022.
Translated, the name of this vineyard means fogs, maybe a reference to a predisposition to get misty in the morning. Adjacent to Pommard, the wine has some of the structure of that village allied to the rounder character of Volnay. Together, these elements make for a wine that is likely to age well. Drink this ripe and smoky wine from 2023.
A blend of Grenache (45%), Shiraz (25%), Cabernet Sauvignon (22%) and Dolcetto (8%), this quaffer shows bright raspberry and plum flavors on the palate, with just a hint of sweetness. Floral and raspberry aromas are bright and inviting on the nose. Finishes like a Cabernet, quite dry, with chalky tannins. A hit with spicy food, or as a summertime sipper.
High-toned herb aromas mix with barrel spice, pencil lead and blackberry notes on this initially aromatically brooding wine. The palate holds nothing back with rich, intense black-fruit flavors that display a ripe style. It's a bit hard to get at the variety but the yum factor is there.
This is dry and very crisp, with a taut, nervy texture. It has a tight, tangy character, with a youthful feel. A great food-friendly wine, this should age for several years.
Round and fruity, open and broad, this is a perfectly sound sipping white, without any particular focus or varietal specificity.
Corte San Benedetto is a small, family run winery and its 2003 Amarone shows ripe notes of black cherry, mesquite, blackberry and soft vanilla. The oak element is evident here; the wine is soft and supple on the close.
The foxy muddled berry aromas are puzzling. This Malbec blend feels narrow and pinched. Hollow lactic foxy red-fruit flavors are crisp but not fully convincing, while abrasive, hard-edged tannins scrape across the finish.
A quirky, crazy mix of black plum, acorns, fresh-cut grass and a little pickle-barrel on the nose, but it settles down into something quite nice on the palate. Tannins are soft; no-nonsense plum fruit has undertones of brown-red clay. Finishes with a burst of mocha, coffee and eucalyptus.
Despite a silky, medium-bodied texture, this Pinot is tough and tannic, with a sandpapery astringency through the finish. It's deep in flavor, with waves of cherry, cola, rhubarb, pomegranate, balsam, mushroom and sandalwood, and is elegantly structured and thoroughly dry. Needs time. Better after 2011.
The aromas here suggest something artificial, either candle wax or air freshener combined with red fruits. The palate has a narrow feel with ample acidity and a light body for Ribera del Duero. Flavors run in the direction of stewed plum, while the finish feels rough and tastes a bit raisiny.
Lightly vegetal aromas of asparagus and canned beans are intermixed with generic citrus scents. This wine is more acid than anything, with angularity to the palate. Salty, tart, citric flavors finish racy and with a lingering note of sour orange.
Stalky, leathery aromas are low on fruit and freshness. This has a grabby feel, sort of like leather straps. Herbal berry and plum flavors are mildly bitter, while a green note is apparent on the finish. 90+? Not exactly.
Green and focused on the nose, with a hint of fresh bell pepper. The palate is light and chiseled, with crisp flavors of white grapefruit, lime and passion fruit. Finishes elegant and fresh. An ideal quaffer to go with salads and shellfish.
A bit raw and minty, but not a bad everyday Cab for this price. It's dry and clean, with modest cherry-berry flavors.
From iron-rich soils, this expression of Barolo offers elegant mineral tones and slate backed by plump aromas of blackberry, currant, cola, leather, spice and smoked cedar wood. There's also an attractive floral note at the back. The wine offers notably fine textured tannins, with a smooth and polished feel.
This is sensuous Chardonnay that provides plenty of texture and depth without being heavy. The bouquet is robust and complex, with pear, smoke, vanilla, cumin and an appealing oatmeal-graham cracker-like note. A full spectrum of similarly ripe fruit flavors coats the mouth, bolstered by good acidity, and you can almost sink your teeth into the full, chewy mouthfeel. This very impressive bottling finishes long and complex, with grainy pear, spice and buttery notes. Editors' Choice.
Winemaker: Teddy Hall. This is a rich and opulent Cab, with upfront aromas of vanilla, sweet oak spice, cherry preserves and raspberry compote that seduce you into the glass. You'd expect the palate to be slick and heavy, and it is quite soft in ripe fruit flavors, but it's just structured enough, thanks to velvety tannins and lingering spice on the medium-length finish. Given the judicious oak and plush flavors and feel, enjoy this over the short term.
This simple but inviting wine is made from a blend of 60% Sangiovese and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon. The bright palate boasts sour cherry, red currants and light note of white pepper alongside fresh acidity. It's perfect for everyday fare.
Aromas of pencil lead and lemony oak vie with jammy, raisiny scents. This is a live-wire wine with energy flowing across a jumpy palate. Ripe cassis and blackberry flavors show a licorice note, while the finish is concentrated at first before breaking up and showing some heat. Drink through 2018.
With only 56 cases imported, this may be one of the hardest Saint Clair wines to find, but it offers a refreshingly austere alternative to some of the winery's other bottlings. It's only medium bodied, with delicate, leafy aromas and pristine white-grapefruit flavors. Convincingly dry and bracing on the finish, it would make a brisk counterpoint to rich fish dishes.
The pioneering winery's basic Syrah, this is impressively complex and delicious, with aromas of coffee, blueberry, purple flowers, graphite and the slightest touch of beef jerky. The olallieberry-laced palate is pleasantly quaffable and yet dynamic, with clove, leather, pipe tobacco and spearmint elements spicing up the layers of dark fruit.
This combines 65% Cabernet Sauvignon and 35% Zinfandel into a voluptuously lush and rounded package of blackberry fruit and tobacco leaf flavor. The texture is dusty and gravelly, complementing the jammy ripeness.
This wine boasts a very nice balance of enticing aromas such as cola, mint tea, basil leaf, chocolate and dried tobacco. Yet there was enough fruit and berry flavors to ensure a long cellar life. Plump and velvety in the mouth, with mouth cleansing freshness on the finish. A Marc de Grazia selection, various U.S. importers.
Deep ruby to the eye, this wine has a bouquet of black plum and cherry with a touch of iodine. A network of gentle tannins provides the backdrop for flavors of black cherry, blueberry, cranberry, smoked meat, vanilla and lavender. There is a hint of smoke on the otherwise fruit-filled finish.
Lactic, creamy oak brings overt aromas of vanilla, shoe polish and graphite along with Ribera del Duero's requisite black-fruit scents. This is jammy and heavy on the palate, with hard tannins. Flavors of blackened, spicy berry fruits, espresso, bitter chocolate and stewed blackberry finish gritty and with flavors of prune, licorice and mocha. Best from 2015 through 2021.
This opens with aromas of mature dark fruit, toast and a slight whiff of cellar floor. The palate is still tight and rather closed, but offers fleshy black cherry, toasted oak, clove and mocha alongside polished tannins. It's fast approaching its ideal drinking window so enjoy sooner rather than later.
Have some warm country Zin. It's black in color, with high alcohol, soft acids and Porty flavors of blackberry essence, sweetened espresso and chocolate truffle.
Rustic, earthy aromas lead to a wine that's dominated by dark tannins and bitter chocolate flavors. That leaves little room for the rich berry fruits that are struggling to come through. Allow time for this toughness and firm extraction to soften. Drink from 2016.
Sharp anise, violet and menthol scents swirl around a core of rich blackberry jam on this wine, hitting the palate with serious thickness. The Kamal, named after an 8th-century navigation device, also features the other four Bordeaux varietals. It delivers flavors of deep plum jelly, cherry syrup, pepper and cedar.
Juicy brick tar and a sumptuous offering of blueberry and blackberry pie characterize this medium-bodied, softly approachable and easygoing red. Hints of smoky oak and dried herb lurk in the background.
Starts with ripe apple and white peach scents that gravitate toward green apple and vanilla flavors on the palate. Medium- to full-bodied, with a mildly spicy-peppery finish. Imported by Classical Wines.
This is a light and tonic Prosecco Superiore that offers aromas of hay and dried grass backed by peach and citrus. Pair this wine with lightly fried vegetable tempura.
This is a modestly priced Napa Cabernet that's feral and brambly, the flavors well-composed and soft in black plum and black cherry. It's well balanced and structured, with ample tannins and length on the finish.
Here's a Chard that combines elegance and sophistication with great depth of flavor. It shows its terroir in the soft texture and well-ripened tropical fruit and peach flavors. There's a pretty coating of oak leading to a long, fruity-spicy finish.
A wine that gives us the heady, pure freshness of crushed, wild blackberries. Unadulterated, primary fruit is the main appeal of this refreshing wine. Drink this young and enjoy its lively burst of lingering berry flavor.
Should have been held back a year before release, because at the age of just a little more than one year it's a big, heavy, jammy wine marked by primary fruit flavors and unintegrated oak. The particular fruits are blackberries, cherries and chocolate. Age it on your own through 2010 and preferably 2011.
Sugary sweet and medicinal, like cherry cough syrup.
A blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay, this richly honeyed, still very young wine has all the weight and richness of sweet wines from the southern end of Lake Neusiedl. It is packed with ripe yellow fruits, layered with intense honey and has just an edge of dryness from the noble rot. It's worth aging over 4–6 years.
This wine is a bit reductive out of the gate, opening to reveal aromas of pear, peach, melon, lees and spice. The palate is creamy and textured in feel. If the aromas come together, it could move up a notch.
The appealing nose of lemony-lime aromas features a hint of honey. This medium-sweet wine with a gripping crispness is fairly light-bodied and slightly loose-knit, but refreshing, with moderately intense flavors of citrus cocktail. A nice earthy kick chimes in on the finish.
The Fog Crest bottling is a blend of various vineyards. It's a dependable wine that can approach the Estate bottling in richness—although it never quite gets there. The 2010 is ripe, bearing raspberry and cherry flavors. Drink now.
Dusty apple and vanilla scents weigh in on the heavy/yeasty side. This feels cidery and a bit flat. Flavors of briny citrus don't offer much diversity or complexity, while this fades away with a simple note of orange and not much else.
This light and lemony wine would make a good afternoon sipper, or a tasty match for grilled fish. The spicy, citrus fruit shows good intensity midpalate. Finishes clean, with moderate length and herb notes.
Baking spice and smoky wood-grain aromas are classy but dominate fruit scents. This wine feels crisp and snappy, with hard tannins. Spicy, woody flavors match the nose and are backed by chocolate and berry fruit notes, carrying through to the spicy, oaky finish.
This bright passito dessert wine delivers a steady stream of apricot, honey, almond and candy-like aromas. The wine is thick, syrupy and ends with a fresh note of citrus zest.
A wondrously rich and extracted nose combines layers of brown spice, dried black cherries, fragrant violets and lilacs with concentrated, almost pruney purple fruit. That ripeness expertly pairs on the palate with strong tannic structure and sparkling acidity, allowing the blackberry, blueberry, caramel and lavender notes to shine without cloying.
Typical Garys' Pinot, a big, dry, high-alcohol wine ripe in cherry-berry fruit character, fairly hefty in tannins for a Pinot and crisp in coastal acidity. You wouldn't call this wine elegant, but it's admirable for its Santa Lucia-esque muscularity. Should benefit from three to five years' aging.
A shade off from the past few vintages, but still a nice Pinot Noir. Showing crisp acidity and some firm tannins, it's sweet and forward in black raspberry, cherry, cola and spice flavors. Drink over the next 2–3 years.
Dried black cherries, dried herbs, pencil shavings and touches of roasted meat and balsamic vinegar show on the nose of this bottling. The sip conveys smoked berries, dried strawberry, red plum and touches of oregano, marjoram and black pepper.
Soft and simple, this blend of Cab, Petite Verdot and Syrah has stewed fruit and chocolate flavors that finish with candied sweetness.
Despite the low alcohol, this is quite dry and tart, with a lemony base and some orange-pekoe flavors also. Not a complex Riesling, but light and pleasantly sippable.
This is every bit as good as the winery's Clave de Tábula, which costs twice as much. An aromatic opening of fig, prune and blackberry comes with graphite, cola and attractive oak notes. This is intense and shows powerful acidity in support of blackberry, toast and dark, spicy flavors. A medium-long finish with toast and licorice is proper and not overdone. Drink from 2014–2022.
Red currant, blackberry, espresso, wood shavings and cedar aromas unfold in the glass. The palate offers dried black cherry, anise, coffee, coconut and oak alongside alongside drying tannins that leave an astringent finish. The fruit is starting to dry up so drink sooner rather than later.
A good value in Sauvignon Blanc. It shows fine citrus and melon flavors that are dry and properly balanced with acidity. There's a tang of minerality that must come from Livermore's soil.
Melon and white-fruit aromas are more generic than specific. This has a lively, fresh mouthfeel, along with flavors of nectarine, melon and persimmon. A lasting finish has a racy feel but offers nothing more in terms of flavors or complexity.
Old-vine Kestrel Vineyard fruit delivers; this is excellent juice. Concentrated and lush, it's packed with pineapple, green apple, hints of pear and light tropical fruits. A fruit-driven, powerful wine, with cracker and oatmeal flavors showing up in the finish.
This overripe Cab tastes like the essences of currant, raisin and prune. It's bone dry and quite tannic. This unbalanced wine is not going anywhere, so drink up.
Comes at you with a positive mix of herbal aromas and red fruit. The palate is spicy and savory, with crisp but simple fruit flavors forming a nice foundation. Shows good weight and flow, as it ultimately registers as fresh.
Aromas of underbrush, blue flowers, dark berries and a whiff of menthol unfold in the glass. The supple palate offers fleshy wild cherry, black raspberry, licorice, mint and white pepper alongside firm but fine-grained tannins. Drink 2016–2021.
Pleasantly off-dry, with simple, fruity aromas and flavors reminiscent of apple and citrus. A solid choice for an outdoor gathering this summer.
Vanilla is the lead flavor on this generic, oaky Chardonnay. Creamy and a tad soft in the mouth, it has flavors of resiny oak that blend with pear, melon and vanilla on the palate. Popcorn notes come up on a woody finish.
Still very young, this ripe Merlot-dominated wine is packed with dark plum and rich damson fruit flavors. They balance the serious amount of wood influence that gives it its spice and ageability. Drink from 2023.
All five red Bordeaux varieties are represented here, the greater percentages being Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Malbec, in almost equal proportion. Barbecue smoke enters the picture first, with a substantial aroma and taste of char. It makes for a one-dimensional experience.
This is a blend of blocks from the large estate vineyard, yielding a very complete wine. It's brisk in acidity, dry and silky, with low alcohol and firm tannins framing raspberry and cherry skin, cola and pomegranate flavors.
A light, fresh style, bringing out grapefruit flavors, herbaceous and crisp. The wine is pure green fruits, bright and bursting with thirst-quenching acidity.
Espresso and baguette notes hit the nose first, followed by accents of mixed berries. Although the minerally and herbal flavors are pleasant, they lack the brio to make this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Petit Verdot a stand out. The malleable texture makes this wine suitable to be paired with a cheesy pizza.
Drinking quite nicely at the moment, this is a generous, dense wine with a full complement of dark fruits, cacao, smoke and hints of black tea. From the opening aromatics on through a seamless weave of fruit and barrel flavors, this is irresistibly delicious.
This late-release wine has distinctive, enticing aromas like cedar, mushrooms and cigar box. Along with mellow fruity, savory flavors, these contribute to a beautifully mature character. It is medium to full in body, very smooth in texture due to softened tannins, and lasting on the finish.
Stony lime and apple aromas are a proper set up to a balanced, racy palate. Flavors of dried apple, tropical fruits and pithy bitterness finish with white pepper notes and purity. This isn't complex but it will get the job done with Asian foods, salads and as an apéritif.
There's not a ton of intensity to the bouquet of this wine, but some serious sniffing can coax out suggestions of red apple and white florals. The mouth offers a bit more by way of full, juicy cantaloupe and grapefruit supreme flavors. Fresh and easy; drink now.
Intensely rich, this mint- and red- fruit-flavored wine is powered by its ripe fruit. The tannins give shape to the ripeness, and there's a line of acidity, concentrated as well as fresh.
Here's a ripe, slightly cooked Sangiovese from Puglia with a brownish color and full aromas of ripe raspberry and strawberry jam. It's chewy and slightly sour in the mouth with polished tannins. Drink now.
A heady opening of barrel reduction burns off in due time in this ultimately lovely wine that is intense in caramel apple and baked pear. Elegant on the palate, it has a big entry that settles into fresh, sophisticated layers of just-ripe fruit accented by a tart, tangy finish.
A little bit funky and unsettled when you pop the screwcap, but soon it finds its floral, blueberry base. Remains superficial and sweet in the mouth, with candied flavors, vanilla and mild oak. Highly regular; could use more concentration and density.
Campo Ceni is a New World expression of Sangiovese (that sees 6 months in oak) with deep layers of blackberry, spice, leather and tobacco. The mouthfeel is supple and smooth and this wine is an absolute pleasure to drink.
This fragrant red opens with blue flower, wild strawberry, red berry and a note of baking spice. The vibrant, linear palate delivers crushed cherry, red raspberry, white pepper, flinty mineral and thyme alongside polished tannins and bright acidity.
Norman Beko saves library wines for his fans to enjoy, and this bottling, which shows its age yet remains interesting, is one great example. Kirsch, leather, charred wood and cola aromas lead to a palate laced with hibiscus, cherry paste, hoisin and earthy spice. It is nearly past its prime, so drink up.
Hints of autumn leaf and bramble add rustic warmth to this delicate wine. Medium bodied, the palate is brisk with tart red cherry and berry flavors accented with soft tannins on the finish.
This 100% Syrah conveys espresso, raw meat, flowers, chocolate and peppery spices. It's reserved in style with tart acids.
Zesty aromas of tart pineapple and tangerine, slate and chalk contrast the luscious peach and red apple fruitiness of this off-dry Riesling. It's a refreshingly crisp and thirst-quenching wine for youthful consumption.
Soft, simple and a little vegetal, with modest blackberry and oak flavors. The tannins are well-sculpted.
Earthy aromas of fresh tarragon and burnt cedar make an intriguing start to this wine, whose soft opening on the palate veers quickly into heavy flavors of chopped oregano. A plum element emerges faintly on the midpalate, but this is a solid wine for herb lovers.
Aromas of bread crust, pastry cream and toast come together in the glass. The creamy palate offers mature pear, yellow apple and toasted hazelnut alongside a soft mousse.
Here's a straightforward Verdicchio with a pretty floral fragrance of white spring flowers. This is medium-bodied and shows pear and white peach flavors balanced by crisp acidity that leads to a clean finish. It's very well-priced.
Lychee, lemon-lime and bath soap aromas set up a foamy, rough, coarse palate. Flavors of soapy tropical fruits seem almost artificial, and so does the finish, which is sugary sweet.
Pungent and ripe, with aggressive citrus and stone-fruit aromas. Tastes a bit like a powder-based fruit drink, with grapefruit and gritty, acid-driven lemon characteristics. Quite zippy and tangy on the finish.
This is another fantastic vintage of this Zinfandel, blended smaller amounts of Mourvèdre and Petite Sirah. It offers a wealth of soft, juicy milk chocolate and cherry pie character and is high in acidity and dusty tannin. A beautiful, memorable testament to what this variety can be.
Strongly scented with orange peel and orange juice, the citrusy opening gives way to some light raspberry fruit. There's a bit of a hole in the middle; then in come the chalky tannins.
Freshly cut peel of yellow apples is the chief marker on nose and palate. The easy-drinking, crisp body has an edge of alcoholic heat but trumps with light, easy fruit.
Less jammy and forward than the '04 Elevage, but more closed and tannic than the winery's regular 2005 Cabernet, this Bordeaux blend really needs time to show its stuff. It has obviously deep and impressive currant and blackberry flavors, but the tannins are significant. Hold until at least 2010.
Though not labeled as such, this wine is all Gewürztraminer. It's aromatic with aromas of lychee, rose petal and spice. The flavors are light and dry, almost delicate, with abundant floral accents.
Subtle in approach, in keeping with the Dopff & Irion house style, this wine shows good minerality on the nose and moderate intensity in the mouth. Not overpowered by superripe flavors—the themes here are apple and pear. The dry, citrusy finish makes this a good pairing for a meaty fish such as swordfish or tuna.
Opens with classic lychee and melon aromas and only a touch of flower blossom. The palate has a nice, clean, healthy feel and flavors of green apple, lime and melon. Exceedingly clean and easygoing, with juicy acidity and proper balance.
The nose is defined by white fruit aromas, while the palate is a bit flat in feel but lively enough. It tastes of papaya and peach, with a touch of green herb.
Part of a series highlighting the principal varieties of the Douro, this wine is made from the grape that is known as Tempranillo in Spain. It is structured and dense, with red-berry fruits and the beginnings of the smooth texture more familiar with the grape. The mineral texture and acidity give further complexity. Drink from 2018.
This offers fruit cocktail aromas, with canned pears and light honey, making for an inviting if not varietally typical nose. The flavors are light once sipped, closest to nectarine and apricot. This would be a very drinkable lunchtime wine.
This delicious Merlot exhibits fine and elegant aromas of blackberry, cherry, graphite and lingering tones of smoke and spice. The mouthfeel is enormously generous and intense and wine does a great job of keeping your interest, sip after sip.
Smooth, tropical and pure on the nose, with pineapple as the lead fruit. The palate is solid and full-bodied, with pineapple, papaya, honey and toasted flavors. Not “oaky” but it is well oaked, and thus the finish is warm, toasty and creamy. Drink now.
This blends 70% whole cluster-pressed juice with 30% saignée, vinified entirely in stainless steel. Fresh flower, cherry, strawberry and tangerine flavors wash brilliantly over the palate, lifted by acidity and just enough weight to feel lush.
An impressive Syrah, showing a good structure of acids and tannins and considerable complexity. Offers layers of blackberries, charred meat, moo shu plum sauce and exotic, peppery spices, wrapped into firm but finely-ground tannins. Drink over the next six years.
This crisp wine, flavored with black fruit is lightly tannic and deliciously full of lively fruit. It is full of juicy black-currant fruit and acidity with a soft texture that means it can be drunk now.
The aroma sends up hints of Bourbon-soaked raisins, leading onto a soft, smooth, and very pretty palate. There's plenty of raspberry flavor, and a suggestion of thick, dark balsamic vinegar on the finish. A dash of nutmeg, from 10 months in one-third new French oak, is the icing on the cake.
A fresh scent of green pears greets the nose. What follows comes in a light, crisp citrus vein, supported by a rounded mouthfeel. A refreshing wine for immediate drinking.
This wine is flat and simple, with touches of herbaceous earthiness and cedar. Plum and blueberry-fruit flavors are welcoming if lacking in complexity, with the finish offering a hint of cinnamon.
Starts out dry and leafy, then the spice and red-cherry aromas rise up. The palate is medium sized and mellow despite present acidity, and the flavors of juicy cherry and raspberry are more than solid. A fresh wine with good red fruit carry over from palate to finish.
There's a bit more fruit—cherry, cranberry—and no dust to this Cigare compared to other Bonny Doon bottlings, but blacker aromas of asphalt and char persist. The blend of 36% Syrah, 25% Grenache, 20% Mourvèdre and 19% Cinsault delivers strong tannins and flavors of a black-and-blue filet mignon topped with a wild berry reduction sauce
Oily and blowsy smelling, with almondy aromas and a pinch of citrus. The palate is heavy and chunky, with sweet, overripe flavors of pineapple and peach. Sweet and stalky on the finish.
This is a deliciously fruity, yet structured wine. It has weight and richness, but mainains elegance with lemony acidity, ripe grapefruit flavor, and layered wood notes. It's a wine for long-term aging so drink from 2015.
Fleshy melony aromas are devoid of any sharpness. This feels chunky but balanced, with peach-pit flavors and citric undertones. A clean short finish seems right for this basic white.
A good everyday red wine, rich and sweet in dark berrry, chocolate and smoked meat flavors, wrapped into smooth tannins. It's soft and ready for drinking now.
With its bold aromas of cotton candy and two-cent bubblegum, this is just too tutti-frutti to rate higher. That said, if you like the style, it's a solid, well-made example, filled with bouncy fruit while finishing dry and refreshing.
This subtle, graceful Syrah acknowledges the cool vintage and takes full advantage of what it has to offer. It's based upon elegantly-layered citrus and sappy berry fruit flavors, with just a delicate hint of clean earth.
This is a tight, sharp, pungent Viognier, with penetrating scents of lemon oil and pine. In the mouth it is grapefruity and slightly bitter, with a perception of almond skin as it fades away.
This Merlot-dominated blend is sourced exclusively from the Stillwater Creek Vineyard. The entry-level red blend from Baer, it's a broad, spicy, somewhat peppery wine, reflecting the cooler vintage and northern site. The listed alcohol does not show in the palate, which tilts a little toward the green side, and falls away rather quickly.
A good, richly flavored Cabernet that shows proper varietal character without any special qualities. Flavors of blackcurrants drink dry, wrapped in smooth tannins. May improve a bit with a few years in the cellar.
There's a tiny touch of apple skin volatility and fresh raspberry that give this wine enormous lift and buoyancy. But there are also grounding aromas of leather and old spice that render a sense of intensity and sophistication.
This lovely Verdelho is perfumed with jasmine and apricot. It's crisp and creamy while also tasting refreshing and light. The finish is all lime salt and minerality. Pour it at an outdoor soirée or sip it while cooking dinner.
This is impressive on many fronts, not least of which is the fact that it is one of the first wines in Italy to boast a glass cork. The glass works wonders helping to preserve a wine with intense and pristine floral, nutty—especially almonds—and mineral aromas.
Notable for very high acidity, this Chard would be aggressive were it not for the ripe, honeyed flavors and creamy texture, which soften it up. The flavors are very pure and clean: of kiwi, lime, mango and papaya.
Deep purple fruit aromas of dried blackberries and pressed plums benefit from a fresh dill edge as well as a umami element on the nose of this wine from the Rice family, which started making wine in 1990. The acidity and alcohol combine for a tongue-tantalizing sip, with flavors of black cherries and dark herbs.
Some overripe raisin flavors give this Zin a bitter taste, although it's totally dry. Shows flavors of chocolate and spicy blackberry jam.
The sweet smell of campfire meets with bacon fat, dried purple flowers, black tea, licorice, espresso and just a razor's edge of ripe fruit. It's delicious on the palate, with rich raspberry fruits, dried strawberry, mocha and a minty sensation that lingers amidst the noticeable tannic grip.
Made with Nero d'Avola and other Sicilian grapes, this offers fruity aromas of dark berry and a whiff of dark spice. The straightforward palate shows ripe black cherry and blackberry while notes of ground black pepper add interest. It's easy drinking so enjoy soon.
A distinctive, sweet, resiny note dominates the aromatics, suggesting an herbal flower such as calendula. Those notes highlight the flavors as well, with hints of pollen, fresh herb and ripe apple.
Dark-skinned berry, moist earth and blue flower aromas lead the nose on this. The lean straightforward palate offers raw cherry and a hint of clove alongside bracing acidity and fleeting tannins.
From the range of single-varietal bottlings from Alorna, this wine is perfumed and crisp, with bright lemon and tangy citrus flavors. It is a delicious, young, fruity and ready to drink.
Made from organically grown grapes, this thick, creamy Viognier has great perfume and weight and shows an expertly handled balance between ripeness and oak.
Very crisp and apple flavored, it has bright acidity and a light, gentle texture of minerality. It is ready to drink now, although waiting until 2015 will bring out more depth of flavor.
Almost black in color, this prestige 100% Malbec cuvée is as intense as it is powerful. Dark and brooding, still very young, it shows its wood aging strongly. As it ages, this richness will mellow well to give a concentrated while stylish wine. This small-production wine is named after a statue of Notre Dame in the vineyards of this family estate taken over by daughter Martine and husband Serge Costes 20 years ago. Drink from 2019.
A juicy blackberry jam flavor shows in this robust Cabernet. It's dry, tannic and a little rough. Drink it soon with rich beef dishes.
Ripe, jammy and forward, Prima could become the blueprint for affordable but well-made Toro wines. It's a modern bruiser from a modern, spotless facility, and it offers a clash of wild berry flavors, big-time tannins and powerful acidity. Like most Toro wines, it'll take your cheeks to the cleaners if you don't have meaty foods, cheese or lots of water to go with it. Drink now through 2012.
94-96. Barrel sample. Big and powerful, this is a wine that is supported by dense tannins. The feeling is dry and firm, with a brooding black-currant character.
The 2011 Resonance Reserve has just a bit more concentration than the elegant regular bottling. There seems to be more new barrel influence as well, offering proportioned touches of milk chocolate, nougat and caramel. All in all, this is a tasty wine with fine length and impressive detail.
This hearty and heavily spiced take on the grape offers fascinating black cherry, cardamom, chai spice and sanguine, meaty scents on the nose. The flavors may strike some palates as too intense, brimming with dried red cherry, Indian spice and kalamata olive, bound by energetic acidity and tactile grip.
Red cherry, vanilla, spicebox and a touch of flowers leads the nose on this poised Merlot/Limnio blend. On the palate, the wine is elegant and laced with clove, mushroom and bright berry flavors. A unique wine at an unbeatable price.
Opens with lactic, slightly raisiny aromas that turn oakier and creamier with airing. Dense, rubbery and intense on the tongue, with dark flavors of blackberry and herb in the middle. Finishes long, earthy and slightly herbal, with tannic bite and grip. Drink now through 2014.
This is one of those fresh, young Cabs that reminds you of Beaujolais. It's fruity and silky and jammy, with a pink bubblegum gassiness. Give it a chill, cut it with some sparkling water, put in a slice of strawberry and enjoy.
Pretty and delicately spicy, with notes of dried fruit and Asian pear. There's a core of bright acidity here, noticeable despite the high level of residual sugar, that makes for a refreshing finish. A great choice for Dim Sum.
With the normally more northern Alvarinho in the blend, this wine has considerable freshness. That is mitigated by the wood aging that has broadened the wine and brought out tropical and yellow fruit flavors. The wine is ready to drink.
Too sugary for a table wine. With its sweet cherry, berry and spice flavors, it's more like a dessert wine.
A very cherry wine, with tight acidity and some green on the finish; a cool-vintage wine.
Full-bodied and intense, this is a rich, ripe Cabernet for drinking now–2018. Cassis fruit is tinged with hints of mint, chocolate and vanilla, and while the tannins are velvety soft, the finish remains fresh.
This vibrantly aromatic wine brings generous notes of honey, pineapple, papaya and apricot. It's intensely sweet and rich in flavor and feel, lingering on the finish.
As usual, the 2009 Bello Rosso is a 50-50 blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon. Almost magisterial, this wine is forceful and balanced, and it is packed with black fruits that are matched to the perfectly ripe tannins.
This is an intense wine, robustly ripe and showy in oak. It tastes of baked apple and vanilla wood.
Smells strongly of corn, stalky fruit, herbs and grass. Mouthfeel is not a problem, although it's a little sticky on the palate. Tastes heavily herbal and green, with an oaky covering. Short, woody and herbal on the finish.
A good, everyday Pinot Noir. It's somewhat rugged, with jagged tannins, and the flavors are direct and simple, suggesting cherry jam and buttered cinnamon toast. But the silky texture is pure Pinot Noir.
The official residual sugar reading is .77%, but you don't need a degree in fruit chemistry to know that this is a sweet wine, more appropriate as a dessert sipper than as a dry table wine. It's clean and vibrant in sugared apricot, peach and pineapple flavors.
A terrific Cabernet that shows vast improvement over the winery's earlier efforts. In fact, you could place it next to far more expensive Napa bottlings. It's dry and elegantly tannic and complex, showing blackberry, currant, violet, herb and cedar flavors that bring to mind a fine Bordeaux. Drink now with upscale fare.
Modest black cherry and berry aromas are earthy and a touch flat. This is a full-bodied Malbec with baked blackberry as the lead flavor and oaky, savory, saucy side notes. Residual dark-berry flavors and chewy tannins drive the finish.
Sweet and simple, with strong, honeyed flavors of pineapples, peaches, green apples, vanilla and buttered popcorn. Crisp, coastal acidity fortunately provides balance.
This is a pert, pretty Cabernet Franc fragrant of Maraschino liqueur, sage and tarragon. It's forward in oak with wide swathes of toast and char, but elegantly balanced with crisp blackberry and black cherry flavors. Finishes with a murmur of soft tannins.
Floral notes of chamomile and lavender overwhelm the bouquet, with secondary notes of black plum, berry and currant taking second stage. Cured meat and sweet smoke flavors unfold in the mouth and stay into the spice-driven finish.
A new discovery for me, this estate is turning out some very good wines from its vineyards in Gigondas and Beaumes-de-Venise. Perhaps its biggest 2004 is this richly warm Gigondas, which is filled with dried fruit and spices. It finishes with supple tannins and layers of spicy intensity.
Alain Cailbourdin makes three different wines from his three vineyards. Les Cornets is the softest of the three, a pleasingly ripe wine that offers almonds, green herbs, full quince and kiwi fruits.
A lush, crisp, eminently drinkable Sauvignon. Meyer lemon, pineapple, white peach, tangerine, spicy green melon and fig flavors are enriched with smoky, creamy oak.
The residual sugar is a hefty 54g/L. Soft flavors of canned peaches and apricots fill the mouth immediately, then turn watery as the wine quickly slides into a lighter finish.
Delicious is the word that comes to mind drinking this Pinot Noir. It's young and vibrant in acidity, with waves of raspberries, persimmons, honey, cinnamon, cloves and smoky sandalwood. Good over the next five years.
This blend of Touriga Nacional and Merlot gives fresh red fruits that are crisp and sharp as a needle. The wine is lively and fruity, soft and ready to drink.
Trentadue is building up a pretty good track record with this old-fashioned, field blend-style wine. Although the '04 isn't their best effort, it's dry and well-structured in acids and tannins, with a rich, earthy tang of tobacco and dried fruits. Mainly Sangiovese, Cab Sauvignon and Merlot.
With a bright violet color and jammy boysenberry and black-cherry aromas, this amounts to a fruity, chunky blend of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. On the palate, blackberry flavors run inky and come with a lot of oak and vanilla. A round, creamy finish is chewy and lush. Drink through 2019.
For fans of semisweet bubbly in a bright salmon shade, this sparkler offers a confected nose reminiscent of watermelon Jolly Ranchers. Softly pétillant with a heavy, syrupy texture, the palate is akin to liquid cotton candy.
Inviting aromas of butter, almond and citrus open into a rich, thickly textured wine studded with peach, almond butter and citrus pith. The slightly bitter notes echo through the finish, providing a welcome sense of balance to round mouthfeel and fatty flavors.
Ripe fleshy blackberry and plum notes are pristine and pretty in this richly textured Cabernet Sauvignon. It's densely concentrated on the palate, but brisk acidity and glimmers of violet, lavender and graphite lend levity and freshness. Approachable already yet regal with fine firm tannins, it's ready to drink now but should continue to improve for at least another decade.
Bright in cherries, orange peel, raspberry Newton and cinnamon pepper, this Pinot is racy in acidity. Finishes light and delicate. Drink now.
This wine sources this rare variety from Saralee's Vineyard in the heart of the appellation. Meaty strawberry meets refreshing acidity and ample structure, taming the big boldness of flavor, all while remaining light and bright in the glass.
This relatively new Bannockburn producer has turned out a supple, creamy 2004 that boasts plenty of red fruit aromas and flavors, ranging from raspberry to cherry and strawberry. Crisp and juicy on the finish.
Layers of pollen, dusty mineral and spice lend complexity to this concentrated wine full of yellow peach and fresh apple flavors. It's delicate and lithe in texture, yet punchy and penetrating.
From La Rioja, this Torrontés is quiet and neutral. It offers a little tangerine on the nose, and then acceptable but unexciting banana and pear flavors. Overall it's decent but bland.
Dusty tannins push to the front, resulting in a firm, wood-aged wine that shows smokiness, ripe blackberry flavors and a firm core. This should be at its best in 2–3 years.
Aromas of ripe plum, sunbaked earth and toast lead the way on this structured red. The palate offers dried black cherry, ground pepper and toasted oak while dusty tannins give it a firm, slightly astringent finish.
Medium-bodied and nearly completely dry, this is a stony, minerally expression of Riesling that even folds in some slightly earthy-peaty notes. Hints of citrus fall a bit short on the finish.
Still young and aromatic, this concentrated apple and pear flavored wine also has a strongly mineral character. It is laced with intense acidity that gives bite to the texture. It needs aging, so don't drink before 2017.
Mute on the nose, with only rubber cement and anonymous dark fruit showing up. Tastes of ripe plum, carob and burnt toast, while the finish offers vanilla shadings then a blast of heat. Not a smooth operator.
The deep ruby color belies this wines cool-climate origins. The nose shows more black fruit aromas than is typical for Pinot Noir. The palate is all Pinot, though, with cherry pie filling flavors made more complex by vanilla from toasty new oak. It finishes with some nice mineral and earth notes. Silky tannins allow for immediate consumption but the wine will gain in complexity after a year or two in the cellar.
When vineyards or, at least, land is in the family since the 15th century, it is interesting to taste their wines trending back to “bio.” This Baron de Montfort vineyard is certified organic. The result is fresh while also ripe, this is a lightly wood-tinted wine. It has a dry edge along with blackberry fruits and firm tannins. The acidity at the end acts as a counter-balance. Drink from 2019.
Pretty and pink, this light-colored wine has subtle peach aromas that continue to dry fruit flavors that are peachy and crisp. A little bite in the texture makes the mouth water.
Nasty and sharp, with candied LifeSaver flavors that have a weirdly medicinal, over-oaked taste.
This is an attractive, perfumed wine that has good wood aging, firm tannins and a solid structure. Dark berry fruits show through the texture, lending a ripe and juicy aftertaste. Drink from 2015.
This suggests freshly baked pear tart with baked Bramley apple and cushioned overtones of lemon-streaked pastry. Soft vanilla rings in the background but the twin pleasures of apple and pear take center stage. Earthiness provides grounding and more interest.
Fermented in concrete, then aged on lees for five months, this is a pretty expression of Chardonnay with popcorn butter, cream and white peach leading to a tart finish.
This Petite Sirah is made for drinking now. It's in a lighter style, soft and velvety, with pleasant berry, mocha, spice and tobacco flavors.
This excellent regional wine opens with aromas of black raspberry and iron. The palate shows sour pomegranate as well as thyme, bay leaf and dried oregano, framed by an earthy though relatively light structure.
This soft, fruity wine is pretty much ready to drink. With its red-berry fruits and fresh acidity it has a crisp side, although its round, ripe texture is so attractive. Drink from the end of 2016.
The grounded, earthy roundness of oak is immediately apparent on the nose, adding floral notes of hay and fresh field mushroom. On the pliable palate, aromatic, pale apple notes play with a touch of citrus and evocative hayflower notes. The body is light, with crisp freshness and a little midpalate texture. It finishes clean and bright.
Fruity, juicy wine, with some acidity pushing through the light structure. It is attractive, with a tangy, spicy edge.
Pungent and grassy upfront, with musky, herbal flavors buoyed by a base of pineapple and citrus. Impressively concentrated and long. Drink up.
One of Chile's longest-held superpremiums is Albis, a joint-venture wine of the Antinori family of Italy and the Matte family from Chile. With this vintage, early mossy and leathery aromas yield to cassis and cherry flavors. There's a leathery, cheese-like element to the finish, which is offset by sweeter coconut and chocolate flavors. At 73% Cabernet Sauvignon and 27% Carmenère, Albis comes on strong the longer it sees air.
This Aglianico from Irpinia is thin in appearance and offers awkward notes of apple cider, black mineral, cherry, blueberry and spice. The nose is a bit muddled but the wine drinks well thanks to its solid structure and polished tannins.
Attractive and generously fruity, this offers flavors of apples and peaches and a mouthfilling mousse of bubbles. The texture is slightly soft but appetizing.
Considering the relatively light nature of the vintage, this wine has been overmanipulated. Hard tannins and a bitter chocolate flavor are all too much for the fruit. A gentler approach would have been better.
This wine has dry tannins and some concentration as well as the bright, cherry-fresh Beaujolais fruit. That gives it a serious side with structure and potential. The 100% Gamay vineyard is on slopes in the heart of Beaujolais Villages. Drink from 2016.
Dusty spice and red-berry aromas are a fine opening to this blend of Garnacha, Carignan, Cab Sauvignon and Syrah. It's fairly full bodied but not heavy, with fine balance and bright flavors of cherry and berry that come in layered waves. A toasty, dry finish with spice and good acidity closes out this easy-to-like Spanish red. Drink through 2017.
This is a big, flavorful wine, luscious in aroma, flavor and texture from the first whiffs of spicy oak and funky earth through saturated blackberry and clove flavors. The texture is both velvety and almost stiff at the same time. Drink now through 2020.
This 100% varietal wine was aged 18 months in American oak and is vaguely pharmaceutical in aromas. Its elusive fruit stays wrapped in thick, unforgiving tannin.
Organic, with clean, solid, forward aromas that blend in ginger and dust. The opening flavors are of orange and tangerine, while the second layer deals yeast and other drier elements. Great feel and balance, with zest throughout as well as touches of vanilla. Imported by Organic Vintners.
The blend in this Pauillac-inspired cuvée is based on Cabernet Sauvignon, resulting in a wine that's slightly more structured than the others. Tobacco and cassis pick up hints of toffee and brown sugar on the finish. Drink now–2015.
This small-production wine is dense in currant and licorice tones, both generous and lengthy on the palate. Firm tannins lend solid structure, with ample acidity to balance. A clove flavor adds depth to the fruit and lingers on the enduiring finish.
Rooty licorice, leather and olive aromas are solid, with pleasing berry scents. This feels plump, with a touch of tartaric acid popping up. Peppery plum and olive flavors are textbook for the variety, while the finish is forward and robust.
Staunch berry, cassis and spice aromas are friendly and congruent. This Malbec-led blend is jammy in feel, a bit hollow in the middle, and easy to like as a whole. Blackberry and blueberry flavors finish fleshy, with soft tannins.
Rubbery and drying, with aromas of barrel char and butter that overpower any fruit that might want to escape. Simple plum and cherry flavors work the palate, but they're fading. And the finish is drying and lightly tannic.
88-90 Barrel sample. Lemon aromas of surprising intensity allow this wine to stand out from the crowd. But they also give give it a dry, firm feel with acidity more dominant than sweetness.
Wow. This is one big, impressive Sauvignon Blanc. It's the grass and gooseberry, and the acidity. The wine hits the palate like a bomb, dry and crisp and explosive. Mid-palate, the fruit emerges, peaches, figs, melons, limes, kiwi. This is De Loach's first OFS Sauvignon and it's worthy of the designation.
Once you cut through an astringent edge, this becomes a simple, fresh, fruity wine dominated by white fruit. There is attractive acidity, the crisp apple flavors layered with spice.
This opens with aromas of dried black currant, roasted coffee beans, oak and aniseed. The warm, low-acid palate offers dried black fruit, licorice, dark chocolate and vanilla, but not much fruit richness. The smooth texture is cut short by wood tannins that impart an astringent finish.
Grapy aromas of cassis and blackberry are fairly foxy, with a whiff of wet animal fur. An intense palate is held together by firm, rubbery tannins. Black cherry and dark-plum flavors are lasting on a finish that's ripped with intensity. Best from 2019–2024.
This 100% Syrah is rich and ripe in blackberry jam and new oak flavors. It's dry, with a fruity sweetness, and the tannins are strong but yielding. High alcohol gives it a hot feeling. Barbecue is your best bet.
A nosing reveals pineapple juice; it's a bit too forward and sharp. In the mouth, lemony flavors mix with buttery oak. It finishes heavier than it should, but still it's pretty clean. In total, it's simple, juicy, properly acidic white wine, but nothing more.
Pickled aromas are obvious on the chunky, warm bouquet, and never does the wine shed its green personality. The palate offers brown sugar and baked fruit, while the finish leaves an impression of carob and green bean.
Fleshy in cantaloupe and pear, this subtle, low-impact white has a touch of acidity that keeps it fresh and refreshing. While the backbone is light bodied, it finishes clean and lean.
A great value bargain, this fresh Inzolia offers aromas of cut grass, lemon zest, pear and Golden Delicious apple. Pair it with smoked salmon dishes.
Very rich and ripe, this barrel-fermented blend of Roussanne and Grenache Blanc tastes almost as sweet as a dessert wine, with unctuous, glyceriney flavors of pineapple tart, lemon custard and vanilla fudge. But it's technically dry, with fine acidity and a clean finish. A very good wine that will challenge sommeliers when it comes to food pairing.
Here's a lightly colored pink rosé sparkler with subtle aromas of peach, rose petal, citrus and honeysuckle. It's an elegant and refined wine that would work well with white water fish or delicate shellfish.
New leather, menthol, ripe berry and Asian spice aromas emerge in the glass while the firm palate offers dried black cherry, pomegranate, star anise and a hint of game. You'll also notice a green note of powdered sage. Assertive, close-grained tannins squeeze the finish.
From a 1,700-foot vineyard high above the valley comes this compellingly delicious Zinfandel. A word of caution: The alcohol is 16.6%. But the wine isn't at all hot, and high alcohol is the price you pay for the lush, ripe fruitiness achieved in this scorching vintage. Brims with cherries, blackberries, raspberries, chocolate and spice, finishing long and dry.
Citrus blossom is evoked on the nose, aromatic mandarin peel and the dark, crushed foliage of citrus, too. On the palate there is a purity that is both mellow and taut, generous and restrained. The body is slender and willowy, while breezes of herbs and citrus come and go. Do not smother this dry, delicate veil of Riesling with big food. Choose light, delicate fare and this will simply sing.
Solid on the nose even if it's stretched thin with leather and cheese notes. The palate is fresh, zesty and scratchy, with tart red fruit flavors and limited density and richness. Turns lightly green and minty the more you get to know it.
Fresh and zesty, this opens with aromas suggesting white spring flower, pear and exotic fruit. The tangy palate offers white peach, citrus and pineapple while a mineral note accents the finish.
So classically structured and elegant, it might almost be a Bordeaux red variety instead of Zinfandel, except for the black pepper. Brings Napa-esque control and tannins to the blackberries, currants and chocolate, and should develop for up to 6 years.
Dusty dark-fruit aromas are lusty and full of oaky notes including sawdust and chocolate. This value-priced winner is full, round, saturated and generous on the palate, where savory, resiny black-fruit flavors finish woody in flavor and firm in feel.
Peach and bergamot, mirabelle plum and lemon zest, ripeness and freshness, amplitude and sleekness: whoever loves to trade in juxtapositions will love this expressive, irresistible wine. Etched with very clear contours it nonetheless delivers generous, gorgeous fruit.
Too many California Sangiovese suffer from all sorts of problems, mainly unripeness. But this one is soft and smooth and juicy. It offers rich flavors of cherries, red currants, chocolate, anise and pepper, and will be fine with a grilled steak, or even tempura veggies dipped in soy sauce.
Aromas of Spanish broom, honeysuckle and a yeasty note lead the nose of this Sicilian sparkler from Mount Etna. The palate offers ripe apple, candied citrus and bitter walnuts alongside persistent bubbles and zesty acidity.
Wild red berries, crushed pepper, lilacs and a frame of asphalt show on the exuberant nose of this bottling. The palate is loaded with meat, smoke, cedar, charcoal and easy boysenberry flavors, the perfect pairing for a hamburger. It is a tad light in body, especially since it hasaged for so many years.
Although this Garnacha Blanca shows rustic, cidery aromas, it displays a balanced, layered, round palate with vital acidity. Salty, savory peach and apple flavors are true to white Garnacha, while a long, salty finish is full of energy.
Probably the most lush of Alta Vista's three single-vineyard Malbecs from 2009, Alizarine offers coconut, cola and wild berry aromas, with a full-bodied, chunky palate that's packed with coconut, carob, cassis and sweet blackberry flavors. Smooth, oaky and stylish on the finish, this is rewarding now–2015.
There are some lean, green peppercorn, mint and herb flavors that suggest unripeness. The chilly vintage appears to have taken its toll, despite some well-oaked raspberry and cherry lushness. Drink up.
Kind of big up front, with creamy oak aromas along with smoky notes of molasses and barbecue. Thick and fruity on the palate, with milk chocolate draping raspberry and cherry fruit. Staunch tannins on the finish are softened by sweet fudge flavors. And through it all you get a little tomato.
This is the pinnacle of achievement from an outstanding dessert wine producer. A blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Blanc, it is an explosion of hugely rich, hugely sweet fruit, with brown sugar, raisins and tight acidity. This is an astonishingly rich wine, likely to age for at least 10 years.
Bell pepper and tomato aromas, combined with hot and burnt notes, don't make for a very inviting nose. The palate is acidic, leaving tart plum and cranberry flavors in front of an oaky, citrusy finish. Rough and basic.
This is a thin, hard and tight version of the estate wine. It shows a bit more depth, but it's compact and slow to unravel. The oak is delivering butterscotch and vanilla, laid on as a buttery finish. This is too young to drink right now.
Dense purple in color, with bold aromas of coconut, chocolate, mint and wild berries. Don't expect an overly fat Syrah. The wine has body, extract, chewy berry fruit and tannin, but it also has bouncy acidity that almost tilts it toward choppy. With food, however, it will more than do the trick. Imported by Excelsior Wine & Spirits.
Raspberry compote, star anise, grilled herb and sun baked earth and a whiff of leather are some of the aromas you'll find on this structured Barolo. On the full-bodied palate, chopped mint, licorice and tobacco accent ripe Morello cherry and juicy raspberry. Give this time to fully develop. Drink 2020–2028.
This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (40%), Merlot (35%) and Cabernet Franc comes from Bacchus, Dionysus, Weinbau and Seven Hills vineyards—some of the top vineyards in the state. Dark roasted coffee bean, char, herb and cherry aromas lead to restrained fruit and barrel flavors that show a fine sense of elegance. It delivers a lot of quality and value.
Crisp grapefruit and celery aromas set up a round palate with a pulpy texture. Flavors of scallion, citrus peel and grape skins finish citrusy on one hand and pyrazinic on the other. Possibly of interest, this was fermented and aged in egg-shaped concrete tanks.
This is a wood aged wine, full of vanilla flavors as well as fragrant fruitiness. It has great flavor intensity, with bright notes of juicy green plum and grapefruit that are framed by acidity and a tight, mineral texture. It needs some years aging, so drink from 2018.
Notes of orange and lemon preserves on the nose lead into flavors of orange, lemon and vanilla on the palate. It finishes with a touch of spice.
Shows that typical enormous Santa Lucia fruit that's so massive that it just stuns. Offers gobs of cherry marmalade, blueberry pie filling, pomegranate and cola-root beer flavors, yet the wine somehow stays silky-elegant. Who knows where it's going, but it's delicious now.
From an estate vineyard and given very little oak, this white sings in Key-lime pie and orange blossom, a heady, floral liquid invitation that gives way to unctuous texture and medium weight. Chalky somewhat on the finish, it should continue to integrate over time.
Oak Knoll's Pinot Gris is a sturdy, steady expression of the grape's main strengths. Vintage in and vintage out, the wine has plenty of ripe apple and pear fruit flavors, with citrusy highlights and a splash of refreshing acidity.
In an era where size is everything, a wine like this makes you appreciate true balance. It has all the rich fruit, spice, cream and oak you could want in a Chard, but maintains elegance. So easy to drink, and yet so refined.
There's 19% Syrah and 5% Petite Sirah blended in, making for a succulent wine, with spicy, lively fruit leading the charge. There's enough acid to give it structure and balance, but not so much that the wine seems edgy or sour. Full bodied, mouthfilling, flavorful and distinctive.
Unusually full-bodied and rich for a 2014, this is a big, muscular wine. The superripe plummy fruit is wrapped in a luxurious coat of chocolate-vanilla oak, yet finishes with drive to match its dusty tannins. Drink now–2025.
From sandy soil full of iron oxide, this blend of a range of Southwest grapes comes from a vineyard close to the Atlantic coast. It is a delicious fruity wine with lively acidity, green-fruit and citrus flavors plus a juicy zesty aftertaste. Drink this refreshing wine now.
This is rather soft on entry, a buttery, meaty, forward and appealing Pinot, with a layered palate of black raspberry, black cherry, sassafras, cinnamon and vanilla bean. The tannins are substantial and a bit green, but the edges are nicely honed, and the green tea bitterness is largely held in abeyance. The wine carries its 14.5% alcohol with graceful charm.
Youthful and compact, this shows a lot of unresolved oak aromas when first opened. Slowly more complexity emerges—rose petals, tart berries, anise, cedar and ground coffee. It's balanced, young and age worthy, but decant it if you plan to drink it anytime soon.
The aroma's fresh, clean and yeasty on this young nonvintage, brut-style sparkler. In the mouth, it's a little rough in texture, with forward flavors of peaches and limes. Give it a few years to begin softening.
Full of mango and starfruit flavors to go with the nuts, spice and ripe texture. The wine, made from organic grapes, has richness as much as sweetness, the acidity an important element. For long-term aging.
Upscale and pedigreed, but not showing well now. Too tannic, with an astringent lockdown that accentuates the acidity. Underneath are fine black cherry, cola, pepper and oak flavors. The suggestion is ageability, but the future of this wine is unpredictable no matter what anyone says.
Quite rich and viscous, with a full-blown core of bright cherry and herb flavors. Spice-like cinnamon and nutmeg also find expression here, framed in very soft tannins. Good acidity holds it together, while the finish is pleasingly long.
Smells and tastes not quite ripe. Now that the wine is softening and resolving at the age of 3-1/2 years, it's showing a streak of veggie green behind the cherries.
This wine just avoids an excessive amount of wood. Instead the wood flavors enhance the black-plum and berry fruits. It is a dry wine, dense and firm. It does need time, so wait until 2018.
Aromas of dark berry, violet, mint and menthol lead the nose and carry over to the palate together with juicy cherry and a note of baking spice. This is still tightly wound with densely packed but refined tannins and brisk acidity. Give it time to open up and blossom over the next few years. Drink 2018–2026.
The wine is rich and still shows firm tannins, along with full-bodied blackberry fruitiness and a tight, crisp texture. It's solid and concentrated, full of juiciness at the end. Drink from 2016.
After a whiff of iodine arises, the nose on this blend of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon offers mostly jammy berry scents in front of a full palate containing zesty acidity. Flavors of red plum, salt, cherry and cranberry finish long and without any excess weight or push.
This wine reflects the difficulty of the cool, wet 2014 vintage. It's lean and diluted, with medicinal sensations that recall adhesive bandage and mineral.
Lots of oak on this Chardonnay, but it's awkward, and feels overworked and sweetly simple, despite some pretty pineapple jam flavors.
The junior of the two wines produced by the Barton family, this is a subtle, classic wine. Structure and firm tannins sit alongside the perfectly formed, under-stated red and black fruits.
Straw colored in the glass, this dry Muscat has pineapple, dried rosemary, peach and apple blossom aromas. White peach and apricot flavors mark the palate and lead to a crisp finish.
Odd that this wine costs less than Wellington's Sonoma Valley bottling, because while it shares the same qualities of cassis, smoke and a smooth texture, it's a shade richer and more concentrated. Feels absolutely beautiful as it slides across the palate, all the way through the pleasing aftertaste.
While the wine is structured, it does also have plenty of ripe, juicy fruitiness that is already delicious. It's an open wine, rounded and rich in fruit flavor. The tannins are likely to smooth out soon, so drink from 2016.
A full, rich wine, showing red fruits at their best. It has structure and layers of bright acidity. It's not a wine for long aging, likely to be at its best in three years time.
Apple, pear and stone-fruit flavors are vibrant and fresh from nose to finish of this delicately sweet Kabinett. It offers uncomplicated refreshment, but is anchored with taut acidity and honed, steely minerality. The finish is long and persistent.
White peach, Bartlett pear, grapefruit and Granny Smith apple take center stage on this linear, refreshing wine. Mineral and almond notes add depth while crisp acidity gives generates a clean, bright finish.
With its orange-pink color, this rosé is showing the good results of nearly a year's bottle age. That has filled out the fresh red fruits and given the lively texture a touch of toast. It is drier than it used to be, a structured and ripe wine that is ready to drink. As with its white counterpart, this Cuvée de Moins Brut is designed as a food wine.
A wild, spicy, gamy thread runs through this flavorful, dry and appetizing wine. It smells like earth, leather and smoke, and tastes like black pepper and blackberry but is rather light bodied. It's not for everybody, but adventurous drinkers will appreciate the originality and personality.
This is a blend of 70% Merlot, with Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Mourvèdre. It spent almost two years in 60% new oak, and the oak dominates both the nose and the palate. Sharp edged and showing more than a hint of stem and herb, it finishes with a wash of vanilla-soaked cherry fruit.
Produced in an estate created in the 1980s, this wine is soft, gentle and warm. The 5% of white grapes in the blend adds extra lightness to the wine. A mineral edge along with pepper brings another dimension to the red fruits. Bone-dry, it is more of a food than apéritif wine.
There is a strong sense of herbaceousness in this wine. A blend of Sémillon, Sauvignon Blanc and Alvarinho, it is fresh and crisp with lemon and pear flavors. A short wood aging has allowed the wine to round out and get a toasty feel. Drink from 2015.
Slightly stalky on the nose, with aromas of haystack and snappy citrus fruits. The palate is citrusy and acidic, with flavors of orange and grapefruit. Rounds into form with airing and time in the glass, but overall it's just a modest, regular SB for basic purposes.
White flowers and lime skins juxtapose smoke and slate on the nose of this ethereal kabinett. Delicately sweet, as if gilded by hibiscus nectar, it fills the palate with waves of sunny yellow-stone fruit and tart lemons. A lovely wine that should show its youthful effervescence through 2020.
Take a blend of five Bordeaux grapes, toss in some Syrah, and voilà—you have your 2011 Bramble Bump Red. Smooth and silky, loaded with purple fruits set against a backdrop of licorice and dark chocolate, this delicious wine finishes with a burst of coffee.
Although it kicks off on the stewy, baked side of the fence, airing reveals good fruit and ample wood; indeed, there's brandied cherry, vanilla and chocolate to ponder. Long on the finish, albeit a finish that's one-note simple. A little stark in terms of feel.
Smooth and sweet, it's ripe with flavors of strawberry preserves. Liberal accents of chocolate and coffee speak to substantial barrel time, and there is more than a hint of sweetness across the palate. But for those who like a big, blocky, ripe style, it's quite tasty.
This thick, extracted wine is made from 70% Pallagrello and 30% Casavecchia grapes, a portion of which was overripened on the vine. It opens with aromas of leafy underbrush, oak, toast, prune and vanilla. The lumbering, monolithic palate is sugary-sweet, offering vanilla extract, toasted oak and sugar plum.
Quite spicy, with a toasty, herbal edge. Citrus, peach and melon notes add a fruity theme. Clean at the end.
This is Morgan's fun Rhône blend. It's not meant to be worshipped or fussed over, just to wash down lusty meals. The flavors are of blackberries, cherries, cola and spices.
Jammy and fat. All primary fruit (cherries) and loads of toast. Itï¿½s rich and ripe, with loads of cherry fruit flavor, scads of sweet oak. Juicy acidity. Best 2006ï¿½2012.
An initial blast of musky earth wears off to reveal blueberry, blackberry and ripe red fruit. The wine performs well in the mouth thanks to firm tannins and good acidity.
Much like Apolloni's Olivia Vineyard Pinot Noir, this acidic, astringent wine seems severely constrained. The winemaking is solid, the fruit leans hard on tart red berries, but the wine has a hard shell around it. More bottle age might open it up.
This is a rich, impressive, age-worthy wine. With firm tannins and sumptuous juicy black fruits, it shows no sign of its high alcohol. It blends structure and fruit easily. The wine is named to celebrate the second Lança generation in charge at the estate. Drink from 2018.
A pace off the 2005, this single-vineyard wine, from the Sebastopol area, shows enormously ripe, powerful flavors of cherries, blackberries, raspberries, cola and vanilla. Fortunately, acidity is quite high, giving all that rich flavor a crisp bite.
Ripe and fruity, this has weight that's balanced by a mineral, steely character. A taut, tight character emerges, and the concentrated citrus and pineapple flavors complete the mix. Age this for 3–4 years.
Vanilla, clove, baking spice and dark fruit aromas lead to a palate plush with full ripe generous fruit and barrel flavors. It's a hedonistic delight, with the barrel influence playing a prominent role.
Nearly always one of New Zealand's top Sauvignons, this wine makes a big, bold statement. Aromas are herbal and leafy, with undertones of tomato and nettles, but buffered by gooseberries and minerality. It's rich and weighty on the palate, with a creamy texture that brings ripe stone fruit flavors to the fore. Long and mouthcoating on the finish.
This is one of those Chardonnays that takes ripe fruit and then drenches it in oak. It's all too much. The orange, apricot and mango flavors have a buttered toast, caramelized richness that turns cloying despite brisk acidity.
Plum, herb, blue fruit, vanilla and spice aromas lead to soft, plush fruit flavors in this wine. The texture and blue fruit flavors bring appeal.
From basalt rock soil, this is a tightly coiled wine. The wine brings out strong minerality, a firm texture and ripe fruit. A touch of pepper adds spice and a dense character. The wine needs to age; drink from 2017.
There's no mistaking the variety here, with its attention-getting aromas of flowers, mandarin orange and ripe peach, along with lime-zest accents. It drinks off dry, with a plentiful, rich, flavorful palate. There's loads of enjoyment to be had.
Despite a growing number of quality sweet-style Rieslings from the Finger Lakes, this one stands out amongst its peers. It's gorgeously complex, with layers of pollen and saffron accenting deep, concentrated flavors of mango, orange and peach. Searing lemon acidity drives the midpalate towards a long finish that's peppered with dusty mineral notes. Delicious now, but bound to be irresistible from 2021–2024.
Fine, simple red Burgundy, with soft tannins, jellied raspberry flavors good broad texture. Obviously not for aging, but a pleasure to drink.
This 55/45 Cab-Merlot blend is a gem. The aromas are rich with blackberries, black currants and black olives; and in the mouth the two grapes are nicely balanced and full-bodied. Nothing wimpy here—this puts most other such blends to shame. You'll pick up a hint of licorice and a touch of herb as well.
Made from 96% Grenache Noir and 4% Syrah, this is a fresh, pretty and easy to like rosé, with attractive notes of peony, strawberry top, orange blossom and thyme. The mouthfeel is light, but flavorful, with a pleasant citrus-pith and watermelon-rind bitterness that lingers on the finish.
Smoky and meaty, with nut, white-peach and clove notes. Firm acidity allowed 100% barrel fermentation without the wine becoming overly soft.
This win is dense and dusty, with ripe ripe red and black fruit, meat and earth. The palate follows with fine-grained tannins and bright acidity. A plush, powerful Shiraz.
Dineen and Red Willow 'Les Vins de Marcoux' supply the fruit for this complex, aromatic Syrah. A fecund melding of compost, chicken yard and chocolate accents surround a core of berries and cherries. Ripe, round and mouth-filling, it's not at all overpowering, but has the style and complexity to hold your interest through the entire bottle.
Big, sturdy and extracted in blackberries, black currants and molasses, with a meaty edge, almost like a Syrah. The tannins are thick and furry and astringent, but the wine is flashy and complex. Hard now, but give it 5–6 years, and it could age well beyond that.
Maculan is celebrated for its excellent expressions of international grapes grown in the Veneto. This easy blend of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon offers a cheerful bouquet of cherry fruit and mild exotic spice.
A taut wine, laced with acidity, citrus fruits and green apples. It's textured, mineral and steely in character, with perfumed Williams pears to add sweetness.
This is a ripe, vigorous young Petite Sirah. It's strong in tannins, with just enough acidity to make the black currant, roasted meat, plum and cedar flavors bright. This needs time; give it 5–6 years, and it should glide through 2020.
Soft, simple and a little baked, this Zin has a trace of cooked raisins, and a hot feeling from high alcohol. It will sustain Italian food and barbecue.
This is a great Merlot that's intensely concentrated and dazzlingly rich—everything you want a Merlot to be. It's power packed with black cherries, cherry liqueur, cocoa and sweet oak, with firm, hard tannins. That is, of course, the Nickel & Nickel style. It shows classic Oakville structure and a hard-to-define elegance, making it one of the best Merlots of the vintage.
The nose gives almost nothing away, while the palate discloses only a little pear fruit, boosted by some residual sweetness that makes this wine off dry. It has a gentle, easy charm. Drink soon.
This wine has a nose of lingonberry, juniper berry and toffee. It is round in the mouth, with flavors of black cherry, red plum, cranberry, spearmint, and caramelized sugar. An element of toffee fills the palate as fruit flavors recede on the silky finish.
There's an inkling of Petite Sirah in this Cab-driven blend, an easygoing wine that's soft and enjoyable, with characteristics of herb, clove and black pepper. The fruit side of the equation is populated in black cherry and berry.
Pineau d'Aunis vines planted in 1920 by the grandfather of the estate's current owner have produced a smooth, ripe and spicy wine. It has some red fruits and acidity, but the edge of tannins in the texture gives the wine its real character. Drink now.
Some appealing floral highlights rub against flavors of orange crush, cherry soda and toasted cracker. This young wine seems structured for early drinking.
This vintage mixes fruit from Red Mountain and Alder Ridge (in the Horse Heaven Hills). Aromatic and soft, it's a five-grape Bordeaux-style blend, half Cabernet Sauvignon, and it carries that grape's herbal stamp. Tannins are a bit earthy, but the time in bottle has smoothed their rough edges. Drink up!
Grassy and sharp, with the acidic, gooseberry and pea vine character that New Zealand versions sometimes offer. But the aromas don't entirely bring the desired fruit follow-up, the wine falls out watery and thin, just not ripe enough.
Incredibly perfumed, with peppery spice, vanilla, anise and blackberries all forming a wonderful whirlwind of aromas. Yet despite the complexity and obvious concentration, it's not heavy at all, delivering masses of flavor without excessive weight or obtrusive tannin. Mouthfeel is slightly creamy, the finish is long and spicy; in short, it's the complete package. Drink now–2017.
A romantic name for an easy fruity wine. Spice from wood gives the black-currant fruit richness and some complexity. With its acidity and dry core, this is a wine to keep for another year. Drink from 2018.
Delicate sour cherry and plum flavors are intensified by notes of black coffee, fresh green herb and aromatic cedar. This medium-bodied Pinot Noir is earthy and savory, with refreshingly high acidity.
This ripe, lively wine is bursting with red fruits. Crisp and clean, it features a light mineral character that gives it tight texture balanced by refreshing raspberry and orange flavors. The aftertaste shines with crisp acidity.
This wine is good but not altogether convincing. It has a raw, nervous edge with aromas of root beer, tealeaf, cherry cola and a brambly-wild berry flavor in the mouth. The texture is sharp, compact and tight and the wine leaves lingering freshness on the close.
Fermented in wood and with the addition of a high proportion of reserve wines, this rich bottling displays a creamy texture and good acidity. It hints at the wood and is on the dry side of b
Le Pavillon is drawn from Les Bessards, the most granitic of Hermitage's climats, resulting in a wine with pronounced structure and minerailty. Hints of cinnamon and clove join plum and crushed stone on the nose, while the concentrated flavors suggest iron or beef blood as well. Drink 2015–2030.
Very tangy, nervous wine with lively acidity and crisp fruit. There is a fresh, very steely character, and a mineral, chewy aftertaste.
A generous wine, but one with good backbone and structure. The black fruits are beginning to meld into the sweet tannins and flavors of black cherry compote and spices. It is approaching maturity, but could age another 2–3 years.
This is a gorgeous rendering of grape and place. Steely at first, it shows off the coolness of the site, yet it's thick and inviting in apple skin, lemon bar and fresh-picked papaya. Minerality-driven, it never taxes the palate, instead releasing quiet waves of flavor and acidity.
A vineyard change in 2008 moves the source of the grapes north from Red Mountain to the Royal Slope. Young vines yield rather tight, bare flavors, with sweet grain and vanilla components contributed by the oak barrel (just one barrel was produced).
A flinty touch of promising reduction still hovers on the nose but cheeky floral and fruity hints of honeysuckle, jasmine and peach shimmer through. The palate unites all of these aromatic notions on a textured, layered and concentrated palate. The hints of honeysuckle spice are intensified by the ripe zestiness of Amalfi lemon and tangerine. The finish is dry and long, with ample refreshment from these gorgeous citrus notes. This is glorious now in its youthful exuberance but has the concentration, structure and fruit to age beautifully. Drink 2017–2035.
Made from Carricante grown on the steep slopes of Mount Etna, this opens with a fragrance of Spanish broom, lemon blossom, beeswax and citrus. The vibrant palate doles out nectarine, ripe green apple and toasted pistachio alongside bright acidity and an elegant mousse.
The wood aging of this wine has given a lightly oxidized character. It is rich and creamy with toasty acidity as well as yellow fruits. Drink now.
A nicely layered sparkling wine with fresh fruit and menthol or herb-like notes. Orange zest or tangerine crispness appears on the palate, punctuated by a sour note on the close. Imported by Bon Vivant Imports.
The 2009 Thomas Hyland Cabernet shows classic Penfolds styling in its robust mouthfeel and assertive flavors. Cherry, mocha and cedar notes turn a bit tart on the finish; drink now and over the next few years.
This excellent Dundee Hills vineyard supports a well-made, rather delicate wine, reflective of the lighter 2007 vintage. Strawberry fruit and tea-flavored tannins combine in a balanced, lightly tart, fairly simple Pinot Noir.
Made with only 30% whole-cluster, this bottling by Bradley Brown allows lusher red-cherry fruit to show on the nose, alongside slate, mint and sandalwood notes. Those same red-cherry elements meet with cranberry on the palate, growing more complex as layers of graphite, bay leaf, pine needle and turned forest floor arise.
Made without oak, this wine stars its natural flavors without barrel interference. And what a nice wine it is, with racy acidity and a stony minerality undergirding ripe flavors of lime, pink grapefruit, kiwi, white peach, apricot, chamomile tea and wildflowers. Finishes clean, spicy and wonderfully dry.
A great success for the vintage, this wine is firmly structured and expressive, bringing out a dark structure, ripe tannins and swathes of black fruits. Further generosity will develop as the wine matures. Drink from 2018.
Smells like Italian herbs, dry red fruits and tomato sauce, or in other words, a nice pizza. The palate is a bit tight and astringent for the variety, with cherry, blackberry and licorice flavors. Not super spicy or complex, but still tasty and varietally correct.
A solid effort, marrying a soft, mouthfilling texture with crisply delineated flavors of cherries and an herbal element. Silky tannins provide just enough structure to pair this wine with red meats. Drink now.
From an organically farmed vineyard, this rich, full-bodied wine offers flavors of baked plum, cherry and chocolate cake, taking on an edgy flirtation with toasted oak. It finishes with a sprinkling of black pepper and nutmeg, ready for a giant steak.
Herbal and tight, with a whiff of burnt rubber in front of some tart fruit. There is some concentration, and with more bottle age the wine may yet flesh out a bit.
While this wine isn't lacking concentration, its aromas are of stewed and overcooked fruit and it turns a bit sharp on the finish. No improvement with age.
Fairly rich and ripe, with pretty balck cherry, blackberry, spice, herb, leather and earth notes. The tannins are smooth, though the finish packs some forward brightness. A new style from a veteran winery. -J.M.
This bottling shows deep black plum, elderberry, rose and purple flower aromas. The palate is dense, with black plum and tart cranberry enhanced by Earl Grey tea and potpourri. Thanks to a strong tannic backbone and buoyant acidity, these flavors are interesting now but will meld together more compellingly in the years to come. Drink 2019–2034.
A slight apple scent perfumes the nose. The palate expresses more tart apple fruit and shows a central line of taut lemony freshness. The flavors are very clean and might need a little cellar age to come into their own. The finish is clean and dry. Drink now through 2020.
This attractive, fruity wine has soft tannins and a texture that is dominated by spice and fruit notes and acidity. It has a juicy red-cherry finish.
It's hard to find a $10 Cabernet with this much muscle and depth. Solid black cherry and cassis fruit anchors a wine with dark streaks of espresso, bitter chocolate and smoke. The tannins are nicely ripened also, and the wine leaves a chocolaty trail as it fades.
Tannic now, but with such a solid heart of fruit, it should blossom by the end of 2008 or early 2009. The color is translucent ruby, the texture wonderfully silky and light, except for those hard tannins. The flavors of blackberries, cherries, cranberries, cola and pomegranates are just waiting to emerge.
Add Raptor Ridge to the slender ranks of Oregon wineries producing this off-the-radar Alsatian grape. Sourced from the Zenith vineyard and aged 11 months in neutral oak, this is a tightly wound, lightly spicy white wine. Crisp peppery highlights somewhat recall a domestic Grüner Veltliner, and the barrel aging has begun to round out the sharp edges. Drink now through 2020.
This is a limited (two barrels) bottling from a Dundee Hills vineyard. Tight red currant fruit is streaked with licorice and baking chocolate. There's plenty of acid, not entirely integrated into the fruit, and a hint of caramel in the finish. Good components, though not yet a complete and seamless wine.
You'll find scents of red berry, chopped herb, clove and a balsamic note on this fragrant Nebbiolo, Vespolina and Croatina blend. The luminous palate delivers ripe cherry, juicy strawberry, white pepper, and menthol underscored by a mineral vein. It's elegant and intense but still austere at this stage, with a firm tannic backbone. Drink 2018–2031.
An exotic, dry and crisp Chardonnay, with plenty of toasty oak. Shows a mélange of dried orange, pineapple and pear fruit, with a minerally note. There's a feral quality that may be the result of native yeasts. Drink now.
Right away it strikes a fairly harmonious chord—it's fresh smelling, with good weight in the mouth. Nice lemon and grapefruit flavors carry a pithy edge, and there's plenty of length to the finish. The steely backpalate is where you get the acidity. As a whole, it's food-friendly and it shouldn't disappoint.
This is a solidly structured wine, with dry tannins that power through the acidity and black currant flavor. There is a sense of concentration, and the juicy acidity layers over the dark, dense character.
This is a heavy, full-bodied wine, with the weight of a Rhône variety, perhaps Grenache. Purists will criticize it for lacking the elegance you want in an expensive Pinot Noir. It's dry and tannic, with deep flavors of red currants, cherries, licorice, Canadian bacon and peppery spices. Could develop in the bottle, but it's risky.
One of Australia's most expensive and sought-after Cabernet blends, Mount Mary's Quintet has failed to impress more than one American critic. It's an appealing, well-crafted wine that combines leather, cherry and dried herbs in a somewhat lean, crisp style that delivers a long, mineral-and-cedar finish.
Yes, there are notes of sweet plum and pepper, but otherwise the wine is soft, with wafts of bacon and meat, the smooth tannins a tad dull.
A jammy raspberry aroma comes with a herb note and a pinch of varietal green. The palate is fresh, forward and well balanced, a nice home for plum, cherry and herb flavors. On the finish this is clean and fairly light in body, with some snappiness.
Always one of the most reliable and successful white Bordeaux brands, dominated by Sauvignon Blanc. The 2005 is a rich, tropical fruit and white currant-flavored wine. There is some green plum, fresh acidity and a hint of wood. Great as an apéritif, it also works well with sushi.
Rich, sweet, mouthcoating peach is accented by waxy tones of honeycomb, lanolin and spice in this delicately structured, yet powerfully fruity Riesling. It's sprightly with acidity, lingering long on the finish, with a flourish of spring blossoms. Gorgeous now, but bound to develop even more earthy richness over the next decade.
In the past, the winery made a Mendocino appellation Chardonnay from a mix of Anderson Valley and Potter Valley fruit. But in 2010, all of the fruit is sourced from the Anderson Valley. This is fleshy, soft and lush, bearing grapefruit and fig flavors that are wrapped in a tightly focused package with a bright finish.
With a fluorescent pink color, this Syrah-based rosé opens with cherry, raspberry and plum aromas. As a whole, it's basic but spunky on the palate, with adequate structural support. Raspberry, plum and citrus flavors finish firm and fresh.
Dark, dense, mossy aromas of leathery blackberry, baked black plum and forest floor feed into a grabby, heavy, slightly clumsy palate. Blackened flavors of baked plum, savory oak and peppery spice finish salty, resiny and woody.
So sweet. With sugary tangerine and pineapple flavors and plenty of caramel, it quickly palls.
Brambly notes that recall forest berry and wild blueberry are backed by a very attractive mineral vein that holds this wine's aromas tightly together. This is a crisp, bright Barbera d'Asti with a touch of bitter almond on the close.
Delaforce is a long-established brand that first appeared in the US in the 1930s though it came on the European market in 1878. The wine is sweet with that fascinating old wood character of an aged tawny. Toffee, spice and dried fruits give it a wide range of flavors. The wine, ripe and balanced, is ready to drink.
Ripe plum and berry aromas share the nose with heavy oak notes. This Tempranillo feels dry and tannic, while initially it tastes mostly like sawdust and oak. Deep digging and patience reveal briary berry and salty notes amid a lot of wood.
Here's a Cab that needs food to round it off and polish its rough edges. Very dry and a bit angular in tannins, with a peppery bite and generous flavors of cherries and blackberries.
A high-end Malbec experience at a reasonable price, this boasts rich aromas of cola, graphite and boysenberry that leap from the glass. The palate is bright and just thick enough, with wild berry, cherry, plum and oak-based flavors. Another whack of oak, along with vanilla, chocolate and tobacco flavors, graces the finish. Drink now–2015.
The hazy aromas of honeyed white fruits are a touch gaseous. It feels plump and nice, with soft, almost flat melon flavors. It tastes similar on the finish, showing little evolution from the palate.
An enormously fruity sparking wine, this one offers complex aromas of raspberries and baked bread, with a hint of lime. It really comes alive in the mouth, thanks to refreshing acidity and fine bubbles that scour the palate. This clean wine has just enough of a dose of sweetness to prod the fruit forward. Only 125 cases produced.
Initially subdued aromas of bramble, lime and herb are contrasted by loads of bright, juicy fruit on the palate of this radiant spätlese. Sweet-tart apricot and quince flavors seem gilded by crushed slate and honey. It's a tantalizing, deeply penetrating sip that catapults through a piercing lemon-lime finish.
Hints of crushed stone add a sense of minerality throughout this brisk, vigorously effervescent blend of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. It's penetrating on the palate through zippy lemony acidity, and finishes with a flair of honey and flowers on the finish.
Three-plus years in the bottle have been kind to this Pinot, letting the parts meld together. The oak is knitting with the cherry, raspberry and cola fruit, resulting in a creamy-sweet mouthfeel. Very nice, and should hold over the next 4–6 years.
Charred oak is prominent here as it is with most Long Island reds, but exceptionally well integrated within a rich, round wine full of supple dark chocolate and fruit flavors. A good example of yin and yang, Clovis Point's blend of Merlot, Cab Sauvignon and Franc, and Syrah offsets dense, sweet boysenberry and mocha notes with firm tannins and a dark char finish.
An impressive, ageworthy Riesling. It shows great depth of flavor, its intense, biting acidity shooting through the green apple and plum fruits. Very nervy, minerally and taut. Designed for longterm aging.
Made from 100% Cab, this wine is boldly fruity with flavors of black cherries and currants, along with toasted, caramelized marshmallows. The tannins are refined and there's good acidity for balance.
Made in a fruit-forward way, with jammy blackberry, cherry and currant flavors that finish in a swirl of chocolate and spices. It's a heartily tannic wine for drinking now. Good with slow-cooked meat stews and barbecue. Zinfandel, Petite Sirah, Charbono and Syrah.
Very big and dark, the deep cherry fruit here is cloaked—some might say overshadowed—by the intensity of the oak. Still, it possesses a stylish, suave quality and a good mouthfeel, even if it loses some typicity in the robe of international-style toast. Will be better in two or three years.
This wine offers an aromatic medley of sweet cherry fruit and chalky mineral tones. This Merlot with 10% Sangiovese has great texture and a threadwork of blueberry fruit, Pez candy and drying, dusty tannins on the finish.
Juicy strawberry jam and dried herb combine for a forceful attack of bold, concentrated flavor and robust body, the wine textured in dusty tannin.
Wisps of smoke and candle wax seem savory in contrast to the ripe stone fruit and lemon aromas on this concentrated Riesling. Ripe, juicy tangerine flavors lend sweetness to the palate, but are cut with a vein of lime acidity that reverberates from start to finish. It's delicately textured, yet chock full of vibe and zest.
Toasty, oaky aromas of popcorn and modest fruits set up an elegant feeling palate with a mild but present bubble bead. Apple, nectarine and citrus flavors finish long and pure, with a dry, citrusy feel.
Full of cherry and banana freshness, this is a simple wine that shows attractive fruit and acidity. It is good to go now, light, fragrant and bright.
A firmly tannic wine that has a core of dryness surrounded by blackberry juice fruits. The acidity is tamed but present, fitting well with the solid center. For possible aging over 2–3 years.
A sweet smell of honeysuckle and grapefruit candy permeates the nose of this bottling, along with cut honeydew melon and apple blossom. Sugary mandarin juice is the primary flavor on the palate, but it's properly offset by acidity a chalky texture.
This pleasant effort is light and cherry-flavored. It shows little evidence of any barrel flavors despite aging in 100% French oak. The tannins stiffen up and give it a bit of backbone.
The wood presence here is so strong, it all but eclipses the natural fruit of this wine. The style shows a thinner more compact approach and it's almost as if the wine doesn't have the pulp or fruit to stand up to all that oak.
This blend of 46% Cabernet Sauvignon, 24% Malbec, 18% Merlot and 12% Cabernet Franc, brings barrel aromas of cocoa and chocolate that complement the cherry and plum notes. The flavors are soft and supple with some firmness to the tannins that still need some time to soften.
91-93. Barrel sample. This wine's concentrated tannins match the sweet fruit and ripe acidity. It shows structure and density, with its blackberry flavor already showing well.
A blend of equal parts Sangiovese, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, this opens with aromas of mature plum, blackberry, mint, spice and underbrush. The palate delivers espresso, mocha, toasted oak, licorice and dried blackberry alongside firm tannins.
The best Mosel Rieslings of the difficult 2013 vintage all juxtapose plump, luscious yellow fruit against spine-tingling acidity. Dancing and delicate, this is a classic example of the style. It seems demure in stature, yet packs a punch of complexity and flavor from start to finish.
This is likely the most ageworthy Shiraz winemaker John Duval has crafted since leaving Penfolds. The oak is subtle, the fruit still tight. It's full bodied but bursting with potential, shown in hints of black cherries and plums, mocha and mint. The finish is long, mouthwatering and softly dusty in texture, making it luscious yet firm. Drink 2018–2030.
Grassy and herbal, this might easily be mistaken for Sauvignon Blanc. There's plenty of acid evident, with lemony fruit that finishes short and tart.
Clearly from a cool climate, dominated by tomato, mushroom and herb flavors just breaking into black cherry. Dry, with great acidity and complex tannins. This is a subtle Pinot that will appeal to tasters who enjoy thinking about what's in their mouth. Editors' Choice.
Opens in a soft, dusty, melony way, with cider-like flavors, melon and dryness as opposed to chiseled zest. Satisfying but on the bland side, with cider on the finish. Good for casual consumption but unexciting.
This ripe offering opens with aromas of lightly stewed black fruits and baked beans. In the mouth, it's chewy and rich, with a syrupy leaning. Flavors of oak-based hickory, toast and savory spices accent blackberry fruit, while the finish is toasty, peppery and dark in character. Drink through 2017.
Smells a little jumbled out of the chute, but in no time it rounds into form. The nose turns out to be rich, jammy and convincing, while the palate is robust and features ripe plum and berry flavors. For bold fruit, vigor and drive, this answers the call. It could probably stand to be more elegant and nuanced, but as is it's a fine mix of Carmenère, Cabernet and Syrah.
This appellation blend from Bryan Babcock is flamboyant on the nose, showing lime blossom, honeysuckle, wet cement and peach aromas. There's a great sizzle of acidity and pithy grip to the palate, supporting its strong stone fruit flavors.
With a rich spiciness and flavors of wild berry and currant, this is an excellent example of Sonoma County Zinfandel. It's robust and potent in alcohol, showing the variety's rustic nature at its best. It will partner well with stews and barbecue.
There's a playful candy-like element to the nose that recalls butterscotch, caramel or honey drops. Beyond those aromas are citrus, stone fruit and melon. This is a lighter, less dense expression of Friulano with a crisp, zippy close.
In this 2012 reserve, the fruit is sourced entirely from the Black Family estate vineyard. It's got medium concentration with cherry fruit the focus, enhanced with flavors of cola and truffle. Still quite young, the wine feels slightly disjointed; a second bottle was similar. Give this one additional bottle age.
A blend of half Sémillon and half Chardonnay, this is an aromatic, fully fleshed-out wine that veers into richness without going too far. Swirling in layers of concentrated pear and lemon, it provides a long, substantial finish, ending in balanced acidity.
From 100% grand cru Chardonnay vineyards in the Côte des Blancs, this is a rich but almost bone-dry wine. It has a great mineral character that offers freshness, apple skins and a flinty edge. The disgorgement date is indicated on the bottle. Impressive, this would benefit from six months' aging.

This crisp, lightweight Pinot Noir could easily go with salmon or chicken. Its peppery, pie-cherry and currant fruit and spicy, tangy finish would make it a refreshing choice in warmer weather.
This is a densely tannic wine, very ripe and concentrated. It is perfumed, rich, and blackberry fruited, showing the character of Touriga Nacional, but in an exaggerated form. Age the wine for at least two more years.
This dessert blend of 66% Zinfandel, 21% Carignane, 8% Syrah and 5% Mourvèdre begins with a pruney and alcohol-laden nose, but then peppercorn, clove, Indian spice and plum skin aromas emerge.

It's soft in the mouth, verging on flabby, but has some charming flavors of apple and spiced pear that make it enjoyable as a chilled apéritif. Drink now.

Beautiful wine, lush and soft in the style of this warm vintage. It's immediately enjoyable for the wealth of cherries, blackberries and raspberries, with a decadent edge of melted milk chocolate. Oak adds extra dimensions of smoky vanilla, caramel, butterscotch and gingerbread. Those who think they don't like red wine will enjoy. Hard to tell if it has the stuffing for the long haul, but it's gorgeous now and for the next six years.
A good, simple Carmenère with burnt rubber and crusty fruit aromas sitting in front of young, rubbery cassis and berry flavors. Not a whole lot of the variety's herbal, saucy side; instead it's a short, clean wine that's fresh and easy to drink.
This is a pleasantly fruity wine, with tangy cherry fruit limned with some herbal, earthy tannins. Hints of tobacco and vanilla are there, but the wine quickly shows rather harsh, chalky acids that descend into a bitter, herbal finish.

A nicely balanced Barossa Shiraz, the 2008 The Watcher avoids any sense of raisining or overripeness that may sometimes be found in wines from this vintage. Plum and savory notes are complemented by subtle oaking, and the overall impression is of ripe, creamy-textured fruit balanced by crisp acids. Drink now–2018.

Now perfectly mature, this ripe, spicy wine is delicious. It shows a fine balance between botrytis, fruit and acidity, keeping it at once crisp and richly sweet. Ready to drink.
A little dull and disappointing given this winery's excellent track record with Pinot Gris, this wine may reflect the difficult, wet 2007 vintage. It's crisp and balanced, but does not show the ripe fruit flavors of previous vintages. Tart green berries, green apple and grapefruit flavors dominate, bone dry and high acid. A slightly metallic note creeps into the finish.
Chunky on the nose, but also sort of rubbery, brambly, pickled and leathery. The palate is stretched and strained, with wiry acidity and piercing tannins supporting rubbery black fruit flavors. Grabby, tannic and a little hot on the finish. Good but on the sharp, underwhelming side.

We first tasted this wine back in March 2008, and it seems to have aged quite a bit since then. Stewed strawberry and rhubarb along with sanguine notes on the nose, followed by riper flavors of fig preserves and spice in the mouth and finish. Good acidity and softened tannins make this wine a good choice to drink now.
Salty is not a common descriptor for Pinot Gris, but appropriate here. Crisp apple, Asian pear, unripe peach, a dusting of cinnamon, and some slightly bitter skin flavors combine here; the acids rule.

Honeydew and lychee aromas abound on this very pretty wine. A bit of spice offsets delicate sweetness, and a strike of lemon-lime acidity shines through the finish.

Great acidity and minerality in this elegant young wine. Doesn't show the rich concentration of De Loach's single-vineyard Chards, but then again, it costs far less. It's actually a good value for a dry, minerally and complex Russian River Chardonnay. Don't drink it too cold.
This blend of Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon, which is only sold in Bermuda, shows the tang of anise alongside cranberry, dried oregano and pencil lead on the nose. The palate's boysenberry fruit is leveled with black pepper, roasting herbs and a long finish that's quite intriguing.
This is fresh and lively, with a black cherry core accented by hints of nutmeg, mint, carob and fig. It has both elegance and structure. Pair this with meat-filled ravioli or seasoned cheeses.
Tasting of white grapes, this is fruity, lightly spicy and fragrant. It's a rare grape in Alsace which is a shame because its delicate, attractive fruitiness makes it a great apéritif wine.
An unusual find of an old vintage currently available, this is certainly a mature wine. In fact, it is beginning to dry out—focused on old tannins rather than on the wonderful secondary flavors of a well-aged Bordeaux. For lovers of older wines, this is a bargain curiosity.
A fruity, light take on Cabernet Franc, this shows melon and strawberry flavors galore. It opens broadly and full across the palate, with pleasing freshness. Best served lightly chilled, as an opening course (and not too heavy) red.
A relatively simple, fruity wine that boasts melon and pineapple flavors and aromas. It's medium in body and pleasantly tart and citrusy on the finish, just lacks complexity. Drink now.

This debut blend somehow reaches 15% alcohol, not easy to do with Yakima Valley Sangiovese. It's a solid effort, which opens well—supple and polished, with pretty flavors of mixed plum and berry. It's silky, smooth and there's plenty of tangy fruit. The finish gets a little too hot, but that's a minor quibble in a wine that gives you this much flavor at this price. The finish keeps getting more and more interesting, piling on smoked ham and spicy clove as it goes.

There's something beautifully unique about this Prosecco that is best described as a dusty, chalky, mineral—almost salty—element. An organic wine that begs for dishes with sweet cream or cheese. Imported by Chartrand Imports.
Lusty and full-bodied, this dark-colored wine is deep in red, blue and black berry-cherry flavors, with additional complexities of milk chocolate, licorice, coconut macaroon and Kahlúa. Best of all is the structure that frames all this richness. The acid-tannin balance is polished and complex.

Oaky and smoky, this Cab is perfumed and intensely tannic with a bitter coffee-like finish.

Having earned its reputation as one of Australia's finest Chardonnays, the challenge is then to maintain that level of quality. The 2010 Art Series certainly does that.

It's full bodied, yet with great focus and length, ending crisply despite the wine's inherent richness. Drink now–2020, perhaps longer.

Loaded with pepper, hard spice and leather, but there's also plenty of bursting red fruit to this traditional Brunello. With every minute it's open the wine evolves: At first it's sweet and forward, but with time it turns earthy and leathery, and ultimately it gets very tight and brooding. Full acids, hammer-like tannins and major-league structure say hold for a minimum of six more years.
92-94 Very rich in character. The sweetness is there, but masked by the firm structure, the almost tannic texture. Great concentration.
There's no escaping the asparagus and canned bean aromas that consume the bouquet, but those scents do fade after a while and the nose eventually leads to flavors of lime, white peach and citrus. The zest and balance are good, and the vegetal character becomes less austere with time; but all along the way the wine carries that love-it-or-hate-it snap of green.
Pure Pinot Meunier from a select parcel of vines called La Grosse Pierre, this impressive limited-production bottling is an anomaly in Champagne. It fits Huré's crisp style yet also has rich fruitiness and generous acidity. Drink now.
Soft, supple plum envelopes an oaky structure in this Cabernet, supported by 15% Merlot. Coffee and chocolate complete the picture, finishing strong at the end, resulting in a value-priced wine of attractive flavor and immediate accessibility.
87-89 Barrel sample. Solid, foursquare, chunky wine that packs a punch of tannin, the fruit rather reticent.
84-86 Barrel sample. With its gentle tannins and juicy fruit, this is on the fresh side, the jelly and blackcurrant flavors a hint.
If you don't mind a touch of herbal pickle and rhubarb on both the bouquet and palate, then this inexpensive Carmenère will do the job. It offers modest red plum and herbal flavors with a bit of tartness and spice. Has good texture and overall balance.
Fresh and refined, this has an intensely fruity nose of wild berry, forest floor, pine and rose petal. The bright palate doles out crushed strawberry, Morello cherry, vanilla and cinnamon alongside smooth, supple tannins and bright acidity. Nicely balanced and focused. Drink through 2025.
With a blend that's dominated by 75% Touriga Nacional, this wine is superrich, perfumed and dense with tannins as well as fresher fruit. Black berries and dark plums push through the dry core that is solid and needing to age. This is a very fine wine which will be ready to drink from 2018.
Not a cookie-cutter wine, this tastes very alive and exuberant. It offers an aroma like fresh-baked scones, with very tangy flavors like orange and pineapple. That also makes it lively in texture, with lots of bright acidity derived from the grapes. Slightly nutty nuances develop on the finish, which is exceptionally long. It's a rare wine that has no added sulfites.
Here's a plump, juicy rosé from Tuscany with a pretty palette of aromas that goes from wild berries to pink flower. There's a touch of ash or white mineral at the back and the wine tastes generous and full in the mouth. It has intensity, personality and staying power.
Deserves its high score by virtue of power and sheer flamboyant dazzle. Packed with ripe, sweet cherries and milk chocolate, with a decadently meaty taste, like beef tartare. Oak plays the usual role, adding a caramelly, buttered toast richness. The tannins are brilliant, so soft and sweet, they're like candy. Drink this flashy wine over the next six years.
Underbrush, dark spice, mature berry and balsamic notes emerge in the glass. The chewy palate doles out juicy Marasca cherry, black raspberry and licorice flavors with a hint of pipe tobacco, while youthfully firm, seasoned tannins provide the framework. Drink 2019–2017.
Light in color, with transparency, something you usually don't see with Malbec. The nose is rubbery, saucy and a touch grassy, while the palate is tannic and grabby, with stewy, rustic, roasted berry flavors. Finishes with the taste of barbecue sauce.
Simple, with fruit punch-sweet pineapple and lemon flavors. High acidity makes it a little sour.
A Marsanne- and Roussanne-dominated blend, this is ripe and honeyed—almost to the point of raising questions about its residual sugar levels. But coproprietor François Alary says it's only 3g/L. Tastes like a mostly dry rendition of superripe oranges drizzled with honey, balanced by decent acidity and a sense of minerality. Spicy on the finish.
Lots of acidity gives this Chardonnay a real bite, while the fruit is very ripe, expressive of pineapples, tangerines and Meyer lemons. The result is a flavor of sour yellow candy, enriched with the creaminess of lees and a buttered toast note from the oak barrels. Drink with rich, buttery shellfish entrées.
This wine smells immediately fresh and tart, with scents of green plum, gooseberry, hard nectarine and straw filling the nose. The leanness continues in the mouth with citrus flavors leading thorough to the clean but lingering finish.
This wonderful wine showcases the blender's art. The grapes come from 11 appellations throughout the valley, and the wine, while notable for its delicious flavors, also is great in structure. It has soft tannins and refreshing acidity, and is entirely dry, with moderate alcohol. Those flavors include raspberry jam, cherry-vanilla cream, cinnamon and white pepper. So easy to like.
The aroma is all spice. To taste, there's plenty of spice as well, but the fruit is almost extravagant in its sweetness, vibrancy and very forward character. Too much? No, it all works, and it's totally drinkable.
The vineyard is in the Petaluma Gap, a wind tunnel you'll be hearing more about as the source of cool-climate wines. This lusty Syrah is enormously fruit-forward in cherries, blackberries, coffee, beef carpaccio and peppery spice flavors, an exuberant wine balanced with crisp acids. Drink now through 2009.
Despite the reasonable price tag, this is a very good bottle of Cabernet, the kind that should be poured by the glass at your local steakhouse. The mixed berry and cedar flavors are easy to like, and it has enough crisp acidity and silky tannin to stand up to rare beef without being overly heavy or rich.
Foxy berry and currant flavors carry a note of wet dog fur. This is clampy and saucy feeling on the palate, with herbal flavors of plum, berry and tomato sauce. A hollow finish tastes slightly green.
Here's a soft, oak-driven expression of Syrah with ripe cherry, crushed black pepper and smoked bacon. Well-etched aromas of spice and chocolate bring up the rear and lend a soft, supple feel.
Whiffs of smoke and grain lend a savory bent to lemon and herb aromas on this full bodied, dry Riesling. Searing lemon-lime acidity and a minerally palate contribute to its lean, linear style.
The wine is fat and fruity, a bold statement of red berries that burst from the glass. It's fresh while also rich and structured. It's not going to age further, so drink now.
This wine is a blend of Sangiovese (52%), Cabernet Sauvignon (32%) and Syrah. Aromas of bittersweet chocolate, herb, pencil lead, smoke, cranberry and dark fruit lead to palate-coating black-fruit flavors that display depth and density. It shows a lovely sense of balance and detail.
Aromas of mint, talcum powder and dried cherry lead you to a delightful palate of red and black plums and black raspberries. Soft tannins and a persistent finish make this a notable Bulgarian Merlot.
The initial nosing reveals a char-broiled character along with maple. That nose turns even darker with airing, indicating that no barrel was spared in the making of this wine. The flavor profile is all dark berries and cream, with yet more wood at the heart. On the tail end, it's dry, broad and full of tannins and extract that coat the mouth. Best Buy.
Plump aromas of melon and almond candy announce a chunky palate with citric acidity. Pithy orange and melon flavors are straightforward, with some sweetness. Consider this a decent, generic white wine.
Not showing the richness of the fabulous 2005 vintage, but a very nice wine nonetheless. Bone dry and rich in citrusy acids, its flavors veer toward cherry skins, orange zest, cola, anise and pepper.
This is smooth and harmonious from the dark color, to the baritone aromas of black cherry and cassis, to the rather full body, rich texture and firm tannins. Not too big and not too oaky, but well balanced for its impressive breadth of flavor.
This is a gigantic wine made solidly in the modern cult Napa style of dazzling power. It's similar to the winery's 2005, although lacking some of its structure. Massive in blackberries, black currants and cedar flavors, with a pleasantly earthy edge of green olives and carob. Extremely fine, but wants some time in the cellar. Better after 2012.
This is an unfettered but very enjoyable Amarone, with upfront aromas of black fruit. The palate shows ripe but not exuberant plum and prune flavors, with a hint of chocolate. Pair with seasoned cheeses or braised meat dishes.
A pure and distinctive fruit flavor, like a blend of rhubarb and blackberry, distinguishes this full-bodied but elegant and velvet-textured wine. There is little or no new oak influence to get in the way of the melody of the grapes themselves. While the wine is lush and broad in mouthfeel, a nice boost of fine tannins and fresh acidity keep it lively.
A rare Marlborough Merlot, this is a superficially charming wine that shows cassis fruit and lashings of smoky, cedary oak. It does lack a bit of richness, particularly on the finish, but it scores for its upfront display of ripe fruit and toasty oak.
This Chardonnay isn't as oaky as the winery's more expensive estate bottling. Its barrel notes don't overwhelm the wine, allowing bright citrus, tropical fruit and peach flavors to show through. The palate is accented with brisk acidity.
Aromas of white peach, honeysuckle and butterscotch are clean but quite plump on the nose of this widely available bottling. Tons of ripe stone fruit show on the palate, along with juicy apples and warm melons, cut by only the slightest acidity.
Opulent and floral, with pressed rose and blue violets. Soapy aromas with church incense and cinnamon potpourri. Very enduring and intense with tight, firm tannins and good length.
This is well balanced, ripe and with a good link between the structure and the fragrant, perfumed red berries. The wine is full of fruit and acidity while having a core of dark tannins that will allow it to age. It will be best drunk after 2018.
Inspired by the Italian word for pearl, La Perlara is a delicious dessert wine that boasts a luminous golden color and intense aromas of honey, almond, apricot and sweet yellow rose. There's also a touch of piquant spice at the end that sets it apart, and the mouthfeel is indeed as smooth and silky as a pearl.
Full, rich wine, both fruity and ripely textured. The wine has weight and concentrated red fruits, with a touch of citrus. Typically dry, its richness makes it seem soft, rounded and for food.
While a bit lean in concentration, yellow apple, pear and lemon are pristine and ripe on the nose and palate. The mouthfeel is a bit broad and flat but finishes briskly. Drink now.
Petite Sirah remains a curiosity in Oregon, and at such a low level of ripeness, this turns generic. Tart cranberry fruit remains herbal and thin as it hits a quick finish. The wine is well made, but lacks varietal punch and authenticity.
Named after the dry wind that blows through the Jurançon vineyards, this light, poised sweet wine has typical freshness, the botrytis never cloying but immersed in currants, fresh apricots. The wine has a lively, buoyant, sweet character.
Minty cedar and red raspberry jam provide a freshness to this medium-built wine, subtle in spice and made in a soft, approachable style. Cherry and cinnamon round out the lengthy finish.
A minerally textured wine, this layers tannins and a dark, brooding character over the ripe black fruits. It has considerable power and richness, with intensity of fruit and spice, and a sweet, almost soft finish.
Few Sicilian producers export 100% Perricone wines to the U.S. Among those who do, Firriato's Ribeca is among the best. This is a bold, concentrated and modern wine, with opulent chocolate and dark berry aromas framed by oak spice and vanilla. Keep it in your cellar for a few more years.
Offers plenty of citrus, spanning the spectrum from lime to orange and tangerine, with just a hint of nectarine mixed in. At 8.5% alcohol, this kabinett gives an impression close to dryness, and despite despite relatively soft acids on the finish, it's nicely balanced.
Light in color and more neutral and clean smelling than anything. The palate is airy and offers simple, pleasant melon and pear flavors. About as easygoing as they come; a no-frills white wine that's tasty, lightweight and a bit sweet.
Easy, fresh citrus aromas of tangerine and lemon blossom characterize the bouquet at first. As this crisp white wine warms and evolves in the glass, it releases mature tones of melon and apricot.
Round and weighty, this is a well-made Pinot Gris in a soft, slightly sweet style. Baked apple flavors pick up hints of cinnamon and caramel, accented by a squeeze of citrus.
Hints of brine and sea water lend rusticity to pressed-apple flavors in this dry, delicately framed wine. Fruit flavors seem rather oxidized on the palate, but a tart, lemony zing adds some freshness.
Sharp acidity and less-than-ripe green flavors are found in this Syrah, which was blended with a little Grenache. Notes of sour blackberry and cherry candy also surface, and it finishes bone dry.
Big, rich and complex, this is a Cabernet you want to lay down. Tasted in the late Fall of 2013, it's tannic, oaky and dry, brimming with spectacularly ripe blackberry, cherry and cassis flavors. The alcohol is a bit high, giving the wine some heat, and yet the balance is so good that the wine should easily develop over the next eight years.
Exuberant raspberry and cherry notes scent this dusty pink rosé. While brisk and dry on the palate, it's juicy and mouth-quenching with ripe white peach and red berry flavors. It finishes minerally with lingering salinity.
Tastes as sweet as raspberry or cherry jam, with a cut of citrusy acidity. This rustic wine also has some firm, furry tannins.
Alexandria Nicole's Shepherds Mark is a Rhône blend of Roussanne, Marsanne and Viognier, sourced from the Destiny Ridge (estate) vineyard. Barrel fermented in neutral oak, it presents an inviting floral blossom nose, leading into a delicious mix of citrus, white peach, melon and light tropical fruits. It's rich but never tiring.
87-89 Barrel sample. Initially closed, the wine is tight, mineral, with tannins that are hard and dense. The fruit is perhaps too light for all this weight of structure.
This 60-40 blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet is a plush, modern wine with thick layers of cherry, spice, tobacco and lingering nuances of ripe fruit.
This seems to be a little on the watery side; it does not have the floral highlights that Chenin can sometimes show, nor the fruit concentration that would elevate the score. It's clean and quaffable, with very light citrus and apple fruit flavors.
An aromatic opening of raisin and prune is a clarion announcement that this is on the overripe side. The mouthfeel, which is heavy and chunky but also fruity, is confirmation of the wine's ripeness level. Flavors of baked plum, raisin and chocolate finish deep and raisiny.
Refreshing flowers and fruit lead on the nose of this impressive Chardonnay, followed by flavors of flowers, layered fruit and a clean, acidic edge. The wine has class and character and is a perfect food-pairing choice.
Fermented with 30% new American oak, it's direct and appealing with notes of melted caramel, vanilla, and toast. The flavors are rich and medium bodied, finishing a bit short.
Sweet oak and jammy fruit dominate this Chardonnay. Made in the popular style, its buttered toast, orange marmalade and honey flavors—all brightened with acidity—will find widespread appeal.
This plump, ripe Malbec is aggressive and jumpy on the nose, but the flavors of blackberries and chocolate are pure and positively represent what Argentina can do with value-priced Malbec. If you're not expecting miracles, this thick, textured wine may just win you over.
Made from organically grown grapes, this Chardonnay imparts a taste of beeswax and lemon. It's robust in acidity and structured with a sizeable finish. Small percentages of Muscat, Viognier and Riesling are mingled in.
Celery, lettuce and lime aromas are cool and green. This is showing tangy, snappy acidity in support of lime, tarragon, sage and scallion flavors. A fresh, racy finish is fitting.
Despite its name, Zwei also has Blaufränkisch in its blend. It's lean, rather austere and structured with a hard edge. There is black currant acidity, toasty wood and a green finish. Not for aging. Screwcap.
This bottling blends 60% Monterey County, 23% Santa Barbara County and 17% Sonoma County fruit to deliver bright and juicy berries on the nose, from strawberry to blackberry as well as graphite and tree bark. The flavors are very full, with more berries and star anise, although the texture is somewhat simple.
Stony polished white-fruit aromas are lean and clean. This brut nature shows modest heft as it expands on the palate, but mostly this is racy and fit. Yeasty flavors of white pepper and lime finish with a leesy note and stoniness.
Dark in color, and too heavy in weight for a rosé. And it's not clearly dry, as the label says. The cherry and vanilla flavors have a sweet finish.
A lean Zin, with lots of minty acidity and not much fruit. There are traces of blackberries, bitter espresso and plums.
Pleasing aromatics send up a mix of cherry, black tea and clean earth. The wine is tannic and substantial, with ripe black cherry fruit and a streak of caramel.
This serious, solid wine has plenty of smoky flavors, juicy black fruit and a firm background of tannins. Ripe, full of fruit and with fine acidity at the end, it will be ready from 2019.
An appealing nose of blackberry, plum and cinnamon gives this Lebanese red a sturdy start. Flavors of berry, spicebox and pepper follow, and balanced acids give it food friendly appeal. Not terribly complex, but definitely likeable.
This is not a showy wine, but the sense of reserve, good acidity, fresh flavors and good balance form an enjoyable picture that will be versatile with food.
Winemaker James MacPhail continues to refine his solo project with this Annapolis-sourced effort, a smooth layered expression of baked strawberry and rose petal herbaceousness. Lingering fruitiness makes it lovely to enjoy, as the oak remains a background player in full support of the succulence and ripe power. Still young, it should continue to open further over time.
Who else besides L'Ecole makes three different Semillons? Bravo for showing that this much-maligned grape can be made in a wide variety of styles, and can blossom if given the superstar treatment usually reserved for Chardonnay. This low-priced version emphasizes fruit and spice to good effect. It's clean, bracing and refreshing, and showcases citrus/mineral flavors in a tight, concise style.
Made in the sweet, German style, this dessert Riesling opens with honeyed apricot, tangerine and vanilla aromas, then turns soft, sweet and a little one-dimensional. The flavors follow the aromas.
Lots of juicy cherry, black raspberry, vanilla and smoky flavors in this soft wine, but it struggles to rise above simplicity. Would benefit from blending with harder, darker, more tannic varieties, like Syrah or Petite Sirah.
This wine starts with typical Pinot Gris aromas of apple, pear and ginger, then picks up some citrusy flavors on the palate before ending on a note of orange zest. It's medium in weight, with a dry, silky feel as it glides across the palate.
Mantonico is among the most cherished native grape varieties of southern Italy, and this luminous expression by celebrated Calabria producer Librandi offers an interesting mix of elegance and power. The wine boasts thick natural density and there's a bright note of zesty spice on the close.
Made with southern Italy's most noble white grape, this structured wine conveys subtle aromas of white and yellow spring flowers accented by whiffs of beeswax and slate. The juicy palate delivers white peach, cantaloupe, pink grapefruit and mineral alongside fresh acidity.
This bright Grillo opens with a light golden color, with fresh aromas of cut grass, citrus and stone fruit. The mouthfeel is simple, crisp and sharp.
Honey-sweet in orange and vanilla flavors, this wine has a good backbone of acidity that makes it crisp and clean. Drink it with vanilla desserts or even cheesecake.
With low alcohol and a clean minerality, this Pinot represents the new direction that the variety is taking in California, helped by cooler vintages. It's dry, crisply acidic and complex, with the cherry-berry flavors assisted with notes of earthy herb and mushroom. A lovely wine now, and should gently develop over the next six years.
While the nose of this purplish red is almost closed, the palate conveys lots of pepper-spiced black cherry tamed by slight but pleasantly textured tannins that lend slender structure. There is freshness, balance and verve in this unusual blend of Austrian everyman Zweigelt and silky Pinot Noir. An intriguing blend that keeps you coming back for more.
Light wine, showing some citrus along with green fruit skin structure, this is balanced and crisp. The fruits take a while to open out, then give a rounded, soft palate, leaving a green apple and toast finish.
Aside from some hints of garlic on the nose, this is a clean, somewhat light Sauvignon with ripe melon and fig flavors. Picks up notes of citrus zest on the palate, turning tangy and spicy on the finish.
This is a tiny production Charbono that's light and in balance, with flavors and aromas of raspberry, red cherry and mushrooms right out of the dirt.
This is a full-force wine with a scratchy bouquet and aromas of herbal fruit, vanilla and burnt stems. It's jumpy in the mouth, and not that smooth, with aggressive tannins and baked flavors of raisin, herbs and burnt fruit. On the finish, there's oaky caramel and chocolate along with heat and stewy notes.
Light in color and aromas, with hints of herbal tea and dry spices. Not a lot of fruit or body throughout, but shows candied cherry and raspberry fruit and a dusting of cocoa. Dry, toasty and simple on the finish.
Highly perfumed, this exotic wine has a strongly textured, scented character that masks the fruit. Red berries underlie the dry texture along with acidity, giving the wine a fresh and fruity aftertaste.
A new joint venture between winemaker Jorge Moreira and owner the Bergqvist family, both of Quinta de la Rosa. The vineyard is in the remote Douro Superior. You can certainly smell the dry heat in this young wine. To taste it has a Port-like smoothness overlying its dry tannins. The fruit is sweet, succulent, layered with blackberry jam and dark berries.
Soft and fruity, with pie-filling blackberry, cherry and raspberry flavors, accented with smoky oak. Dry, and drinkable now.
There is an attractive orange-zest tang to this rounded wine. It brings out ripe yellow fruits that have acidity to add to the mineral texture of this balanced wine. It is ready to drink.
Bruised strawberries and ripe red plums are leveled by iron, ginger snaps, crushed slate and soy on the umami-laden nose of this bottling by Winemaker Jonathan Nagy. Intriguing river--stone minerality powers the palate, where black plums and olallieberries meet with black spice and lots of florality.
This is beautifully bottled and priced for loftiness, but this reviewer finds the wine to be fiery, ultra acidic and just not that pleasurable. Cheesy aromas set up a palate with blazing acidity. That leads to sourness that adorns flavors of salt and peanuts. Despite the fancy packaging, this doesn't come across as anything better than good.
This has a charming nose that boasts rose, violet and red berry while the juicy, easy-drinking palate offers ripe wild cherry, chopped mint, white pepper and a hint of star anise. There isn't much complexity but it is savory and balanced, with fresh acidity and supple tannins.
Hailing from the very hot 2003 vintage, this wine is baked and full, with mature yet rich aromas. It feels thorough and weighty, with sweet berry flavors that are at their peak along with a chocolate note. This is warm, full and under control on the finish. Drink now.
Crisp and freshly simple Riesling. There are attractive green fruits, good acidity and a bright perfumed  aftertaste. Not for aging.
A fruit-driven style, with cherry and raspberry notes accented by hints of chocolate and coffee. It's ripe and creamy on the midpalate, just fading a little too quickly on the finish. Drink now–2013.
This simple, no-fuss Prosecco opens with cheery aromas of peach, yellow rose and a touch of bitter almond. This expression also offers mature flavors of melon and apricot on the finish.
This is another soft, mature red wine from this Columbia Gorge winery, but without the weight or definition of the Merlot and the Cabernet. It's simple and light, and quickly thins out in the mouth.
A light touch of caramel sweetens the otherwise bright and crisp fruit. It has a rich character that is ripe and packed with red berry and citrus flavors. With its great fruitiness, this is an apéritif style of wine.
As before, the new vintage of Chatter Creek Viognier treats you immediately to bracingly fresh scents of peach, apricot and ripe melon. Tart and leesy, immaculately clean, it starts with crisp, slightly bitter notes of lime and citrus, then fans out, adding a creamy texture to the mid-palate. This is a moderate 13.5% alcohol, rare in Washington Viognier.
Yes, this wine is tannic. To begin with it seems austere and mineral. But then the substrate of black berry juice asserts itself. The fruits are fresh rather than sweet, combining with leather, spice and a presence of new wood. Typical of Montrose, it is hard to appreciate this young, with those tannins needing to open out. But wait 10 years.
To date, Godelia has done better with its Mencía than Godello. This wine smells like pine, wheat and match stick, all aromas related to underripe fruit. A stalky, corny flavor profile lacks ripeness, a theme that's replayed on the finish.
On first sniff, this shows Viognier's lean side, offering notes of kiwis and lemons. Letting the wine sit in the glass helps to lure out the grape's characteristic scents of exotic flowers, apricots and peaches. A fresh, easygoing selection, this concludes with a clean, medium-length finish.
An excellent vintage for Il Grifone, which is a blend of 80% Montepulciano and 20% Cab Sauvignon. The nose is slightly leathery, with hints of crude oil, dark berry and toast. It's tight in the mouth, but serious, with tannins as well as ripe, complex plum and berry flavors. Should be great with grilled meats and the like. Imported by Empson (USA) Ltd.
Subdued lemon and forest fruit back up the bright, blush colour of this fruitful, almost fleshy rosé. While this is an easy-drinking party wine, it nonetheless finishes with real freshness and leaves you utterly quenched.
With low alcohol and a sweet finish, this pleasant wine is packed with juicy flavors of tropical fruits such as pineapples, papayas and golden mangoes. It has a rich vein of wild honey that persists into the finish.
Dense and beautifully concentrated, this nicely aged, 100% Merlot opens with round plum, cassis and black cherry fruit, a blend of Klipsun, Boushey, Clifton and Alder Ridge grapes, from four different AVAs. Its long, thick tannins extend the palate impression and the nicely melded fruit and barrel flavors linger beautifully, suggesting a good 6–8 years of life ahead.
Beautiful and evocative, this sensuous Dolcetto sends up beguiling aromas of dried cherry, tobacco, plum, fig and balsamic, with flavors to follow. Tart and mouthfilling, it shows real varietal character and strength, with a persistent and stylish finish.
Creamy, rich and spicy, this has potent pineapple- and orange-jam flavors, with lots of the sweetly buttered toast you get from oak barrel aging. It seems a little sweet in the finish, but it's elegant and refined.
Tobacco and black cherry flavors drink dry, in a simple, rather rough texture that closes with a scour of tannins. Good with tomato sauce and cheese.
This boldly flavored and deeply colored wine has aromas of dried herb, wood ash and anise. Flavors convey ripe black cherry, dried plum and black pepper, while the texture is quite firm from tannins and acidity. The wine is full in body and assertive in flavor.
Dark in color, a bright red plum and fresh berry wine, the fruit flavors layered over a significant toast element. The wood gives the tannin, but the wine is already coming together, offering some of the proper Volnay velvet texture.
Silky, with pronounced tannins that should mellow in time, this is an earthy, stemmy and perfumed wine. Succulent and balanced, it's brightly exuberant in black cherry yet brooding and complex throughout, changing slightly from savory to floral and back again. It's an incredible wine out of the gate; cellar with confidence, through 2021.
A young wine that smells and tastes as though it leapt from the fermenter to the glass. It's packed with jammy, ripe fruit and the high acidity that usually accompanies it. Juicy and thick, it's almost rude in its impertinence. But it's fun, and the price is right. Best Buy.
This is a sanguine, full-bodied and nearly jammy wine, rich and plush in black and red fruit and a curious twist of beef jerky. Cedar and cranberry provide a crisper, more classical edge burnished on the palate in leathery black pepper.
After a couple of rough years, all Fluminus needed was the good 2004 vintage. And the result is splendid. This blend of Cab, Garnacha and Carignan is pure as can be, with polished leather and fine tobacco aromas entering the fray. The whole is complete and big-boned, but in the end it's more tight and compact than plush. Give it two years to show its best side.
Mid-gold color. Pronounced aromas of ripe yellow fruits, honey, with hints of warm earth, savory fresh root vegetables and spice. Sweet, richly textured, but refreshingly crisp. Vibrant flavors follow through on the palate showing strong mineral notes. Broad but firm palate and a long lingering lively finish.
For a first vintage out of northerly Limarí Valley, this Concha y Toro effort from winemaker Marcelo Papa exceeds any reasonable expectations. It's an exotic, unique version of perfectly ripe, healthy Syrah from a perfect Chilean vintage. It steamrolls with maxed-out wild berry fruit, a saturated feel and backbone. Enjoy now and over the next few years.
This perfumed wine is tough on the palate. It has a firm, dry core, surrounded by red-currant-driven acidity. The finish is out of balance.
From a Charlie Chenoweth-farmed site, this wine is vividly marked by earth and mushroom with bolts of cherry and cranberry. Bright acidity complements a firmness of tannin and texture that flirts with being leathery, the finish all about cola spice.
Big, muscular and herbal, with olive, spice and driving black fruit aromas. The acidity is high-toned and elevated, so the palate is jumpy and electric, with raspberry and currant flavors. Delivers a jolt and tang, but overall the flavors and harmony are good.
The nose has warm, jammy aromas that suggest horsehide and blackberry syrup. It feels chunky and full, with jammy, spicy, slightly herbal flavors of black fruits. On the finish, it turns more herbal and loses its structure.
A wonderfully balanced, rich Zin. It's ripe, fruity and spicy, offering powerful flavors of sweet berry jam, chocolate, licorice, bacon, vanilla bean, black pepper and sandalwood. The alcohol is high, but if it wasn't, this Zin wouldn't be as good.
This is a great example of what more inexpensive Bordeaux could be like with proper care in the vineyards and winery. Scents of chocolate, dried herbs and cassis ease into similar flavors, carried on a medium-weight, slightly creamy palate. Turns spicy and firmer on the finish, suggesting it will last until 2010 or so.
This new release from Mumm is a selection from 12 of the best vineyards owned or run by the company. It is certainly a complex wine, finely balanced with layers of intense, mature fruits, very mineral in structure, and with the crispness of the acidity acting as a support to the citrus and vanilla flavors. Worth aging for another 4–5 years.
Violet, cigar box and smoke mark the nose of this distinctive Xinomavro. On the plate, spice, sweet cedar and clove give it a rustic but refined feel. Pair with aged cheeses or meat dishes for extra appeal.
At first, the bright Bing cherry fruit carries suggestions of anise and mint, but in the mouth the wine does not deliver all that the nose promises. The tannins turn aggressively bitter. This falls short of the outstanding 2008.
Here is a well-focused wine with appealing toastiness as soon as it's opened. Fruit flavors are still tight, but unfold into tangy raspberry. It spent 18 months in half new French oak, to good effect.
This complex Syrah and  (with a little Zin) showcases both varieties at their western Paso Robles best. The Syrah is rich in dark berry-cherry and mocha flavors, while the Cabernet adds cassis and a nice tannic structure. I'm not sure what the 4 % of Zin brings, maybe a wild, peppery note. The final impression is of real class and distinction. Drink now and for the next few years.
Named for producer Charlie Heintz' mother, who once cared for the family ranch and vineyard, this salty, herbal wine opens exquisitely in Key lime pie and orange blossom. A nutty afternote follows the first set of flavors, all around a core of balanced minerality and oak, finishing with a bite of graham cracker.
Luscious, long, full-bodied and rich, a wonderful wine that showcases its appellation. Has well-ripened flavors of blackcurrants and cassis that drink long and deep, although there's some hollowness, which costs it a few points. The flavors are wrapped in soft, easy but complex tannins. Fully dry and nicely oaked, this wine is immediately enjoyable.
93-95 Barrel sample. A small property on one of the best sites in Saint-Emilion, newly released under its own name. It is powerful, dense compact, with dark tannins, an impressive richness. It is full, firm and solid.
This crisp, lemon-scented wine has a light texture and the freshest fruit. It comes with apricot and apple flavors. It is lively and bright and ready to drink.
Lime, fresh-cut grass, tangerine and other clean, pure aromas are the greeting. The palate is whimsical and offers good acidic cut; flavors of lime, green apple and chili peppers are correct and turn mildly pithy on the finish.
Wood tones of leather, spice and tobacco are folded within dark berry fruit, cassis and blue flower to create a well-rounded and balanced Roero Riserva. You still get those distinctively drying tannins on the close although this expression puts more emphasis on softness and succulence. A Marc de Grazia selection; various American importers.
A grassy hint of freshness accents this wine's ripe green and red apple-inflected nose. The palate is slightly dilute, but a touch of spritz and herbal spiciness make it fun and easy to drink. Fruit-driven and slender in body, it finishes refreshing and dry.
There's a good deal of complexity on this top bottling from this Gilroy-based producer, with chopped black olive, cola, cloves, thyme and dried lemon peel on the nose. It's expansive on the palate, with strawberry, leather, sour cranberry and chopped herb flavors.

A wine that combines richness with a great structure. It is ripe, smoky, the red fruits rich and concentrated. A wine that is packed with juicy fruit and also with a good aging potential.
Floral and fresh smelling, with rosy notes, blueberry and nary any funk, leather or earth. Vibrant and juicy in the mouth, with boysenberry and plum flavors that set up a fruity, clean finish. Brighter, smoother and easier going than the 2009.
Sure, cedar and chocolate are the dominant aromas and flavors, but there's enough blueberry fruit to stand up to the oak rather nicely. It doesn't hurt that the oak is high-quality stuff either, as the elements blend together in a harmonious whole. A little oaky, but shows a degree of finesse not often found in Chilean wines at this level.
With a sizable presence on the nose and a palate evocative of black cherry, strawberry compote and orange peel, this wine speaks volumes in terms of texture and body. Its full-bodied concentration is supported by generous oak. Despite all that power, the tannins remain demure and relatively well behaved.

There's more than a whiff of eucalyptus, olive and herb aromas on the nose, but there's also a dry berry hint underneath. It hits with hard acids and tannins but settles, while cherry and plum flavors come across herbal and dry. A sinewy blend of 50% Syrah, 30% Carignan and 20% Malbec.
Stark lime and lime pith tones lend invigorating balance to this piercingly sweet mélange of tangerine, peach and melon flavors. It's gorgeously fruity but anchored by laser-like precision. Delicious now but should improve through 2030.
A light cherry-red color, this wine offers bright aromas of strawberry and cherry. It drinks off dry, with lightly spritzy fruit flavors that come off as a bit weighty and ponderous.
A festive, elegant Pinot for drinking  now with fine fare, such as lamb, steak, salmon or tuna. It's crisp, silky and dry, yet there's a core of ripe raspberry and cherry essence enriched with toasty oak.
Stiff and leathery, this 100% varietal Carmenère is barely ripe, with alcohol at 12.6% and green, stemmy tannins. The natural herbal character of the grape seems exaggerated, and the leathery finish shows no ripeness at all.

Overripe, with a raisiny edge and some sharp Port and coffee acidity to the blackberry flavors. Malolactic probably helped, as does new French oak, but it's still a sharp, disappointing wine.
Made with Zibibbo and Moscato grapes, this fortified wine offers heady aromas of mature apricot, candied lemon drop and a hint of thyme. The round, one-dimensional palate shows acacia honey and dried figs.
Viognier is a clear success story for Wilridge. This is not a flashy wine, and it goes down easily. It's deeply concentrated, with a rich core of peach, apricot and lemon drop flavors.
This tastes bold in flavor and feels lavish in texture. Aromas resemble red cherry, cinnamon and nutmeg, while the flavors are ripe and spread out on the palate, seeming to form layers of fruit, spice and maple. Smooth and flavorful, it's appealing from first sniff to finish.
Sharply green and minty, with tart flavors that just barely suggest cherries.

This charmer represents good value in the pricey Margaret River region. Try with roast lamb. Drink now or wait a year or two for more nuance.
Aromas of corn and underripe fruit dominate the nose, while the palate is broad and oaky, boasting notes of popcorn and white fruits. Good acidity from coastal vineyards gives it life, but overall it's woody and a bit vegetal.

From a boutique producer that shows great promise for the future, this fresh Falanghina opens with bright notes of green grass, kiwi, lemon and white flower. It's an easy, crisp wine that keeps the palate crystal clean.
This sweet, red, fortified wine is labeled as a tawny Port but was not made in Portugal, from where the original Port comes. It offers haunting aromas of cherry compote, molasses and cedar, while flavors suggest cherry sauce, caramel and roasted nuts. A mouth-clinging, thick texture extends the finish for minutes.
92-94. Barrel sample. This wine has both weight and a light touch. Its weight is driven by the powerful botrytis character and ripe apricot fruit; its lightness comes from a straight line of intense acidity that cuts through the wine. It should age a long time.
Muted aromatics tease on the nose before chewy texture and full-bodied weight enter the scene. Deceptively light and airy at first, the wine then delves into a hearty taste of marzipan and oak.

The warm climate of Gisborne, on New Zealand's North Island, isn't known for its Riesling, but this is a solid effort, as long as sweetness isn't an issue.

This 57-43 blend piquantly shows off the varietal characters of both grape varieties in its combination of citrus and pepper notes. It's like a collision of lime and jalapeño, but the wine's modest intensity makes it more of a fender-bender than an ambulance call, and the finish fades a little too quickly.
A very high-toned, wound-up nose slowly reveals chalky aromas, concentrated purple fruit and crushed violets on this bottling by the Daou brothers. The palate is also tight and slow to release, with hints of dark chocolate chips, espresso bean and black fruit lingering behind a walls of tannins and bright acidity. This will age well, but certainly wait a little longer to open.
Bland white-fruit aromas are a bit oily and gritty. This has a watery feel and mildly bitter flavors of white grapefruit, the skin included

Though without the richness that has defined California Cab in recent decades, this bottling is more of a classic Old World-leaning expression that is slowly coming back in vogue.

Heavy, chunky and waxy, and really not that appealing. There's more than enough baked notes, corn and mealy qualities. Not much else to say.

Racy and tart, this is more acid than fruit, with modest apple and citrus flavors and a bouquet of lime and wet stones. Try with oysters or other fresh shellfish.

This wine has a flinty, minerally personality, with a full  overlay of toasty oak. Don't look for fat, blockbuster fruit here—the flavors tend toward lime and tangerine. The oak adds caramel, vanilla and smoky notes. It's supple in the mouth but closes strangely flat.
Definitely inexpensive, but for a few dollars more, one might find more fruit and texture. This is an earthy, basic quaffer that'll please mostly on price.
Grown in Santa Barbara County pioneer Rick Longoria's estate vineyard, this grabs attention with tobacco smoke and funky earth aromas. On the palate, the savory smells switch to bright acidity, with cranberry and barely ripe raspberry taking hold and evolving into a lasting finish. Stunning now, but it will emerge through 2019.
Robust black-fruit aromas suggest plum and blackberry. This everyday red is concentrated, generous and packed with power. Flavors of dark berry fruits, chocolate and espresso finish with verve and clarity.

This bright Trebbiano offers aromas of cut grass, green olive, citrus and stone fruit. The light, lean mouthfeel would wash down with fried calamari.
Appealing black-fruit aromas include notes of tobacco and chocolate. This is a brooding, deep Tinto Fino with grippy tannins. Ripe berry, plum and cassis flavors are flush, while this wine finishes dark, with a reprise of young, rubbery tannins. Best from 2019–2030.

Typical of early-maturing, Merlot-based wines from this vintage, this is rich, swirling with black-berry fruits and generous tannins. The fresh, almost crisp aftertaste is already attractive. Drink from 2019.

Frothy and foamy, this delicately fragrant Prosecco delivers a bouquet of white flowers and orange blossom. The wine has direct, palate-cleaning effervescence and keeps your mouth polished and refreshed.

This is a full-bodied, solid wine, dominated at this early stage in its development by tannins as well as black currant fruits. The wine is potentially warm, perfumed with truffles and spice. Age for a couple of years.

Fold in some cedar, bitter chocolate, heat and tobacco and you have the total package. Drink now through 2012.
This is a high intensity wine with a lot going on aroma-wise: Red cherry, vanilla, roasted peanut, chestnut, Indian spice, cola and some cooked green notes are distinguishable elements in a complex package. Although the nose has complexity, it's a hair shy of absolute harmony.
Rounded in baked and dried fruit aromas, this is a soft, gentle wine with tangy acidity and swathes of ripe apple and orange citrus. A backbone of subtle oak gives it structure and complexity, finishing lean and bright, with a darker, richer twist of vanilla and clove in the mix.

By all accounts, 2008 was a tough vintage with cool weather, stunting frosts and ripeness issues. This wine seems afflicted: its opening is good, with coconut and floral shadings. But the palate is limited in richness and the flavors are standard, with char and barrel notes creating bitterness. Nice and honest for a subpar year.
A 70-30 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, this opens with oak-driven aromas of spice and toast, which give it a bold personality. Loads of bright cherry, blackberry, plum and licorice flavors appear on the palate to balance out the spice. Smooth but firm tannins give the wine structure and longevity.

A powerful, chunky wine, packed with solid tannins that promise good aging. It has a sense of drama in its spice, dark tannins and spacious fruit. This is going to develop well over 5–10 years.

Feels choppy on one hand and lactic on the other, with mostly oak-based, sweet flavors of maple, vanilla and mocha. Feels O.K. but creamy on the finish, and it tastes candied and artificial throughout.
Red-fruit aromas of currant and raspberry aren't sophisticated but they are good and fruity. Firm and solidly built, this likeable, easy-drinking blend offers plum, blackberry and raspberry flavors along with a loamy finish that contains a ripe hint of raisin.
This has a powerful, briary character, with a spicy, high-alcohol kick. It erupts in the mouth, with flavors of wild berry, tobacco, cola, anise and white pepper that should pair well with equally spicy fare, preferably fatty meats and cheeses.

This French-Australian collaboration has turned out a soft, easy-to-drink Merlot with notable complexity. Cassis and black cherry fruit is backed by shadings of cedar and vanilla and eased along by a creamy texture and supple tannins. Without any track record, it's probably prudent to drink this over the next few years.
Difficult to assess. It's soft and a bit syrupy, but the texture isn't bad, and the cassis and chocolate flavors are impressive for their ripe lushness. A bit eccentric and kind of hot, but there's something about it that's likeable.
Produced close to the sea at Bandol, this wine has a good proportion (20%) of Mourvèdre in the blend. That adds to the richness and brings out a fine aromatic floral character. Wild strawberries flavors give a rich ready-to-drink aftertaste.

Similar to the winery's '05 Russian River bottling in the ripeness of the fruit and tannins, but somehow fresher, although it's still a big, full-bodied Pinot Noir. Maybe it's the acidity that makes the framboise and cherry flavors come alive. Deeper notes of Portobello mushrooms and balsamic suggest moderate aging possibilities. Drink now through 2009.
A bit soft and dull, with flat, uninspiring flavors of cherries, cola and oak. Feels inert, lifeless, although all the parts are there for a fine wine.
High acidity and ultraripe fruit, in the form of pineapples, mangoes, pears and lemons, give this Chard a rich, exotic taste. New French oak adds the perfect touch of buttered toast. It's an impressive, intense young wine of high pedigree.
Unlike some of the old, wood-aged Moscatels, this gold colored wine has kept so much freshness and bright acidity to contrast the honeyed intensity and yellow fruit flavors. It is sweet, but not cloying because it is kept crisp by a touch of citrus that cuts through the honey. Drink now.
This is a young-colored wine that has been wood aged to smooth out the natural fruitiness of the Merlot. That gives the wine a smoky character with juicy acidity balanced by wood and toast flavors. The black plum flavors are rich, full in the mouth with a dry underlay of tannins. Drink from 2017.
This vintage of Barolo Riserva San Bernardo (a wine that consistently scores in the 90-point range) appears much grittier and more oak-driven than past expressions. Carpentry shop and wood shavings come to the forefront of mature plum and blackberry jam.
This light and herbal reserve has scents of pine needles and tart cherry. It spent 10 months in 25% new French oak, adding just a delicate hint of chocolate to the finish.
87-89 Barrel sample. Ripe fruit certainly, but over a structure which is much more mineral and dark. Maybe without the power of some of the year's wines, but it will show well in a more delicate style.
Bursts of tropical citrus, mango and melon abound from nose to finish in this forward,fruity off-dry Riesling. Its uncomplicated fruitiness is a bit reminiscent of mixed-fruit cocktail, but it's juicy and approachable for a wide audience. Drink now through 2018.
Michael David makes bombastically huge wines, but here they've mastered the style, making a black-as-night Syrah true to it's roots, with flavors of dark red fruit, bacon and toast, with a wall of vanilla and oak. It's juicy, jammy and surprisingly well integrated, a wine that's ready to drink now, preferably with a sizzling tri-tip.
Full and fleshy, this spicy, fruity Pinot Gris offers fresh fruit and citrus peel flavors, balanced against tangy acidity. The fruit is a mix of interesting flavors – grapefruit, apple and white peach. Good length and a fine value.
A bit of an experiment, this wine employs whole-cluster fermentation and carbonic maceration. It is intensely herbal and funky, with a strong presence of stem inclusion and black licorice. It finishes a tad flat.
This is a hands-on wine filled with everything toasty oak and lees can add. The underlying flavors are fairly lean, suggesting citrus fruits and a hint of green apple. The result is not a big, fat Chard, but a tight, crisp and elegant one. Perfect with roasted chicken.
A nose of papaya, white fruit, and lemon verbena is pleasant, while the mouthfeel has nice balance, smooth and round without being fat. Has cantaloupe and tropical fruit in the mouth, then finishes with a pithy note.
This is the lightest wine in the range from Berne. It's all about lively red fruits, fresh acidity and immediate drinkability. And it's ready to drink.
The blend is half Dolcetto, 40% Baco Noir, and the rest a mix of Tempranillo and Syrah. Creative, to be sure. What emerges is a rustic, fruity, forward, simple and slightly gamy red, the sort of wine that might be served in a carafe in a Mediterranean cafe. Light and fruity, with a spicy kick to the finish.
Here's a rich and smoky Chard with nice aromas and flavors of wood-grilled red apples with a caramel drizzle, peach pit and Key lime citrus. Solidly structured with good heft, a long finish and prominent acidity that keeps the wine from going over the edge and being too flabby. Drink now.
Initially this smells green and candied, with overripe and underripe aromas. The palate is chunky and bulky, while flavors of black fruits and green herbs finish grassy, with notes of oregano and tarragon. Overall this is heavy, extracted, sweet and sticky.
This is a beautiful, ripe, full-bodied sparkler, balancing rich fruit with bottle age to produce a round, elegant character. It is delicious to drink now, although there is enough fruit to allow it to age for 2–3 years.
Very fruity, in fact superfruity, this wine attacks with ripe pie-filling raspberries, red cherries, pomegranates, cola and vanilla-cocoa flavors that flood the mouth, lasting through a long, spicy finish. All that fruit is balanced with crisp acids, while a touch of dusty tannins adds to the fullness. Drink now.
Slightly sweet, with scouring bubbles, this is one of Korbel's fuller-bodied sparklers. It's rich and delicious in raspberry, strawberry, vanilla and dough flavors. For such a nice bubbly, this comes at an excellent price.
A better bottle than the Champoux Cab, this Red Mountain offering brings flavors of raspberry and strawberry preserves. The extra year or two in bottle has softened it up somewhat; though it still shows some signs of both reduction and volatile acidity. This needs to be drunk up; it is not likely to improve.
This well-loved vineyard brings old vine complexity into play. The brambly berry fruit is enhanced with lighter notes of earth and compost, cola and a dash of brown sugar. The acids are bright and citrusy, with a pineapple tang.
Structured, mineral and tense, this is a classic Pouilly Fuissé. It has lemon and crisp sliced white fruits, very linear in character with a bright, tight texture. The wine is young and could age until 2016.

Too sweet, with a sugary finish that tastes like lemonade and pineapple juice.
This Malbec-led blend contains 20% Syrah, but it's the Malbec that drives it. Crisp, toasty aromas of graphite, lemony oak and blackberry are tight and not at all lazy. A massive palate is choppy, with rugged tannins. Baked black-fruit flavors of cassis, mocha, tobacco and chocolate end long and loamy, with unbroken concentration. Drink through 2025.
This is a complex wine that offers firm tannins and rich fruit. It has weight, density and a strong sense of ripeness. With balance and depth, it's a wine with good aging potential. Drink from 2015.
Made from Roussanne and Grenache Blanc, this is an undeniably delicious, rather sweet white wine. This is so huge in orange, guava and nectarine flavors, but it's also a bit high in alcohol, which gives it a jalapeño-like heat.
Finely textured, this wine carries flavors of crisp, green plum skin and lemon zest. Youthful fruitiness is followed by lively acidity and a touch of toast. It's a wine to age; drink from 2015.
Drinking at its prime, the Isabella blends 56% Cabernet Sauvignon, 33% Malbec and 11% Petit Verdot. Muscular and solid, the fruit flavors of cherry and plum are framed with ripe tannins. Accents of toasted walnuts, coffee and cream complete a thoroughly satisfying finish.
This dry, lithe and almost athletic Rhône-style wine made from 55% Grenache Noir and 45% Cinsault shows a different approach to rosé from the candy-sweet versions. It's a perfect pour for lunch or a pre-dinner drink and has the acidity and body to pair with cedar planked salmon or even beef tri-tip. It's that good.
After hard-edged, herbal aromas mellow, spicy, earthy notes of blackberry rise up. This feels full and big-boned, with baked, toasty black-cherry flavors that are so fully oaked that the finish turns bitter, with a bit of mocha.
Pretty threadbare in fruit, with watery pineapple flavors covered with lots of toasty, sweetly caramelized oak. Will satisfy Chardonnay fans who like this sweet style.

90-92 Barrel sample. Under new ownership after the sale by Alain Raynaud, this is now a lighter style of wine. But it does have great acidity, really fresh, with smoky tannins.
Dusty fruit and chemical/plastic aromas are a little off-putting. This feels tight and shows moderate snappy tartaric acid. Flavors of mint, herbs and spiced plum are fair for the variety but green.
There's some volatility to the strawberry and raspberry notes, followed by cherry and white almond accents. The palate feels thin, and the wine presents simple, clean lines.
No winery in California has explored this French variety more than Cambiata, and with the '06, they've produced another interesting wine. It has weight and body and tannins, with wild black and red berry, currant, cherry liqueur, Provençal herb, tobacco and roasted meat flavors that finish with sweetness, although the wine is totally dry.
Smoky, dark, rich and very oaky, with leather and cheese aromas. This is one concentrated, tannic bruiser; it's fully extracted and roasted, with blackberry, molasses, pepper and coffee flavors. A lush, round, jammy specimen that pours on richness in place of elegance and sophistication.

The precision and elegance the winery is known for is on full display.
Very soft and open, this wine seems to be all froth and apples-and-cream flavors. It has a light touch of acidity, which comes through as the froth subsides.

Gothic is the project of a New York-based restaurateur and sommelier team. This spent 10 months in 15% new French oak. Scents and flavors of rubber tire dominate, and the tannins are hard and harsh. Airing it out helps a bit, but the bitterness does not entirely disappear.

Sweet and soft, with cherry pie, date and toffee flavors dominating. You could almost drink it as a dessert wine.

The shy nose gives away a flinty hint of reduction. The palate has a juicier, easier quality where green pear, slightly earthy yeast and fresh citrus are drawn together.

Spicy plum and candied oak aromas control the nose. The palate delivers a blend of raw acidity with buttery oak on top, while flavors of herbal plum and pepper are scratchy and finish herbal, spicy and low on fruit.
A dry-smelling wine, with hints of cinnamon, pine bark, eucalyptus and earth, that unfold slowly on the palate to reveal bright red cherries and berries. It's big and it's structured, yet finishes smooth and silky, blending in coffee and tea notes. Approachable now, but better after 2005.
Melon aromas are a touch mealy and suggest cantaloupe that's past its peak. A foamy palate is coarse, while tastes of burnt orange and red plum. On the finish, this dissipates quickly.
At five years of age, this is still a young wine, keeping much of its appeal firmly under wraps. The tight aromas and flavors only gradually reveal hints of their future grandeur in tantalizing glimpses of honey, anise, orange peel and pineapple. Yet the neverending length and pronounced minerality to this wine's finish leaves no doubt of its ultimate quality. Try after 2010?
This 61-acre estate was bought in 1981. This white is a beautifully crafted wine, layering cream, vanilla and pink grapefruit flavors. It is rich, ripe and ready to drink now.

A selection of lots not deemed worthy of inclusion in this estate's flagship red, Meandro is nevertheless a fine wine and an even better value. Smoke and herbs add complexity to the blueberries and blackberries found on the nose, while the flavors combine lush fruit with intense notes of spice and anise. Drink now–2008.
With its new wood and mint flavors, this is a smooth, polished wine, full of delicious ripe black fruit flavors and acidity. The wine is elegant, the wood already well integrated into the fruit. Age for 3–4 years.

Produced from vines up to 80 years old, this is a powerful, wood-aged wine. Tannins are mixed with toast, spice and dark plum flavors. Acidity gives freshness and finishes the wine with very fine fruits as well as structure. Age this impressive wine and drink from 2018.
This Roero benefits from an added layer of spice, clove and cinnamon that sits tight over floral notes and wild berries (a tiny percent of Barbera is added to the blend). There's a charred, smoky tone in the mouth and the finish is tight but firm.
Although the wine's intensity could overpower many foods, it remains an intriguing and penetrating white thanks to its notes of almond paste, melon, Golden Delicious apple, caramel and tiny tones of Marsala that add depth; snappy and full of flavor in the mouth. Imported by 5 Star Importers.
Rooty and earthy smelling, this has aromas of leather, cassis, tobacco, dried cheese and cola. It feels rich and nicely textured, with firm but friendly tannins that set up tobacco, coffee, mocha and roasted berry flavors. It's chocolaty in an uncanny way on the finish. Drink now through 2018.
A curiously earthy aroma announces a wine that is light, somewhat barnyard, the fruit behind the tannin. It has a juicy element leading to final cranberry acidity.
Rich and exotic, this Zin offers a blast of ripe wild blackberry, briary currants, mulberry, mocha, pepper and spice flavors that are wrapped into sturdy tannins. It's a strongly flavored wine that needs powerful fare to match it.
Rustic, with some minty flavors along with sweet, jammy fruit, and the oak is a little heavy. A big drop after the 2005 vintage.
An easy-drinking Côtes du Rhône, this isn't particularly intense but is harmonious from start to finish. Hints of garrigue accent black cherry and plum fruit, while the texture is silky.
Cherry and plum-like aromas carry a dry, dusty edge and some stem, but as a whole this wine is light on its feet, easy to drink and proper. The flavors are quite red in scope, with a twinge of buttery oak adding softness. Licorice and another tick of wood take care of the finish. A fresh, forward wine for everyday use.
The blend is Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Malbec, and the wine shows elements of all three varieties. They range from Cab's blackberry and cassis flavors and Syrah's peppery meatiness to the firm tannins of Malbec. The result is a lusty, delicious and somewhat rustic wine of great versatility at the table. Ready to drink now, especially with beef.
A rush of blueberry introduces this exceptional Malbec. Pure and deep, it is streaked with bark, iron, clove and dark chocolate. Impressively long and focused, this has the structure and balance to develop further in the bottle. But as a young wine, it is already delicious and utterly seductive.
There's a slightly sweaty note in the nose, but plenty of fruit in the mouth. Blueberry and black cherry, cassis and blue plum gather with substantial earthy chewy tannins. The high alcohol that's listed does not show in the flavor or the finish; in fact, this does a bit of a quick fade into flavors of coffee grounds.
Fragrant, with a grapy appeal, this pure Gamay Noir comes on like a fresh Beaujolais. The cherry candy flavor is fruity and fun, but the wine thins out rapidly onto a quick finish.
Lean, mildly green aromas offer minimal fruit, and there's a salinic, swimming pool set of aromas as well. The palate is fairly thick and solid, with big tannins and flavors of candied fruits and carob that lean toward green. Shows big body and weight, but the nose is only fair while the flavors are herbal.
Despite its seven years of age (two of which were spent in oak), this is a seemingly youthful wine with bright and lively fruity tones of berries, cherry soda or candy, red apple backed by a supporting cast of vanilla, cedar and roasted nuts. It offers chewy, firm tannins and good length on the finish.
The aromas of cocoa, woodspice, cassis, cherry and herbs are brooding on this 100% varietal wine that hails from Red Mountain. Palate-coating cherry flavors are supported by dry, lightly gritty tannins and tart acids.
Peaches and white flowers make for a very seductive first act. The full-bodied palate lacks a bit of concentration but offers up appealing notes of canned peaches, pears and apricots. Slightly short but tasty finish. Drink now.
Earth aromas meld with cherry and boysenberry fruit and continue through to the palate, where just the faintest tannic grip peeks through. This sumptuous red shows a bit less acidity than typical for Piedmont, making it a good partner for something in a slightly sweet sauce; think pulled pork or barbecued ribs.
The bouquet mixes bramble and berry notes, which turn rougher and more vegetal as time passes. The palate is peppery and light, with just adequate cherry and berry flavors. A light, distant wine with some similarities to Beaujolais Nouveau.
The floral, vanilla tone of new oak marries with ripe, red cherry notes in this wine, supported by clove and violet highlights. It's young and taut on the palate, its fine tannins still firm and crunchy, needing time to evolve and relax. Pure fruit and the pervasive freshness promise a bright future. Drink 2019–2025.
Jasmine and orange blossom dot the nose of this nicely made wine, a variety not often found in California. Apple rind defines the crisp, mineral-laden experience, focused and clear in its rocky texture of wet stone.
There is only the faintest of aromas on this soft, lightly juicy wine. It is a warm-climate wine, rounded, soft and gentle. The freshness comes at the end, bright and with a citrus touch.
Silky and luscious, this extraordinary Sémillon from the makers of the Chateau Rollat red wines sends up cascading scents of orange blossom, orange peel, citrus and light tropical, moving into the mouth with beautifully integrated fruits dappled with honey and tea. Elegant and impressively long, it concludes with a light kiss of toast.
This Bricco Luciani expression of Nebbiolo shows pretty berry nuances that are woven carefully between mesquite, cola, spice and white pepper. There's personality and dimension here and the wine tastes particularly bright and vibrant in the mouth. You could pair this Barolo with quail or Cornish hen.
Blackberry, violets, gingerbread, cola and cedar show on the great nose of this blend of 50% Grenache and 50% Syrah from the Fallbrook area north of San Diego. Complex flavors of incense and juniper spice up the backbone of blueberry and black plum, with a beef char component adding to the savory side.
A pretty bottle of Sangiovese in every way—great label, great aromas and bright, cranberry and cherry fruit. From one of Amador County's steady Sangiovese specialists, the Noceto Normale also has pleasing acidity and texture and would be very welcome next to a plate of pasta or pizza or even meats off the grill.
Castello di Bolgheri enjoys some of the most coveted vineyard sites that are located a stone's throw away from the Bolgheri castle tower. The blend is Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, and it delivers black fruit aromas, backed by wet earth, button mushroom and leather notes. It feels plush, yet structured.
Aromas of stewed berry fruits, olive and herbs combine to form a soupy bouquet. This is fairly racy, with a touch of spiky tartaric acid creating mild astringency. Stewy, roasted flavors of black fruits and carob finish herbal.
A deeply flavored, smooth Cabernet with the balance and elegance to drink with fine fare. It feels rich and plush, with aggressive tannins that frame ripe flavors of black cherries, red currants, cola, herbs and oak. Could even age for 2-4 years, although beyond that is a gamble.
This wine leaps out of the glass with fresh and bright aromas of strawberry blossoms, ripe raspberries, red flowers and a tiny bit of iron. The flavors are reminiscent of a potpourri satchel, with dried hibiscus flowers, tart cranberries, sour cherries and touches of pencil lead.
Sweet and sugary, with a green, gooseberry edge to the lemon and lime flavors.
Black Kite has established itself in a short time as a winery to watch from the increasingly impressive Anderson Valley. The grapes for this bottling are from the “deep end,” the coolest, foggiest part of the appellation, and the wine is firm in acids. Yet it's supple and silky and elegant, with bracing cherry, currant, balsam, soy and oak flavors that are complex and delicious.
Fire up the barbecue for this lusty, spicy Zinfandel. It's ripe in raspberry and cherry fruit, with lots of dusty cinnamon, clove, anise and pepper spice flavors. The sweetness and acidity will play well against tomato-based grill sauces.
Heavy in alcohol and overripe, but entirely dry, and the black currant, chocolate and pepper flavors will play well against richly sauced barbecue.
In this price range, this is one of the best Pinot Grigios on the market. It's just slightly off-dry, with excellent acidity providing balance to the citrus, green apple and tropical fruit flavors.
Low in alcohol by California standards, but offers plenty of flavor by way of grapefruit, Meyer lemon and fresh, green grass. Rich notes of ripe orange, lees and oak are balanced by brisk, bright acidity. A very nice expression of a white Bordeaux-style wine.
Brooding dark fruit and luxurious French oak spices intermingle on the aromas. The palate is seamless with pitch-black fruit flavors. Not a shy wine, it's an exhibition of power.
Cranberry, baked rhubarb, anise and crushed slate aromas show on the nose of this always-excellent bottling from the Franscioni family. The palate abounds with energy, driving black raspberry fruit accented with earthy loam, fennel, oregano and juniper through a compellingly round midpalate.
Overripe aromas of raisin and prune are matched on a dense raisiny palate that tastes like baked black fruits. The entirety of this wine is raisiny but not unfriendly or difficult.
85-87 Pushing dryness, and tannins, the wine feels extracted, hard. The fruit doesn't catch up with the structure.
This is a wine with good depth of flavor. The toast and wood characters are already balancing well with the soft, juicy fruit and acidity. It will age for 2–3 years and round out.
Full-bodied and loaded with finesse, this wine opens with multifaceted aromas of ripe orchard fruit, candied citrus zest, pressed flower and mineral tones. The focused, elegant palate offers ripe apple, pear, tangy nectarine, lemon drop and flint. While enjoyable now, this will drink well through 2023.
Dense and structured via dark, dry tannins, this is a big wine, showing power but not great subtlety. If you want solid Burgundy, this is the wine.
Very nice apple blossom and lightly stony aromas greet you, and the apple and apricot flavors are juicy and ripe. This is an all-fruit wine with just enough acidity and minerality to keep it in shape. Finishes with citrus and melon. Drink now.
Produced from 30-year-old vines, this 55% Cabernet Sauvignon wine is firm with tannins as well as black-currant fruit. It is balanced with the potential to become a fruity wine with a soft texture. The acidity will keep it crisp and on point. Drink from 2018.
A lovely Cabernet Sauvignon that shows its fine mountain pedigree. Accessible now, with decanting, for the upfront blackberry, black currant, plum, sweet cedar and mineral flavors that feel so rich and balanced and drily tannic. Should develop well over the next 6-8 years.
Earthy black-fruit and spice aromas are clean and welcoming, while this is potent and full of life on the palate. Black cherry, coffee and chocolate flavors are intense and finish with a notable amount of minty menthol character. Drink through 2019.
Here's one of the bigger Chards of the year. Explodes with aromas of butterscotch, caramel, vanilla, and, oh yes, tropical fruits. The flavors are mouth-filling and rich, like a sweet, custardy, creamy, tangerine-flavored dessert, yet it's dry. However, it loses a few points for being too big and aggressive without the necessary balance. It's awkward.
A ripe, perfumed, relatively soft wine, which is going to give great pleasure with its juicy fruit, ripe jelly flavors and balancing acidity. You could enjoy this wine within a year, but it should age well over the next five or six.
Medium cherry in color, this blend comes from a mixture of Williamson and the winery's estate vineyard. It's brightly aromatic with notes of cherry and strawberry, drinking medium bodied with good depth of flavors, though at times seeming a bit ponderous.
Very aromatic, this has flavors of lychee and lemon. It has a spicy feel to it, giving it a soft, rounded texture. Ready to drink.
Modest apple aromas are a bit sweaty. This feels standard, with acidic lift. Flavors of apple, peach and nectarine are jumpy and citric, while the finish is zesty and citrusy in feel but short on flavor and complexity.
Too oaky, with dominating caramel and smoke flavors, and also very sharp. There's a citrusy bite of acidity that detracts. Finally, the wine ends on an overripe, Porty note.
A maderized color and flat, old-smelling aromas of molasses and baked beans are barely cutting it. This feels tired, with mildly oxidized flavors of raisin, tobacco and vanilla. Tomato and herbal notes carry the finish on this mostly gone Rioja.
This ripe tropical-fruit style of Sauvignon Blanc is delicious. Its crisp side with some citrus is balanced by the apricot and ripe mango flavors that give the wine richness and fine perfumes. This is a food style of wine, ready to drink from 2018.
Flavors of sour grapefruit and almond are somewhat masked by the amped-up oak.
Understated grapefruit and herbal aromas lead the way, framing peach and melon flavors. Round and soft on the palate, then turning a bit chalky on the finish. Drink now.
Here's a rich expression of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot in equal parts, with obvious notes of eucalyptus and black licorice lavished over a core of black cherry, leather and tobacco. The eucalyptus element is very evident and gives the wine a unique personality.
Saucy aromas shadow cassis and plum scents. This feels big and chunky, but the flavors are not fully ripe and are instead slightly green and mulchy. A stewed character spills over onto the finish.
This fine wine is made in larger quantities than many of the producer's other offerings, affording a chance to be introduced to a lovely white characteristic of the vintage and region in its friendly waves of pineapple, lemon and Gravenstein apple. Chalky on the palate at first, it provides a medium body and length with a back note of herb and anise.
Named after the grandfather (Aïeul in the local patois) of the current owner, the wine is concentrated and powerful. It is rich wine with a smooth character that belies the dense tannins behind it. Blackberry fruit and tight acidity give this wine aging potential. Drink from 2020.
The wine is soft, fruity and opulent, with apples and a touch of melon. It also has the fine Chablis steeliness that gives a crisp edge to the warm, ripe and rounded fruit. It still needs time to bring out the full fruitiness. Drink from 2017.
Dark and scented with cocoa, coffee, cherry and a dash of vanilla, this is a tannic, chewy Merlot. Hints of herb and a big splash of green tea-flavored tannins wrap it up; it's not what you would call a gentle wine. It should really be served with some red meat to cut through the tannins.
This has a heady fragrance of orange blossom and apricot. The smooth, creamy palate offers white peach, lemon drop and citrus flavors, plus a note of cream-filled pastry. The wine has a round structure and refined effervescence.
Relatively light in the glass, this blend of nine vineyards from up and down the coast shows savory baked plum, cardamom dust, earthy cranberry, bay leaf and smoked meat on the nose. It's medium bodied on the palate and very down-the-middle flavor-wise, with cranberry, oregano and thyme elements.
Produced from a field blend of old vines in a gravity-fed winery at Quinta da Faísca, this is a concentrated and structured wine from grapes grown in the Vale de Mendiz in the heart of the Douro. Still young and still masking the black fruits with the tannins, it is slow to develop. It is rich, though, full in the mouth and likely to be a fine wine as it slowly matures. Drink from 2019.
This is wide and sweet on the bouquet, with pear and cider aromas. It feels thick and a bit grabby, with basic apple flavor and not much more. Long on the finish, it has a decent feel if you don't mind some excess foam.
Funky rubbery aromas include a note of compost. This feels grabby, with citric acidity. Briny salty slightly vegetal flavors leave you asking, “Where's the fruit?”
This reedy smelling, jammy boxed wine is on the cusp of acceptability. It's gooey in feel, a bit fake and sugary in flavor, and sticky on the finish.
Heavy aromas of herbal berry fruits and wood smoke are rustic. This wine feels resiny and edgy, while saucy, oaky flavors of pancetta and tomato finish with notes of sausage, fennel and bacon.
Fresh and straightforward, with earthy raspberry fruit and grass scents followed by intense herbal-spiked cherry liqueur flavors on the palate. With its well-managed tannins, this is a good choice for lighter beef dishes, like pot roast.
A beautifully perfumed wine that comes from vines planted in the 1980s. Touches of the wood aging are apparent, along with the black plum and berry fruits. It's a dense while also elegant wine with acidity and fresh fruitiness alongside the complex structure. Drink this wine from 2019.
Round and soft, this is immediately drinkable. Its acidity and green fruit flavors are well balanced; the wine dances easily on the palate. Screwcap.
Described as the “wine served at the Vienna Opera Ball,” Austria's most glittering social occasion, this is a smooth style of Grüner Veltliner. It floats easily with pear and green plum flavors topped with a serving of cream.
Aromas of bitter greens and stony fruits are simple and subdued. The palate deals just one note of lime before finishing with grapefruit. Not a lot going on besides respectable, midlevel citrus. Drink right away.
This cool climate Roussanne shows more of a steely side of the grape, rather than ripe, round and fleshy. Citrus skin and peach pit flavors combine with a slight suggestion of chalk and mineral.
The cherries and dark plums on the nose and palate are accented by herbs and cinnamon. This light and dry wine is mildly astringent and closes with tart raspberry and cedar notes.
Yorba's Tempranillo is very masculine, briary and tannic, packed with earthy baked plum, raspberry and dark chocolate mocha, with a slight trace of black licorice. Concentrated and lush, it would stand its own against many a big slab of meat.
From Pinot Noir, with just a touch of Pinot Meunier, this is a powerful, full-bodied wine, with aromas of dried flowers and flavors of stewed fruits, balanced with honey and fresh, crisp acidity. Weighty; this is definitely a food-friendly Champagne.
I'll admit upfront that I have a soft spot for this wine—the 1985 version was the first wine I purchased by the case (I think the whole case set me back about $60). The wine remains a bargain, even though the price tag has roughly doubled. The aromas this year are pretty restrained, but the wine explodes on the palate, giving up impressive flavors of plum, blackberry, earth and pepper, along with hints of anise and tar. The long finish confirms its quality.
This easygoing red opens with aromas of dark fruit, red berry, toast and a whiff of cooking spice. The palate offers crushed plum, clove and a hint of chocolate alongside soft tannins. It's simple but well made.
Bitter black cherries are the hallmark of this rather hard-edged wine. It shows dark tannins and fruit that misses full richness. Maybe it is restrained power, maybe it will age, but the balance is not there now.
Reduced when first opened, this wine shows its lemony, fresh apple notes with a bit of air. It has the lovely midpalate texture and freshness inherent to good Chardonnay and fills the mouth with citrus and orchard fruit notes. Slender, structured and fresh-faced, it only needs some time to breathe.
Sweet, intriguing aromas of orange peel, spearmint and boysenberry jam give this individuality, while the flush palate serves up soft but ripe plum and berry flavors. Uncomplicated, with weight and adequate freshness.
Bold aromas of bread dough and strong flavors of herbs and stewed fruit flavors compete for attention. This wine is medium bodied, smooth in texture and rustic in flavor.
With its rich chocolate and spice flavors, this rolls around the mouth like velvet, its fruit so well-integrated with the wood and the vanilla that it is seamless. A delicious wine that deserves 3–4 years aging.
This wine is structured, with a strongly tannic character that's both fruity and tangy. A deliciously refreshing, zesty character gives lightness and lively acidity. Minerality cuts through to give a strong texture. Drink from 2017.
Aromas of Nestea ice tea and slightly past-their-prime flowers are followed by medium-sweet fruit flavors that need more acid to stand them up. It doesn't all come together.
Fresh-faced Sauvignon Blanc, with distinct citric character and a green herbal edge. A lightweight wine that has a great zesty finish.
An easy-drinking wine, it has pronounced aromas and flavors of cherry vanilla soda, blackberry preserves and just a touch of menthol.
Floral plum and horsey aromas comprise the nose on this multigrape blend led by Bobal. A grabby palate exhibits raw, tough tannins, while plum and berry flavors finish rugged.
This opens with aromas suggesting fragrant purple flower, blackberry, damp soil and a whiff of used leather. The simple palate isn't as expressive as the nose, offering raw red berry and a hint of white pepper set against brisk acidity and drying, rather fleeting tannins.
Explosive Barolo, with scents of roses and cherries that just burst from the glass. There are boatloads of tannins, but they're ripe and soft, and the wine just seems to add complexity and elegance with every sip, picking up hints of licorice, red plums, leather, spice and earth. Long and velvety on the finish. Drink 2010–2020, possibly longer.
Tomato vine, elderflower, cut grass and tropical fruit aromas lead the nose on this vibrant wine. The savory palate offers honeydew melon, peach, grapefruit and flinty mineral while zesty acidity gives it a tangy finish.
A hint of wood is a good sign of the richness and balance of this wine. There is some dryness and tautness to go with its black cherry and plum-skin flavors. There is a big and bold fruity aftertaste.
A simple, everyday Chardonnay that's refreshingly crisp, with sweet lime, orange, pear and vanilla flavors.
Oh, what a rich Zin this is. It's like biting into a chocolate truffle that melts in your mouth. Then comes the blackberry liqueur, cherry pie, cinnamon roll. The wine is dry, but at the cost of mind-blowing alcohol, 16.5%. Love it or not, there's nothing like it.
Not your usual red blend, this light wine has a red berry and rhubarb profile. The feel is easy, but with slightly high-strung fruit and acidity, and some peppery tannins on the close.
Pours light in color and feels light in body, with pleasant raspberry, cola and spice flavors, and a dry finish. Despite high alcohol (15.5%) it's not hot.
This crisp wine is packed with acidity and fruitiness. It is tangy, tight, full of attractive acidity as well as lively citrus and white fruits. It is ready to drink.
Frankly sweet, this simple wine is ripe in strawberry and raspberry flavors, and has decent acidity.
This Zin, which gets a boost from 20% Grenache and 5% Petite Sirah, shows a slightly sweet touch on the nose, where dark strawberry and baked cherries meet with a touch of asphalt. The palate is quite syrup and fruit-driven, with blueberry, blackberry, cola and root-beer flavors reminiscent of soda-pop concentrate.
Fragrant blue flower, menthol and a hint of exotic spice aromas come together on this firmly structured wine. The elegant palate still needs to fully open up but already reveals ripe Marasca cherry, crushed raspberry, white pepper and a hint of orange peel alongside firm, polished tannins. Drink after 2018–2023.
This is an interesting, outright strange wine that opens with a full golden color and an aromatic veil of smoke, dust or chalky mineral over exotic fruit and peach. One item out of place is the alcohol, which emerges strong in the mouth.
From fifty-year old, high altitude vines on Mt. Etna, this is a stunning and structured rosato made from native grape Nerello Mascalese. It's loaded with finesse, boasting tart apple, wild cherry, strawberry, white pepper, red grapefruit and intense mineral sensations alongside crisp acidity.
Tasting a bit tight and candied now, this Pinot might just need a little time in the bottle to knit together. It has that jammy, young wine taste of fresh cherries and raspberries, and mouthwatering acidity. Give it until mid-2009.
A smooth, supple, flat-out delicious wine. It strikes a perfect balance, showing ripe but not heavy fruit flavors in a pleasing mix of strawberry, pomegranate, hints of berry, citrus and plenty of acid. This just hits the nail right on the head; no huge alcohol, no new oak.
Undulating with richness and flavor. There's a textural brilliance that stands out on this sumptuous Trockenbeerenauslese-style Riesling from the North Fork's Roman Roth. Gorgeously perfumed with roses, freesia, lanolin and honey, it's a complex, composed representative of a fine American dessert wine.
Herbal aromas of olive and sweaty leather require patience. In the mouth, this is firm and acidic, with a spiky feel and peppery flavors of mint and spice that outmuscle the wine's fruit component. A dry, acid-driven finish is the close.
This wine opens with vanilla, smoke, lemon peel and pear. The linear palate offers tart yellow apples, yellow grapefruit, graphite and a hint of vanilla alongside bright acidity.
This wine opens with pleasing cocoa, dark raspberry and graphite aromas. The palate offers medium-bodied, tart fruit flavors cinched with tannin. A big, bold interpretation of Merlot.
This firm, dark and still young wine has intense acidity that comes from the red currant and raspberry fruit. The tannins though form the real basis of this concentrated wine. Great juicy fruits at the end will develop well. Drink from 2018.
This beautifully ripe and juicy wine adds a hint of menthol to the ripe black currant and black cherry aromas and delivers round, rich fruit impressions on the palate. It has a lush mouthfeel, mild tannins and a clean, fruity finish. Cabernet Franc makes up 40% of the blend, along with Petit Verdot, Malbec and Syrah.
Part of a trio of Best Buy wines from this producer in 2010, this easy Pinot Grigio delivers the goods in a cheerful, no-fuss package. Crisp lemon is backed by peach and pear.
This bone-dry wine has a soft, ripe touch. It is crisp at the start and at the end, with attractive fresh sliced apple and pineapple fruit flavors. It can be drunk now.
Tangent's been on a roll with dry white wines from the cool appellations of San Louis Obispo. Here's a Pinot Blanc that shows real varietal character. It's marked by peach, mango and white pepper flavors boosted by the high natural acidity of its appellation, and is frankly a luscious, absolutely dry wine.
An intense, rounded wine, with fresh pear and apple flavors that offer freshness but also richness. Dry, but gives a softer side of Chenin, attractive now, but worth aging for 2–3 years.
Ample black fruit along with mint and herbs make for a solid if unusual bouquet. It's fairly ripe and sweet to the taste, with bold cherry and raspberry flavors. Textured on the finish, with zest. The only negative is that it's rowdy and unrefined, but hey, that's rosso piceno. Imported by Empson (USA) Ltd.
With zesty acidity, this Chardonnay's ripe pineapple, green apple and pear fruit flavors are balanced with a clean scour. It's a little sweet and direct, a wine to drink now.
A blend of Grechetto and Pinot Nero, this conveys aromas of toasted walnut, apple and citrus. The palate is a bit disjointed, offering bitter apple skin and almond skin alongside candied lemon drops and a confectionary note.
This feels the lightest of the three Poças Douro reds. It is medium-bodied, full of red fruits layered with tannins and plenty of fresh acidity. The texture is dry, while always full of fruit.
Boasts some interesting aromas of clove and black pepper, balanced by blackberry and cherry flavors. Nicely proportioned and well structured, with mild tannins and decent acidity; it's not a blockbuster—just a satisfying accompaniment to simply prepared red meats. With a butterflied leg of lamb off the grill, no one will guess you're serving a $10 wine.
Aromas of barrel spices, nougat and pear lead to a full-bodied palate, with tart, lemony acidity drawing out the flavors.
Quite Bordeaux in style, meaning the wine is leaner, tighter and more tannic than typical Southern Hemisphere blends usually amount to. But we very much like the wine's mineral, plum and juicy raspberry flavors. All in all, expect a sturdy, well-made wine with plenty of natural and barrel-aided tannins. Will likely improve with another year or two in bottle.
Finely perfumed, a wood-aged wine, smooth and creamy. There is an attractive mix of toast with apricot and white peach flavors, full in the mouth. With its herbs and spice edge, this could probably benefit from another year's aging.
Ripe, juicy peaches and nectarines burst from the nose and palate of this semisweet Riesling. Sunny and pristine, with a soft, lacy sweetness, it's balanced by bristling acidity and a delicate minerality on the finish.
Fresh cantaloupe aromas shift to savory pressed apple and pear on the palate of this juicy, easygoing Riesling. Semidry in style, it's pleasantly slick and sweet, accented by spice and honey notes. Drink now.
Full-bodied, it leans into stone fruits and light tropical. Tasted a few weeks before its official release, it remained a little sugary, with its relatively high alcohol (and lower acidity) adding to the impression of sweetness.
Rich, toasty, mature, this important Champagne is all those things. It's certainly mature for a 1998 vintage, which means it would be delicious to drink now. But the ripeness, allied to the serious acidity and wood structure, do suggest that it's likely to age more.
A classic Shiraz nose of plum pudding and rubber leads to a medium-weight palate that's got a bit of depth to it, with undertones of humus and fall leaves. Fresh black fruit pops up briefly on the short, crisp finish. Drink up.
Crisp and perfumed, this shows white berries, crisp white stone fruit and a great twist of lemon zest. It's light, floating, the acidity like a whisper within the fresh flavors. The final acidity stays forever.
A riper aspect of Bosc pear plays about this Grüner. The palate, however, reins this back in with punchy, zesty flavors of arugula, lemon rind and green pear. There is quite some concentration on the core as well as real verve and nerve.
This is an exceedingly pleasant wine (in a very heavy bottle) with modern tones of spice and leather that sit besides Nebbiolo's characteristic bouquet of wild berries and cola. The wine tastes full and generous in the mouth and offers both sweet and sour elements on the close.
Sweet and dry, this is a wine that shows its botrytis fruit character right up front. That's paired with orange marmalade and honey to give richness. The finish is light and crisp with acidity.
Strawberries are the core of the fruit here, with plenty of acidity behind. The wine thins out quickly in the midpalate, and finishes high-toned and lightly fruity.
A smooth and soft wine this is fruity, fresh and forward in style. Red-cherry flavor and gentle acidity dominate on the palate. It's rounded and ready to drink now. Finshes with a hint of sweetness.
This opens with grassy, green aromas of candied raspberry. A chunky palate delivers candied, caramelized, slightly weedy red-fruit flavors. Not a lot besides acidity and heat is driving the finish.
This wine employs 73% Spottswoode Estate Vineyard fruit, but also ventures to other sites, including Young Inglewood, Oakville Ranch and Darms Lane. Dusty cedar, blackberry and pencil shavings dot a structured, classically stylized landscape, additionally seasoned in black pepper and clove. It has length for miles; enjoy best 2023 through 2033.
This two-region Zin is from Atlas Peak and Amador County. It shows a really great Zin quality in the leathery spiciness that accompanies the berry flavors, and in the smooth, polished tannins. Amador seems to bring wildness, while Napa brings elegance. The result is a great Zinfandel at a great price.
This juicy white opens with a blend of citrusy and grassy aromas. The mouthfeel is healthy and round, with good acidic cut. Flavors of lime, Granny Smith apple and green herb are fresh and correct, while the finish is clear and refreshing. Drink now before it begins to fade.
Tang, mineral and a taut steely acidity, this wine is all about crispness. The lemon and sliced green apples are laced with acidity and with a concentrated texture. Drink this zesty wine from 2018.
Smells disturbingly funky or bretty, and seems shut down. Barely acceptable.
Deep ruby in the glass, this wine has a nose of fruits of the wood and smoke. It offers a sophisticated medley of fruit and savory flavors, in particular blackberry, raspberry, tobacco and leather. Firm tannins coat the mouth but do not overpower the palate, allowing for a surprisingly bright finish.
Lots of ripe pineapple jam and oak flavors on this sweet, creamy wine. Nothing complicated, but good enough to satisfy fans of the variety.
Round and soft in the mouth, yet without much flavor, just hints of peach and melon.
It's easy to call this a beautiful wine—it's dense and lush, with great layers of black fruit and acidity. The first fully biodynamic vintage from this estate has certainly yielded impressive ripe fruit, with structured tannins and dark berry flavors that linger long. It has enormous potential, certainly not be ready to drink before 2027.
An opulent nose of spicy cherry and cranberry invites one into the glass, before complementary flavors echo on the palate. Earthy forest floor and a piquant structure of acidity give it intrigue and complexity, before the wine finishes lean.
Latex, rubber band and other roasted, rubbery aromas send up the red flag, yet the palate and flavors are good enough even if they are already a little tired and rusty. Not really recommended given that rosé should be fresh and fun. This one veers to big berry fruit and softness. 100% Tempranillo. Imported by National Distributing Co., Inc.

What a difference a year makes: 2008 yielded a fine wine, but the warmer 2009 vintage has produced a classic Cava with pretty aromas of apples and fresh green herbs. It feels chiseled and tight, with a mix of green apple, peach and nectarine flavors. Smooth and easy on the finish.

Saint Clair's entry-level Sauvignon is a flashy, fruit-driven wine with a touch of green that's keeping reams of peach and grapefruit reined in.

Solid, luscious and silky smooth, this white wine from the northern Friuli region is one of the most beautiful expressions of the Pinot Bianco grape you'll find.

Marrying cranberry fruit to a stiff, herbal spine, this offers sensory highlights of hemp, thyme and oregano. Though reticent aromatically, this wine earns your interest with its nicely-threaded herbal elements and substantial, albeit stiff, finish.

This pure Carignan from 80-year-old vines is really interesting aromatically, featuring hints of clove, cinnamon and lavender, but its substantial tannins clamp down hard on the palate, raising the question of whether it has enough fruit concentration to age successfully.

The tannins and acidity are well integrated and lend to a long finish that ends on a charred-oak note.
Plum and dry spice aromas are solid and don't steer you wrong, while the palate has reasonably good depth and feel along with sweet berry flavors that show no variety or evolution once they get going. A little sugary on the finish, but solid as a whole.

Ripe and flashy, offering tiers of cassis, chocolate and charry new oak flavors, wrapped in sweet, smooth tannins. Has an acidic bite midpalate that balances the lushness, and will add to the wine's cellar-worthiness. Defines sheer power, but never loses control. Best now and through 2017, at least.
This grape is most commonly associated with Champagne, though David Lett established it as a varietal wine at Eyrie decades ago.

Spice, pomegranate, wild berry—all in a surprisingly lengthy wine whose flavors linger generously.

A finishing bitterness, which needs to soften out, is the only downside here.

This young wine has great potential. With powerful tannins and a dense texture, it is rich in black fruits and acidity. Concentrated and with a firm structure, the wine will age well. Produced from a blend that puts Bordeaux grapes with a small proportion of the local Abouriou, it will be ready in 2020.
Soft fruit, with a tannic hint underneath. The wine is supported at this stage by wood, while the fruit has strawberry jam sweetness. The acidity and structure really only come through at the end.

A chewy finish offers up robust pepper and chocolate notes to accent leftover berry flavors. Drink through 2019.
Baked cinnamon and cherry tart form a promising beginning into this wine, but an intrusive addition of root beer pushes it over the edge in terms of cloying flavor. The wine then becomes somewhat flimsy on the palate.

From three plots holding 75-year-old vines, this wine offers yellow fruits, apples and crisp pears. Plenty of fresh acidity gives it a crisp character, while the ripe fruit makes it refreshing and very ready to drink.
Stick with Sur's basic 2005 Malbec because it's fresher and cleaner than this raisiny, tannic brooder that tastes a little too much of stewy fruit and liqueur.

One of a pair of wines from the estate vineyard, this is medium bodied and modest in all proportions. Light citrus and cherry flavors combine in a pleasant, everyday style of Pinot Noir.
Smells and tastes of light brown sugar and soft red fruit. It's a simple, easy-drinking, accessible wine, and priced accordingly.
Spicy white pepper pervades this rich, rounded red. Structured tannins call for meat if this is to be drunk now. These will mellow by 2016 in cellar and the ripe, crunchy red fruit will come to the fore.
The second wine of Angélus is almost as structured as the first wine. It has serious tannins and dark acidity. At the same time, the fruit is rich with black-currant flavors. It is solid with plenty of potential. Drink this very fine wine from 2023.
Meaty and full up front, with density, earth and mild foresty dampness. The palate is balanced and weighty, with standard berry, cherry and plum flavors. A good wine that's fresh and properly sized. And the finish of coffee, cocoa, herbal notes and dried leaves is classic Maipo.

This unusual Oregon Malbec carries intense, rustic aromas mixing plum, grape, spice and saddle leather. Despite its very tight tannins, the wine tastes open and grapey, reminiscent of a Washington Lemberger, though not quite as soft.
A selection of wines made after harvest, this Reserva is a firm, perfumed, structured wine. It has powerful tannins that go with the black fruits and acidity, but it's also deliciously juicy—a powerful and ripe wine that will improve for several years.
The aromas are somewhat light considering the variety and style, with notes of orange peel and flower. It drinks sweet, finishing with orange flavors. It's enjoyable but the concentration doesn't seem all there.
This dry, brusque Merlot has hard tannins and tart acidity, and the fruit isn't very concentrated. Gets by with a taste of black cherries and currants. Drink up.
There's a really nice, creamy feel to this wine as it moves smoothly across the palate. As it does, the wine imparts lasting flavors of apricot, honey and Golden Delicious apple. There's a touch of almond spice too and you can't beat this low price.
From a very cool vintage, this wine takes full advantage of the flavors the year delivered. Bracing and fresh, with a lively mix of lime and citrus fruits, its vivid acidity and a wash of wet rock, give it life and length across the palate. Complex and textural, this is a lovely wine.
Fairly mineral on the nose, with tropical fruit aromas rounding out the bouquet. Quite fresh and crisp, yet a bit hollow in the midpalate and on the finish. Overall this is a perfectly good Albariño, totally competent for quaffing or drinking with fish.
A little overripe and raisiny, but otherwise delicious, with sculpted Napa tannins framing luscious flavors of blackberries, cherries, chocolate and sandalwood, and a generous sprinkling of peppery spices. Drink now.
Black fruit and mocha on the nose are followed by mocha, berry and cedar on the palate with this lively red. A touch of truffle and tobacco add to the appeal. Pair with lamb or grilled beef for added flavor.
This Chenin immediately draws you in with notes of baked apple, beeswax and softly toasted brioche. The rich, medium-weight mouth carries similar notes of spicy toast and ripe pear flavors. Full-flavored and easy to drink; enjoy now.
Pachàr is a blend of organically farmed Chardonnay, Viognier and Sauvignon that offers bright aromas of citrus, peach, pineapple and blanched almond. Pair this pretty wine with rice-stuffed zucchini or tomatoes.
Generous berry aromas smell floral. In the mouth, this is plump and soft in the middle but more tannic and stout on the edges. Baked blackberry, plum and cassis flavors finish with hard tannins and a sense of extraction. Expect a very full, chunky and ultimately satisfying Garnacha-based ride.
One of the group of vineyards that make up Domaines Lapalu, this wine is attractive and soft. It has generous black cherry and plum fruit along with gentle tannins that are already softening. Drink from 2019.
The name comes from a Django tune, and also means “clouds” in French. Nothing cloudy here though—it's a pretty, lively, fruit-driven blend with cherry candy flavors. Crisp and fresh, a streak of cola runs comet-like through the tail, along with a hint of mint.
A dense, sumptuously structured wine that is full both of tannins and juicy fruit. Black plum, layers of acidity and the lightest hint of wood aging all play a part in this already drinkable wine. It will be better in five years, so wait until 2017.
This offers aromas of red rose, wild berry, dark cooking spice and a whiff of sun baked earth. The ripe palate offers black cherry marinated in spirits, licorice, game and a hint of chocolate alongside velvety tannins. The warmth of alcohol closes the finish. Drink 2018–2029.
The 2003 Cliff Edge Shiraz shows plenty of intensity: bright cranberry-raspberry fruit, bold notes of cured meat and overtones of cedary oak. Tannins are supple, the structural underpinnings reliant on crisp acids instead. Use that tartness to offset some of the richness of stews or roasts.
The aromas lean a bit into the green but not in an untoward way, with notes of parsley and other green herbs in front of pencil lead and black fruit. The dark-fruit flavors bring a sense of restraint and polish that carries throughout the finish.
Flavors roll from cranberry to sweet red cherry in a red-fruit riot. It was aged in 52% new and 24% one-year-old oak, but it's unobtrusive and not especially toasty. The barrel time has begun to smooth out any bumps and rough edges, though a touch of phenolic bite remains. Drink from 2018 to 2022.
Mancini has 20% Carignane field-blended within, and shows burly, thick black fruit at its core. Integrated oak supports black cherry and pepper. A dustiness on the palate that finishes ripe.
This is a plush and opulent blend of Negroamaro and Malvasia Nera that opens with bold aromas of blackberry preserves, chocolate, tobacco and spice. The wine is lush, balanced and dense on the close.
This hearty red opens with aromas of wild cherry, black raspberry and chopped mint. The solid, monolithic palate offers dried cherry, star anise and coffee alongside velvety tannins. Drink through 2019.
Totally intense, perfumed, spicy and rich in botrytis honey, this is a great sweet wine. Tropical fruits are combined with lime marmalade, the concentration balanced by formidable acidity. Keep this superb wine many years.
Sharp and rustic compared to Napa and Sonoma Cabs, with green, minty tannins. There's a lot of oak, and some ripe cherry-blackberry fruit, but work remains to be done on the tannins.
The flagship of Krug's new Limited Release offerings, IX Clones refers to the nine different clones of Cabernet Sauvignon that comprise this wine. The result is more complexity than in the "regular" Limited Release Cab and a firmer, chewier finish that suggests cellaring 4-7 years prior to consumption. It's full and creamy-textured on the palate, with aromas and flavors that hint at smoke, cassis, tobacco, cedar and a multitude of dried spices. Should be great, starting in 2010. Only problem? Just 75 cases were produced.
Slightly grassy herbal-leaning plum and berry aromas include a note of pencil shavings. This feels solid and not too heavy. Roasted berry and cassis flavors don't vary or evolve in front of a slightly reedy tasting finish. Drink this maturing, middle-aged Malbec through 2019.
Frankly as sweet as Port, with sugary blackberry jam and chocolate-covered raisin flavors and high, brandied alcohol. Not bad for a dessert wine, but inappropriate for a table wine.
This herb-laced wine comes from a 1,100-feet elevation outpost five miles from the ocean and shows both feral notes and robust fruit. Tart cranberry flavor dominates, complemented by orange peel nuances. Its tannins are in full force, calling for more time in the glass if not in the cellar. Best the second day after opening, if one can wait.
This is a full-bodied, sturdy wine, bursting with blueberries and baking spices. Licorice adds interest, as do some savory notes of meat, olive and espresso. Drink 2016–2023.
Wheaty and yeasty on the nose, this becomes clearer and more focused on the palate and finish. The mouthfeel is round and solid, while the flavor profile folds in a maderized tone, with cherry and raspberry notes and mild bitterness.
This wine is a blend of Grenache (46%), Cinsault (31%) and Counoise. A very pretty pale peach color, it offers quite light aromas of strawberry and watermelon. The flavors are sleek and light, capped off by a tart finish.
Jammy and fruit forward, this has intense notes of strawberry, blueberry and plum flesh throughout. The lively palate is bright and juicy, ending with an easy, mouthwatering finish. Mevushal.
Earthy aromas of underbrush, game, overripe berry and tilled soil lead the nose on this soulful wine. The palate offers the same gamy note alongside spiced blackberry, blueberry, orange zest and clove. Firm but fine-grained tannins provide support.
Just one whiff of this wine reveals an intoxicating perfume of wildflower honey marked with zesty, fresh orange peel. An intensely concentrated honey elixir, it ripples persistently on the palate with a brilliant spray of Meyer lemon juice and a rich, vanilla cream note.
Smooth on the bouquet, with papaya, melon and other more neutral fruit aromas. The palate shows a teaspoon or two of sugary sweetness, while melon, mango and ripe apple flavors fill things out. A pleasant wine with a lightly candied way to it. Simple and basic, and decidedly not bitter.
A very aromatic wine, smoothly textured. Flavors of yellow fruits are spiced up by vanilla from the wood aging. The acidity is light, and almost lost in this rich wine.
Soft, plush and modern, this is a superstar Brunello with all the qualities we love in this gorgeous category of wine. Made from organically farmed fruit, it offers amazing intensity and determination with aromas of spice, blackberry and currants. The texture is smooth and silky and the tannins offer a solid backbone.
Nice cherry and raspberry aromas work the front end, while the palate is defined by simple but ripe berry and red plum flavors. This easy-going Cab works the red-fruit end of the spectrum, and there's just enough complexity throughout to push it to the next level.
To me, Glen Eldon's Dry Bore Shiraz exemplifies many of the positive attributes of Barossa Shiraz. The blackberry fruit is powerful, complemented by copious vanilla and toast notes from oak maturation. There's plenty of weight and concentration, but no excessively dry or hard tannins—in fact, it's almost silky. Finally, there's the promise of leathery complexity to come, all at a realistic price.
Fermented and aged in neutral French oak with full malolactic fermentation, the aromas are light, with notes of green apple and mineral. The freshly squeezed lemon acids are tart and racy, capped off by a lightly creamy finish. Pair it with food to see it at its best.
The aromas are bright, with notes of melon, pear and herb. It drinks dry, with tart lemony flavors. The concentration doesn't seem all there.
Half and half Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, this Champagne is bone dry in the Lombard style. It is also rich and full of fruit that balances the dryness with a ripe character. Citrus fruit and a tight line of acidity give a crisp edge. It could benefit from a few more months before drinking, so wait until 2017.
Shyly aromatic at first, this beautiful Primitivo blended with 8% Barbera offers smooth layers of raspberry and just-ripe cherry, a seasoning of kitchen herbs and spice sprinkled in between. Not aged in barrels, it's all about the fruit and spice and the interplay in between, with no oak to interfere.
Very soft and approachable, but perhaps a bit too soft—it's almost pillowy, with a mouthfeel like marshmallow. Good black cherry fruit dominates the core. But the wine seems a bit light, lacking in grip and conviction, at least compared with the Grace vineyard bottling.
Lots of zippy acidity in this dry, full-bodied Charbono. It's tannic and earthy, with tobacco-laced blackberry and mushroom flavors and something grilled and meaty. Bone dry, it should develop over many years, without gaining a great deal of complexity.
Quite cherry-like in the nose. On the palate, it's smooth and fairly silky, packing more bright cherry flavors, tinged with vanilla and spice. A bit peppery on the finish. Not complex, but quite pleasant.
Heavy, rubbery aromas of iodine and damp cellar are earthy but not fully convincing. Like many Michel Rolland wines, this is huge, spongy and tannic, with maximum extraction. Massive, grapy flavors of black fruits and bacon finish herbal, minty and tannic to an extreme. Drink through 2019.
A laser-focused nose of lime zest, limestone and a hint of orange blossom characterize this very refreshing sparkler. The bubbles dance across the tongue with lean, not lush flavors of orange peel and squeezed citrus.
A fat wine, reflecting the hot 2003 vintage. Highlights on the palate are toast and some grassy character from the Sauvignon Blanc. Finishes big and rich.
This Chardonnay wants time to warm and breathe in the glass, so don't pour it right from the fridge. After a little while it develops considerably in generosity, offering waves of tropical fruits, peaches and pears. The oak is pretty strong, even jarring. Give it a few years in the cellars to let everything knit together.
This is mostly Tempranillo, with smaller portions of Grenache, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot in the blend. There is plenty of acidity, some subtle suggestions of blood and fresh herb, along with pale berry fruit and soft tannins.
Marked by struck flint and petrol notes on the nose, this medium-bodied wine is the most richly textural of Franklin Estate's three single-vineyard wines. Crushed stone and citrus notes linger through the finish.
Aromatically stunning, with opulent, effusive aromas of lychee, honey, preserved peaches and spice cake. The palate has good acidity and a silky texture while the finish is long and dry. Try with a Vietnamese noodle dish. Drink now to 2011.
This organic wine, produced with a natural and biodynamic approach, is an interesting blend of 30% Syrah, 20% Grenache, 10% Mourvèdre, 10% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Merlot, 10% Malbec and 10% Marselan. It offers pronounced earthy characteristics, as well as a citrusy kick (like tangerine oil) to the blueberry and blackberry fruit core. The mouthfeel is creamy and velvety, with plush tannins and lingering baking-spice flavors.
Comes down on Petite Sirah's rustic, slightly sweet side. Even though the alcohol is pretty high, there's a sugary, porty finish to the blackberry and cherry jam flavors. The wine also has the bigtime tannins you expect from this variety, and should age for several years.
This straightforward sparkler has a hay and lemon nose. The flavors are fruity but not cloying, and turn drier on the finish. The creamy texture and soft fizziness of this likeable bubbly hit all the right notes for mass appeal, including a lively, jazzy bottle.
Made with 70% Nebbiolo and 30% Vespolina, this vibrant red offers enticing, ethereal scents of perfumed berry, fragrant blue flower, aromatic herb and a whiff of cedar. The mid-weight, luminous palate delivers crushed red cherry, raspberry, cinnamon and white pepper. Racy acidity lifts the finish while polished tannins provides support.
This pink sweet sparkler (made with fragrant Moscato grapes) opens with an intense bouquet of raspberry, jasmine and honey. It's a blush wine with a soft, foamy finish.
This has particularly ripe and concentrated fruit flavors and a feeling of alcoholic strength in the body and on the finish. Aromas and flavors resemble very ripe plums, dried cherries and blackberries. It's styled for fans of power and ripeness.
Predominantly Viognier, this wood-aged wine tastes of juicy toast at this stage. There are some perfumed characters underneath the wood, and peach flavors emerge as the wine opens.
Alamos takes Merlot to the next level with this ripe, jammy, crusty offering. The black fruit on the nose is dense and pure, the mouthfeel is round and generous, and the flavors of ripe plum and berry ring true. Layered, long and easygoing on the finish. Very nice for Argentinean Merlot.
This wine's sharp, charred oak aroma grabs one's attention, while its bold smoky, meaty flavors accent ripe blackberry and dried plum notes on the palate. An assertive Cabernet sure to please oak aficianados.
After a couple of off years, this bottling is back on form. The Porty edge is gone, and in its place is a gorgeously ripe wine with full control over the fruit. Raspberries, cherries, cassis, pecan pie, pumpkin pie, cocoa, gingerbread, cola, vanilla, Asian spice; the list goes on and on. Meanwhile the mouthfeel is pure velvet, the finish long-lasting. This is Dry Creek Valley Zin at its best.
The nose promises so much that it's not surprising when the flavors overdeliver. The aromas include intoxicating rose, stargazer lily and apricot brandy. Next, the viscous palate combines buttered bread, hard orange candy and powerful vanilla. There's not a lot of acidity and the result is nearly cloying.
Here's a fruity red wine from Sardinia with rich flavors of black cherry, prunes, blackberry, spice and a very slight hint of tobacco. The wine glides smoothly over the palate thanks to its easygoing, soft tannins. Pair it with pasta or easy home cooked meals.
Bailly Lapierre regards this full-bodied rich Pinot Noir as its signature wine. It has a cool, northern feel to it, but it also has powerful red-berry fruits, a firm structure, a final layer of acidity and a sense this is a wine as well as a Crémant.
Here's what made Zin famous to begin with. It's a big, dark, rich wine that's bursting with ripe, juicy berry and spice flavors, and is very dry. Has an instant appeal, with its fine, sweet tannins.
With fruit sourced from the excellent Hyland Vineyard, this blends a pair of Dijon clones and was aged in half new French oak for 15 months. Black cherry and cola syrup flavors combine in a sappy, concentrated midpalate. Highlights of underbrush and balsamic add flavor interest, and the dry, polished tannins frame the flavors perfectly. There's every reason to believe this can age well, but why wait?
This variety is a relative rarity in Washington. This one offers quiet aromas of spice and cherry along with barrel accents. The tart cherry flavors are medium bodied and fruit filled.
Light tones of citrus and peach color an easy Brut Prosecco Superiore that would work nicely with barbecue shrimp in sesame sauce. The acidity in this light sparkler keeps the palate clean.
A blend of bio-dynamically grown Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this opens with aromas of ripe black fruit, blue flowers, espresso, grilled herbs and baking spice. The bright palate delivers blackberry extract, spiced blueberry, tobacco, coffee, sage and licorice. Firm tannins provide the framework. Drink 2016–2022.
This huge, ripe wine is packed with sweet fruit and a sense of structure. It is concentrated and intense and has good aging potential for the next four or five years.
This is a deeply golden and saturated Greco that offers the structure and consistency to pair with white meat, pasta or shellfish. It offers subtle flavors of butterscotch and dried apricot as well.
Formerly the Goldschmidt vineyard, Winderlea is under new ownership, and has been replanted. This is a light vintage, but beautifully rendered here, with sweet cherry fruit, bracing acidity and a lively mouthfeel that invites further sipping. The underlying minerality carries a hint of toasted cracker.
Medicinal and saline aromas lead the nose. The medicinal—almost chemical—sensation carries over to the lean palate while raspy tannins leave a grainy finish.
Mineral dust scents accent ripe cherries in this medium-bodied offering from American Gary Andrus. Smooth and well structured on the midpalate, turning spicy and briary on the finish. Imported by Gypsy Dancer Estates.
Super-fruity, offering a burst of chocolate-inspired cherries, raspberries and sweet, smoky vanilla and cedar. Fortunately, all this richness is balanced by fine tannins and acids. A lush wine to drink now, from a producer to keep your eye on.
Aromas of cherry, baking spices, cocoa and herbs are followed by dark fruit and vanilla flavors with a creamy feel. It's a bit oak-driven but overall it works.
Heavily charred and roasted throughout, with a blackened nose. The palate is broad and chewy, with thick tannins and roasted, ripe flavors of blackberry, licorice and bitter chocolate. Remains severely toasted all the way to the final drop; aged in 80% new French oak (apparently fully toasted oak).
Forced oak and grassy core aromas make for a challenging, slightly green and resiny bouquet. This feels thick and heavy, with oaky, stewy flavors of ripe raspberry and black plum.
Not a bad value. The wine is a touch reduced and short on mouthfeel and aromatics, but it still delivers creamy vanilla flavors, raspberry essence and decent density. The sum of all its parts is better than the individual components. Best now, and in casual settings.
Balboa offers a fine line-up of pure varietal wines at moderate prices. This Syrah is the star of the current releases, with sharply defined black cherry candy fruit holding down center court. There are herbal notes (thyme, rosemary) and a pleasing juiciness in the mouth. Coffee, licorice and black pepper run through the polished finish.
Light aromas of cocoa, herb, licorice and barrel spice are followed by medium-bodied cherry flavors. The finish seems a bit clipped.
A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Petit Verdot, this robust wine opens with aromas of leafy underbrush, mature plum, toast and roasted coffee bean. The palate offers prune, dried cherry, black pepper, graphite and espresso alongside dusty tannins, with the heat of alcohol on the midpalate.
Extremely delicate on the nose, this wine from the historic vineyard shows bruised yellow grapefruit, sliced nectarine and crushed chalk aromas. The evolving palate starts daintily with cut apple and nectarine, then warms into seared peach, buttered popcorn and ripe pear flavors. A chalky, seashell-like structure and pithy texture ensure a long, interesting life. Drink 2018 through 2034.
There's too much oak for too little fruit in this wine, with the result that it tastes of sappy, smoky toothpicks. Buried under all that wood are modest apricot and pineapple flavors.
Soft, full-bodied and stuffed with baked blackberry, cherry, raspberry and chocolate flavors, this big, rather hot wine has a bit of superripe sweetness in the finish. Yet it pulls it all off with aplomb and manages to stay balanced.
Mild citrus and raspberry aromas are appropriate for this light-colored, light-bodied Pinot. A medium-sized palate is balanced and hints at elegance, while true-to-Leyda flavors of pie cherry and red plum are peppery on the finish, which brings hints of vanilla and wood grain.
Quite green and minty, and that unripe, herbal streak continues onto the palate, where bell pepper takes over. Lean and clean on the finish, however, to such a point that it simply disappears.
Aromas of underbrush, sea breeze, crushed herb, toast and leather lead the way on this earthy, refined red. On the palate, star anise, clove, grilled sage and a hint of game add depth to the black cherry core. Polished, silky tannins provide the framework while a saline note closes the finish. Drink through 2021.
This is a gorgeous expression of the variety, co-fermented with 6% Viognier, fruity, ripe and plush yet also completely varietal in its punches of floral white pepper, anise and gamy meat. Although the wine is ready to enjoy now, those who can restrain themselves should cellar it through 2022 to see how it further develops.
Roasted and fiery on the nose, this wine has red fruit aromas mixed with green, herbal notes. It feels racy and pumped up with acidity, which drives the wine's core flavors of red plum, herb and vanilla. It's fresh but slightly abrasive and herbal throughout. This is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah and Tempranillo, in descending order.
Supple and forward, just the way a good rosso should be, with cherry and tobacco aromas and flavors backed up by a plump mouthfeel and a long, softly tannic finish. Good value.
You can smell a hint of ginger spice in the bouquet of this wine, presumably from the splash of Gewürz in this Chenin- and Chardonnay-dominant blend. Otherwise, notes of yellow peach, toasted brioche and ripe melon abound, with a good acidic lift to the close to keep things fresh.
Smooth and rich, its tannins are buried in the ripe, sumptuous fruit. It's packed with red-berry, wild-strawberry and raspberry flavors, along with intense and juicy acidity. The structure does have a dry edge that promises aging, although the wine is very ready to drink now.
The three castas (grapes) in the blend are Chardonnay, Arinto and Vital. It is a clean, fresh wine that is soft and round. The Chardonnay acidity lifts the two Portuguese grapes. This lightly textured wine is ready to drink now.
The fragrant and flavorful nose's butter, lychee and banana aromas create an alluring opening. Pink grapefruit and tropical fruit flavors accent a sweetly spicy, baked-apple mouth that has medium weight and a nice texture. The wine finishes dry and nutty, with moderate length. Smoky and lush, it's ready to drink tonight.
Round and fruity, it has flavors of ripe Bartlett pear, creamy green apple, white peach and apricot. It's perfect to pour as an apéritif or pair it with starters and light first courses.
Tight, young and somewhat impenetrable, this pure Cabernet from the estate vineyard on Red Mountain is tannic and sharp. The fruit shows cherry and cassis, and the alcohol (listed at 14.9%) is mostly contained. But it's a hard wine, and does not seem to have the complex aromatics that promise more detail with age. Drink it now, for its pure, young fruit and match it to a thick, juicy steak.
Ripe and fruity, this has a rich texture that comes both from the generous white fruits and from the cut of lemon acidity. A mineral-textured wine, it's crisp now and will likely round out to bring out the ripeness. Drink from 2019.
Despite being heavy and flat, this is an easygoing wine with raisiny notes on the nose and earthy, loamy berry and raisin flavors. The finish is soft, with nothing jagged or hard to deal with.
Here is a dark and beautifully intense Rosso di Montalcino with penetrating notes of black cherry, plum, prune, spice and leather. It's a sophisticated and food-friendly wine from one of the most beautiful wine-producing territories on earth.
This is a structured wine, with solid tannins and ample woody flavors. But it has the fruit weight to sustain the structure, offering a wine that promises good aging as well as short-term attractive fruitiness.
Morgan has hit its stride with this unoaked Chardonnay. Nothing comes between the intense citrus, pineapple, white peach, apple and spice flavors and your palate. Cleansing acidity boosts it all and makes the wine star-bright. Morgan leads the pack of California unoaked Chards.
Earthy, spicy aromas lead, rolling into smoky layers of typical Cab flavors. Berry, tobacco and touches of sweet oak give it okay complexity.
Oceanic and crisp smelling, with green apple, citrus and light oak on the nose. Has roundness and weight, but juiciness as well. Tastes a touch sweet and syrupy, with tropical fruit flavors. Chunky and a little sticky on the finish despite boasting a solid acid level.
This wine is a blend of Art Den Hoed Petite Sirah (80%) and Gunkel Vineyard Zinfandel. Aromas of barrel spice, vanilla, raspberry and purple fruit are followed by full-bodied palate-coating fruit flavors, brightened by fresh acidity. The interest is as much about feel as flavor.
From a warm, inland region, this is nevertheless a fine value. It's rich and full-bodied without being over the top, offering spice-accented notes of peach, apricot and pineapple. Drink now.
This deep garnet-colored wine proffers fragrances of black cherry and dark plum with a flourish of green pepper. It is smooth on the palate, with silky tannins and flavors of black cherry, raspberry, Mediterranean herbs and licorice. A mélange of bright berries and smoky spice permeates the sleek finish.
Aromas of grapefruit, herb and almonds open to a mouthful of melon and peach in this medium-weight dry white.  It has a bit more texture than most Vernaccias, a clean, crisp finish and an attractive back perfume with a touch of bitter almond.
King Estate consistently delivers, and this is a delicious, creamy, textural wine. Full-throttle fruit combines lemon, lime, pineapple and candied citrus rind, underscored by refreshing minerality. Give it a slight chill and drink now through 2020.
Broad and pleasing aromas of yellow melon, sliced lemons, white peach and apple make for a chameleon-like nose mixing ripeness with restraint. Honeydew and cantaloupe flavors make for a plush palate, quite delicious although not too flashy.
This lovely metodo classico sparkling wine is made entirely from Chardonnay grapes. It has a creamy texture that delivers sensations of peach and honey, with notes of cream-filled pastries and almond. It finishes crisp and clean.
Firm and complex, it manages both acidity and concentrated tannins and brings out really black fruits.
Undoubtedly an ambitious effort, Albrecht's Amplus is an impressively extracted Pinot that ends up coming across as too woody and too tannic for its modest cherry fruit. Lots of vanilla, cedar and caramel if you like that sort of thing.
Here's a pure expression of the hearty Montepulciano grape with bright berry flavors, thick extraction and a chewy, succulent texture. It's sticky and jammy-sweet in places and thick on the palate.
Nectarine and fig notes mark the nose, while the palate is mellow and well-ripened, then delivers a refreshing citrusy kick on the long, grapefruit finish. Drink this medium-bodied wine over the next 6–9 months.
One of the first wines from De Loach after the Boisset takeover, this dry Gewürz is a good portent for the future. It's ultraclean and crisp, with very deep and satisfying flavors of Asian spices, peaches, litchi and citrus.
Seductive floral aromas are jazzed up by healthy red-fruit scents, and once you get to the mouth the wine becomes precise and tight. This is a defined Brunello with clear plum and black cherry flavors that are sweetened by hints of almond candy and red licorice. Sturdy, mildly tannic and full. Should be just right in about three years. Imported by Folio.
The typical field blend from Vienna, full and deliciously spicy. It has elegance and style, a wine that waltzes across the palate, offering hints of lychee, pear and crisp citrus all finely integrated by tangy acidity. Screw cap.
This spicy and well-balanced wine has a light salmon color, subtle aromas like cinnamon and cherries, and flavor accents resembling cranberries, paprika and ginger. It's light to medium bodied, has very fine bubbles and a lingering finish.
Basic aromas of spiced plum, cassis and black cherry set up a similar set of flavors, while the feel is pure, clean and easygoing. This is a no-nonsense, familiar type of mass-market Cabernet. It's generic in its approach and it doesn't vary much along the way.
Starts with aromas of beef jerky, licorice and berry syrup. It's a brawny, dark wine with jammy blackberry flavors along with chocolate cake and thick, grabbing tannins. Finishes sweet and syrupy, with heavy saturation and big tannins. Not in perfect balance and by no means a great wine from Mauro. But it's still good for an off year. A Europvin, Christopher Cannan selection, Imported by multiple importers, including Michael Skurnik Wines.
Dark colored, highly perfumed wine, packing rich fruit with its ripe, chunky structure. Black berries give a juicy character, taming the acidity, and allowing the wood smoke to wreath around the wine. Age for at leasy six years, but this can withstand more.
There's a rich vein of green olives in this wine, alongside the blackberries, cocoa and toast. With smooth, brisk tannins, it's best opened over the next 2–3 years.
Ripe berry and oaky vanilla aromas lead to a tight, tannic palate with some scrape to it. Dark, toasty, oak-based flavors of coffee rest on top of plum and currant. It's full on the finish, with a lasting note of toasty oak.
This medium-bodied wine has an earthy edge and a good core of cherry and plum flavors. A touch of barnyard in the aroma, and earthy, leathery flavors accompany a very smooth and relatively light mouthfeel.
Freshly cut green pears and crunchy, ripe apples have immediate appeal. This fruity freshness continues on the sleek and super-clean palate, which leads to a refreshing, long finish.
Green bell pepper and cedar aromas lead the nose of this easy-drinking blend of Syrah, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. The aromas carry over to the fresh palate, along with black currants and black cherries. Supple tannins support the juicy flavors.
This refreshing sparkling wine made mostly from Pinot Noir grapes has a light-gold color and slightly toasted or earthy aromas. It feels lively and frothy in texture, nicely crisp in balance, and medium bodied. Ripe apple and peach flavors emerge with each sip.
Made from Syrah, Lagrein and Petite Sirah, this is a rustic red. It has lots of rich raspberry, cherry and cola flavors, but feels rough in texture. Drink now with everyday fare.
A Rhône-style blend that's rich in cola, blackberry and cherry jam and oak flavors. The tannins are fine and ripe, while acidity is on the soft side, giving the wine a certain directness. Yet it's nicely dry and clean. Drink now.
Aromas of underbrush, scorched earth, game, woodland berry and a balsamic note lead the nose. The youthful, tightly wound palate offers black cherry, crushed raspberry, anise, chopped herb, clove and tobacco alongside firm, noble tannins and bright acidity. Oliver McCrum Wines and Petit Pois.
This is singer/songwriter John Legend's inaugural wine project in conjunction with Raymond Vineyards in the Napa Valley. Combining 85% Cabernet Sauvignon with 15% Petit Verdot, it tells a powerful story in thick layers of blackberry cobbler, chocolate and coffee, the tannin and oak integrated and silky smooth. This is a wine of great presence.
A blend of white grapes Vermentino and Colombana, this opens with aromas yellow flower, stone fruit, and a whiff of citrus. The fresh palate offers yellow peach and tangerine that lead to a clean finish.
I've never had a Zin from this vineyard that wasn't rustic and tannic. The '04 is in that tradition. The official alcohol is only 14.3%, but it feels hot and Porty, with flavors of raisins and stewed berries, although it is fully dry.
Intensely aromatic, intensely fruity, this Riesling packs a powerful punch of flavor within a delicate frame. The fruit profile is tropical with concentrated guava and mango flavors spiced with hints of white pepper. It's semi-sweet in style, but bracing acidity leaves the finish quite dry.
For a so-called value wine, there's an awful lot of toast and oak on this baby. But that's okay, because despite the wine's almondy, sugary aromas and flavors, it has the body and acidity to handle it all. And along the way there are flavors of mango, orange and green banana as well as modest but present citrus zest. A big-production wine (270,000 cases) that satisfies.
From Michael Mondavi's portfolio, this affordable Cabernet is concentrated in red berry and savory leather, a nod to the small amounts of Syrah and Petite Sirah that are included in the blend. French oak provides a hint of vanilla and cardamom, while the medium-bodied palate and attractive finish is washed in coffee.
A powerful specimen that plows straight ahead on the bouquet, dealing out whiffs of rubber, smoke and hickory along the way. Meaty feeling and deep, with roasted blackberry, woodspice and bitter chocolate flavors. Dark and chocolaty on the finish, with a note of bacon.
You'll find a rich vein of cherries, red currants and cedar, leading to a dry, spicy finish, but the velvety smoothness you want in a fine Merlot is what it lacks.
The nose is still closed but the palate reveals yellow mirabelle plum notes enlivened by lemon freshness. This is fruit-driven and refreshing with a slender, easy body that has a dry, lively finish.
Chunky, lightly vegetal, green-fruit aromas are authentic for Casablanca SB. This has a full, slightly oily feel with girth and weight. Punchy, tart citrus and green-fruit flavors finish with lime, bell pepper and jalapeño notes.
The third vintage of the Beringer senior winemaker's namesake bottling is robust, yet approachable. This wine is lavishly—to some, overly oaked, but it's one of the best of this style. Apple, cinnamon bun, and smoke aromas give way to caramel, vanilla and spice flavors. Add a rich, round mouthfeel, and you've got a very seductive package. This wine is more about vigorous style, flavor and texture than subtlety. Only die-hard anti-oaksters will be able to resist its appeal.
Enormously rich and sweet in jammy blackberries and cherries, sprinkled with brown sugar and cinnamon spice, this wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot. You can taste that famous Paso Robles sun in every sip, but the wine is a bit too high in alcohol, giving it warmth on the finish.
Some light Graham cracker aromas come up quickly, but in the mouth the wine all but disappears. Watery and thin, it shows little promise of further improvement.
With a buttered popcorn aroma and butterscotch flavors, this wine is flashy with oak character. Soft in texture, it's low in acidity and full in body.
Big, powerful wine, full of both tannins and fruit. Being a 2008, the structure is firm and up-front, with the fruit and acidity lying behind. It will need to age for 2–3 years and more to come into balance.
Made with certified organically grown grapes, this value blend of Sangiovese (80%), Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon opens with jammy fruit tones of cherry or blackberry confiture and plush spice and tobacco notes. There's a moist, chewy quality to this wine and a subtle touch of sweetness, too.
Sweet cherry aromas turn medicinal on the nose. A bright and lively palate has a fast pulse, while forward berry flavors fade with spice and mild chocolate notes.
Lots of almost sweet blackberry and cherry fruit in this dryish wine. It's a bit too soft in tannins and acids, and collapses on the finish, except for the intense fruit, which lingers.
This opens with some funky, earthy aromas that soon blow off to reveal scents of leather, truffle, eucalyptus, berry and meat juices. The palate shows dark cherry, raspberry, pipe tobacco and balsamic notes and big, ripe tannins. This reflects the forward vintage, so drink now.
Slightly citric on the nose, with bouncy, edgy fruit flavors of strawberry and raspberry. It's a lightweight with as much tea and citrus as there is beef, bulk and familiar Cabernet characteristics. More like a fruit drink than serious wine.
Nearly a year in bottle after disgorgement has given this a toasty character. The acidity and the citrus fruits are still there, but they have been seamlessly integrated into the mature flavors. It's a light style, delicate and elegant.
For the price, this is a good deal in a rich California Chardonnay from a major producer. The wine is dry and crisp, with rich flavors of citrus fruits, peaches, mangoes and honeysuckle, and the minerally edge that a Calera Chardonnay usually shows.
A bright, fresh, spritely nose leads on this approachable white. Clean and fruity with a lively citrus backbone, it has character and an easy-drinking style that make it good for everyday sipping.
Aromas of scorched earth, mature dark fruit, dark cooking spice and a whiff of leather emerge on this structured wine. The brooding palate delivers black cherry, raspberry, clove, baking spice, anise and chopped herb alongside firm, ripe tannins and fresh acidity. Give it a few more years to fully open. Drink after 2019.
A well-made blend of 45% Cabernet Sauvignon, 41% Merlot, 8% Cabernet Franc, 5% Petit Verdot and 1% Barbera, this value wine is a stunner with black cherry, plum and cassis notes surprisingly spiced with accents of mint and flint. Creamy in the mouth with medium-grain tannins and a solid finish.
The first wine I've had from the new vintage is clean, crisp and totally enjoyable. It has a raw, juicy quality, like biting into a fresh lime, and is dry, with a long, citrus-and-vanilla aftertaste.
Generous orange and ripe, red apple meet with the zesty freshness of tangerine peel in this wine. It's dry but fresh, with bouncy, joyful fruitfulness. The super-clean finish is lip-smacking.
A proportion of the grapes in this wine, accented with 2% Merlot and 1% Cabernet Franc, comes from the Lewis Vineyard, a respected site in the heart of the appellation. It contributes to the magic, putting forward red currant, sage and crisp red fruit around a strong body, texture and tang of tannin.
The bouquet resembles fresh apple cider. There's more apple and the addition of citrus on the palate, while the finish is ripe, fruity and soft. More chunky than upright.
Of all the Cavas made by Freixenet, this oddly sweet Spumante is the weakest. This is briny, pickled and candied on the nose, with hints of lychee and banana. Flavors of Sprite, cane sugar and banana finish with sulfur, honeydew and a faux kiwi note.
Heavy as dead weight, with a raisiny nose. Only dried out, semisalty plum flavors work the palate.
Underbrush, cured meat, new leather, camphor and a whiff of cellar floor are some of the aromas you'll find on this. On the firm palate, notes of grilled sage, anise and espresso accent a red-cherry core alongside austere tannins that grip the finish. Drink 2020–2028.
Big and with some sweetness, this is a full vintage wine from a great year. There is freshness, but the wine is dominated by ripe fruit touched by caramel and has a rich, toasty aftertaste.
A lot of detectable oak here with earthy, cooked fruit and a flat overlay of barrel. In general, something seems missing.
This is one of Chile's best Chardonnays. It's made in the deep south of the country, where it's very cool. The result is a zesty, acidic wine, but one with a lot of tropical flavors such as pineapple, lemon and melon. Well balanced and real, with a pleasant streak of oak running through the citrusy finish. Imported by Metrowine Distribution.
Mellow and melony up front, with a plump, bland palate featuring mealy melon and peach flavors. The finish has a touch of bitterness.
This has creamy flavors of vanilla, honey, lime and orange.
Minimal wood aging does not interfere with Viognier's natural floral aromas. There are plenty of sweet-smelling spring flowers with layers of citrus and cracked white pepper. Don't pair this wine with a neutral food: go with aromatic dishes, like fish in a basil pesto sauce.
Closed and firm at this early stage, the wine from Jean-Michel Bergeron has good potential. It is rich with plenty of black-currant fruit as well as dry tannins. Give this wine its time and wait until 2019.
For all this wine's ripeness and heat (16% abv), the aromas are surprisingly delicate, offering up strawberry and raspberry fruit compote. It's full in body, with supple tannins, hints of chocolate and touches of spice and warmth on the finish. Drink now.
A bit heavy for a coastal Pinot Noir, but tasty, this single-vineyard bottling shows ripe, juicy flavors of raspberries, cherry preserves, cola and vanilla-infused oak. It's lush and appealing and at its best now with a good steak.
A superb wine, the tannins carrying along the dense structure with ease and grace. The purity of the ripe berry fruit is very marked, with acidity giving freshness to the sweet wine. The whole ensemble is developing well, but will need many years' aging.
This is a strongly flavored blush, packing a punch of raspberry, fig, sweet tea and rose flavors. It's dry and very crisp in acidity. Give it a chill and enjoy with salted, smoked meats, or a nice fish stew.
An excellent effort, this deserves its “limited” designation, and not just because it's a three-barrel selection. Dense raspberry and black cherry anchor a substantial wine with plenty of well-ripened tannins. Spending 22 months in one-quarter new French oak adds streaks of dark chocolate and espresso. The acid-tannin balance is spot-on.
Freshly cut green pear mingles with ripe white currant in a restrained but fresh and focused body that also reveals numerous shades of pear fruit. In Styria, the local name for Chardonnay is Morillon.
Fragrant, with a floral lift in the nose, this is loaded with rich fruit flavors of pineapple, peach and citrus. A whiff of toast and just-sawn wood leads into a lengthy, beautifully balanced, tongue-coating finish.
Marimar's first Albariño is unquestionably one of the best ever to hail from California. Made without oak, it's modest in alcohol, giving it a light, transparent mouthfeel that transmits pure, bone dry flavors of peaches, grapefruits and guava, with a touch of Sauvignon Blanc-like gooseberry and enough acidity to make the palate whistle. A real beauty, especially with Asian fusion fare.
The alcohol certainly gives the wine richness, but it manages to sustain it well, with superripe black plum and damson flavors, dusty tannins and a powerful texture that rolls richly around the mouth. It leaves a sweet and juicy aftertaste like old-style Rioja.
A nice nose of black and blue berries with a hint of leather opens this value Syrah. Well built, it shows a bit of chocolate and decent length. There’s just a touch of green herb in there and it closes dry with fairly full tannins.
Hints of toast from wood aging give this wine its richness. It doesn't detract from the ripe apricot and peach fruit flavors while also keeping great freshness. All the elements have produced a ripe, full wine that could still age another year. Drink from 2017.
This is a mineral-driven wine, austere at first then showing great black fruits that are sustained by acidity. It's a wood-aged and complex wine that is likely to develop into something powerful and impressive. Drink from 2019.
Like all of Melville's new 2011 Pinot Noirs, this bottling is powerful and forward in cherries, raspberries and Dr. Pepper cola, alongside earthier mushroom and earth notes. It's a beautiful wine that shows the classy elegance of a well-grown Santa Rita Pinot, with brisk acids and firm but fine tannins. Drink now–2017 for maximum freshness.
Incredibly dense and rich, this just rocks with luscious aromas and flavors of cherry pie, anise, mushroom and sandalwood. It feels so vital on the palate, offering real complexity and intellectual interest, as it reveals different aspects of its personality with each moment. Decant this beauty for an hour or so before serving.
88-90 Spicy, smoky character, with ripe fruit and good acidity. Black plums, and very rich. There is a touch of pepper from the alcohol.
This radiates fragrance and spice: ferns and pepper, yeast and juicy, yellow pear, mirabelle plums and aloe vera. All of this is on both the nose and the palate and is combined in a harmonious, balanced parcel of rounded goodness. It treads a fine line between opulence and freshness but does not stray from its perfect high wire act.
A blend of 75% Merlot with 25% Cabernet Franc, the wine has richness. It also has the firm dry tannins that are typical of the vintage. It is dry and solid with its black-currant fruits still developing. It needs to age further, so wait until 2018.
A touch of passion fruit plays on the nose. The palate on the other hand is full of lime and lemon zest that counters this exuberant fruit. A lovely, playful high-wire act between fruit and freshness that provides immense refreshment.
This simple wine offers up subdued sensations of raw berries and a hint of mocha but it lacks fruit richness. It's already very evolved and should be drunk soon.
This blend of Inzolia and Chardonnay has subdued aromas of orchard fruit and nut. The simple palate offers lime and citrus zest alongside brisk acidity.
This wine pops with aromas of blue and black fruit, vanilla, orange peel and cocoa. The palate is full of restrained, supple-feeling cranberry and cherry flavors that draw out on the finish.
The nose is quiet but the bright, simple palate offers lime and a hint of bitter hazelnut. It's rather lean, with brisk acidity.
Pessagno has a perfect track record with this cool-climate vineyard, consisently producing Chards of this caliber. The wine is tight in acids and flinty minerals, even showing new oaky tannins. But the exotic nuances of roasted peaches and grilled pineapples suggest cellarability. Best after 2008.
Not quite as complex as Fritz's Barrel Select Reserve, a soft, direct wine, with jammy cherry, blackberry, blueberry, tangerine, root beer, licorice, herb and spice flavors that taste a little sweet. Drink now.
Red cherry and raspberry flavors in this Cabernet Sauvignon show remarkably fresh and pure. It's a juicy, approachably fruity wine but also structured keenly by zesty acidity and fine, firm tannins. Surprisingly well balanced for a big, ripe red.
This Pinot is ripe in jammy cherry fruit, and it has a smoky, buttery richness from oak. But it's a little soft and heavy for the variety, which is perhaps to be expected given its Alexander Valley origin.
Exotic spice and savory meat tones add dimension to sultry black-fruit and fig flavors. Dry and full bodied in style, it's richly textured with a bold yet velvety tannin structure.
This Crianza has leathery aromas, a tannic mouthfeel and roasted, spicy red berry flavors. It's dry, oaky and not particularly ripe.
A Cab-based wine with 20% Merlot, this has juicy blackberry and currant to soften the overreaching tannic profile. Blessed in cedar and tobacco, this also presents a strong showing of dried herb. The fruit leans black and blue, from blueberry to black plum, a nod to the Merlot.
There's a dark and masculine quality to this Sangiovese from Romagna that makes this wine perfect for pork or breaded veal. Dark cherry and prune are backed by bright acidity.
Right up there with the rich '08, Elliott's 2009 offers plenty of serious tasting pleasure. It's rich and ripe in raspberries and cherries, with complex notes of mushrooms, cola, herbs and spices. Dry and silky, it's a classy Pinot Noir for drinking over the next several years.
Underneath the lively tropical fruit and grassiness, a creamy, smooth undertone balances the whole. The wine is a touch green in the nose and there are hints of it on the palate, but the rounded mouthfeel and body help to keep it in check. A simple but tasty everyday wine.
Dry earthy aromas of herbal raspberry and tomato are reserved in a good way. There's acidic lift to a rugged palate, while berry fruit flavors blend with spice notes prior to a tannic finish.
This is a big, ripe, oaky Pinot Noir. Considering how cold the vintage was, it was quite an achievement to produce such powerful raspberry, cherry and plum fruit flavors. The wine is dry, elegantly tailored and vibrant in acidity, and should peak by 2017.
Very spicy on the nose, this sweet wine is ripe, full bodied and fruity. It has a floral character that gives complexity as well as a delicious, refreshing aftertaste. Drink now.
Le Sughere is a well-composed wine, except for a hint of Band-Aid that blows off relatively quickly to enhance natural aromas of red fruit, root beer and toast. It offers sweet herb flavors and fresh mint on the close.
Dark to the eye, with bacon, ham, spice and savory fruit aromas. The palate is extracted and grating in feel, with dark berry, herb, pepper, smoke and barrel resin flavors. Spicy on the finish, with a blast of clove and cardamom. Very good but not as filled out as in prior years.
There are only a handful of acres of this Vitis vinifera vine left and wines like this are consequently rare, so much so that the Gueguens claim to be the only producers of 100% Sacy. This light, crisp, fruity wine is low in alcohol and bright to taste. It is ready to drink.
Although this is aimed at a slightly higher target than Beaubois's entry-level Expression cuvée, it comes across as just slightly more tannic, with a fine balance of blackberries, olives and earth on the midpalate but a touch of coarseness to the finish. 80% Syrah, 20% Grenache. Drink 2012–2015.
The lightest touch of wood gives this wine a full, rich character. Weight and density are balanced by the intense acidity. Melon, apricots and citrus are all blended in this ripe wine. Drink from 2018.
Winemaker: Gottfried Mocke. If you like herbal, minty Pinots, then this wine is definitely for you. Intense aromas of eucalyptus, rooibos tea, pomegranate, fennel bulb and currant leaf are at the forefront of the bouquet and carry through to the lifted, mentholated palate. The medium-weight palate offers fine yet structured tannins and a long, herbal finish. Drink now–2020.
Fresh aromas of carnation, framboise, cherry cola and blooming rose petals show on the nose of this bottling by Coby Parker-Garcia. Bright flavors of hibiscus tea, pomegranate and raspberry ride a clean line of crushed thyme and peppercorn dust on the lively palate.
This lush and aromatic wine has beautiful rose-petal aromas and vibrant grapefruit flavors that spread across the palate and linger nicely on the finish. Rather full bodied, it is rich enough to serve with strong cheeses and roasted birds.
Enthusiastic applause across the panel for this blockbuster wine made by superstar enologist Carlo Ferrini. Modern, concentrated and packed with plump fruit, black pepper highlights, vanilla and chewy meatiness. One panelist likened it to Californian Syrah. Does not bode well for Brunello purists, but it is a rich, powerful wine that leaves a dry, chewy finish and a huge impression in the mouth. Imported by Supreme Wines & Spirits.
From 70-year-old vines, this cedar-tinged wine reflects its maturation in one-third new oak. Brown sugar, cracked pepper and plum notes mingle easily into a pleasant, silky Cornas that should have broad appeal. Drink now–2025.
Firm and savory, this charming wine doles out aromas and flavors of underbrush, ripe blackberry, crushed dark cherry, clove and ground pepper. Supple tannins support the juicy, easy-drinking palate.
Boasting notes of dried flowers and herbs in its bouquet, this is a silky, elegant rendition of Châteauneuf-du-Pape. There's a sense of wet-stone minerality, along with notes of dried black fruit and dark chocolate. Licorice comes through on the lengthy finish.
Even with alcohol at 15.5%, this wine tastes overtly sweet. The combination is like melted cherry jam sprinkled with black pepper, cocoa and jalapeño pepper. Some folks will love it.
A blend of 20 varieties from the Mediterranean and the Caucasus, the wine's aromas are muddled: There's a bit of blackberry, plum, horsehide, cow pasture, tar and old leather in here. But this primordial brew offers a fascinating glimpse at the roots of wine.
Light in color but very flavorful, this Chardonnay-Riesling blend serves up a full nose and mouth of pineapple and spice with light herb accents. Its bright and tangy personality will take the edge off a hot evening—try it with some grilled shrimp or chicken. A touch sweet, it will also have broad appeal.
Definite richness alongside classic elegance. It's a stylish wine, the fruit integrated into a beautiful structure. It's not all refinement, because there is also a weight to the black plum skin and dark berry character. A wine that will age over many decades.
Ripe spice and lychee fruits, classic Gewürztraminer with tropical fruit, a touch of pepper and a full-bodied, intense feel. For drinking now.
Hmmm. This shows some attractive savory and spicy elements on the nose, but the fruit is limited to tart berries and the feel on the palate is lean and astringent. Drink up.
Gorgeously aromatic, this racy, light-footed wine wafts of lavender, peach and honeycomb. The palate is juicy with sweet, ripe grapefruit and apricot, yet zesty with acidity and minerality. Enamel-stripping acidity feels jagged on the finish now, but should meld out beautifully from 2019 on.
Brick in color and a bit Bordeaux-like in aromas, mouthfeel and flavors. Scents of dry herbs, tobacco and leafy red fruits are interesting and cool, while the palate mixes flavors of tobacco, dry fruit, brown sugar and herbs. Finishes with mild oak and coconut. Almost Rioja and/or Bordeaux in its overall presentation.
A halo of waxy pollen lingers over fresh peach and lemon aromas. The palate is muddled with vague stone-fruit flavors, with crisp acidity leading to a short, simple finish.
Zesty pink grapefruit, lime and lemon abound in this refreshingly spine-tingling wine. Delicately framed, it's sunny and tangerine-sweet on the midpalate, finishing spry and crisp.
A great red meat wine because of its distinctive density, extraction and power, this is redolent of red fruit, prune and plum. It finishes with an array of zesty spice nuances that range from ginger to crushed clove.
Made with dried Nebbiolo grapes grown in high mountain vineyards, this robust wine opens with aromas of ripe black fruit, spicy plum cake, Alpine herbs and a hint of prune. The full-bodied palate doles out black cherries marinated in spirits, clove, savory herb and ground black pepper alongside assertive but velvety tannins.
Dry, tannic and tartly acidic, this has the herbaceous earthiness often found in Alexander Valley Cabernets, but it's rich enough in cherries and sweet oak to satisfy. It doesn't seem like an ager, but it's an elegantly smooth wine to drink now.
Good grip and detail highlight this vineyard designate. Smoke, pipe tobacco, a whiff of cigar and a spicy edge bringing in cinnamon and clove are all well-matched to the ripe, plush fruit. Length and complexity make this a standout.
This opens with aromas that recall moist underbrush, grilled sage, menthol and a whiff of cellar floor. The brisk, diluted palate offers raw red cherry, oak and a hint of star anise alongside stinging acidity and astringent tannins that leave a raspy finish. It lacks fruit richness.
Drinkable now for its thick but ripely sweet tannins, this Cab has blue and black fruit and berry flavors, like blackberries, plums, black raspberries and cola, enhanced with spicy, charry oak. What a long, beautiful finish.
A fruity, jammy style of Cab with thick berry aromas resting in front of a full-bodied, chewy palate with forward red berry and chocolate flavors. This is smooth, not complex and easygoing proof that Argentina is not only about Malbec.
This wine is still young, crisp and needs time to bring out its fruit. It has lively acidity, to be sure, with hints of the citrus and white currant flavors that are to come. Give this wine until 2016.
So well done,  from beginning to end. The nose offers a good balance of beef, cherry, plum and black pepper notes. On the palate, it's mouthwatering, medium sized and moderately oaked—that is, there's no caramel or toast in sight. Focused; flavors of black cherry, blackberry, eucalyptus and black pepper are mouthwatering, and the tannins smooth. Imported by Wilson Daniels Ltd.
This bottling, which includes 8% Zinfandel and 3% Syrah, shows gingerbread, sandalwood, olallieberry, violet and maraschino cherry on the nose. It's delicate on the palate at first, with candied-strawberry flavors as well as cinnamon foam and purple flowers. It features a nice textural tension as well.
Not really sweet, and not entirely Riesling (the blend includes 13% Gewürztraminer and 10% Pinot Gris), this off-dry wine tastes like fresh squeezed apple juice, lightly sweetened.
Classic Laetitia, dark, dry, full-bodied and richly extracted. The cherry, persimmon and pomegranate fruit is so forward, it tastes sweet, except that the wine finishes fully dry. Acidity is evident, as are grippy tannins, and the fruit and spice finish lasts a long time. An evident ager. Best after 2013.
Emanating from the heel of the Italian boot, close to the beautiful city of Lecce, this is one of Puglia’s classic wines. The grapes are Negroamaro and Malvasia Nera. Pleasant cherry-berry aromas and flavors predominate. The structure is ample, as is the mouthfeel. The tannins need some softening. The finish is long. Grilled lamb would make a fine accompaniment.
Full bodied, rich and creamy on the palate, this is a lush Shiraz ready for immediate consumption. It delivers intense dark fruit flavors with the merest hint of raisining, ending on a chocolaty note.
Forward and jammy in blackberry, cherry, pomegranate and coffee flavors, this is certainly a rich, ripe wine, dry and balanced. As good as it is, this single-clone Pinot seems a bit one-dimensional.
This includes grapes from the winery's Jerusalem Hill vineyard in the Eola-Amity Hills AVA, in addition to the Dundee Hills sites, hence the more general Willamette Valley designation. It was aged in 65% new French oak for 16 months. It's open and generous, offering bright berry, cherry and red currant fruit matched to defining acids, all set in a fine-tuned frame of new oak. Re-tasted 24 hours after being opened, it remained fresh, dense and satisfying.
Delicate scents of yellow fruit and acacia flower float from the glass. The vibrant palate offers green apple, lemon and lime framed in bracing acidity and a firm, persistent perlage.
A blend of 51% Viognier and 49% Traminer, this wine is made with organic grapes. It has aromas of jasmine and guava flowers and lush tropical flavors of mango and freshly cut guava.
Crème caramel and spice aromas are exotically appealing on this bright, full-bodied Chardonnay. Dry in style with zesty acidity and fresh apple flavor, the palate is a bit more subtle than the nose, but makes this a straightforward drinker.
This shows fresh, crisp apple and lemon-cream aromas, with clean appley flavors and buttery accents. Medium bodied, it tends toward the soft, rather than crisp, side. Lively fruit flavors make it refreshing.
Varietal Graciano is something we frequently see, and very rarely does it bowl us over. This wine has jumpy cherry and lemon peel aromas, and the flavors are tight, a touch sour and run toward cherry and red plum. Fruity for certain, but lacking in charm and mouthfeel.
Crisp and refreshing, this opens with scents recalling citrus, cranberry and aromatic herb. The vibrant palate delivers fresh strawberry, sour cherry, nectarine and a note of white pepper alongside racy acidity a vivacious but refined perlage.
Pristine Asian pear and lemon perfume on the nose of this full bodied Chardonnay take a slightly darker savory tone on the palate. The mouthfeel is rich and textured, but brambly slightly vegetal notes and a bite of astringency distract on the finish.
This delves into the more sanguine side of California's historic yet stylistically versatile grape, with rare meat and red earth aromas. On the tart palate is pomegranate and cranberry, with bay leaf and kalamata olives giving an herbal lift.
From Don Sebastiani & Sons, a dramatically ripe, concentrated Cabernet, with fine, firm tannins framing blackberry, blueberry and cassis flavors. Really easy to drink now, and the price is quite good for the quality.
Stalky, lightly vegetal aromas come with notes of match stick and bitterness. This feels fresh in the mouth but tastes briny, with citrus, jalapeño and green bean accents. A bland, pithy finish feels round. Drink now.
Extremely delicate and soft in terms of its aromatic intensity, this Prosecco Brut offers a graceful and precise embroidery of foamy, light peach fruit and spring flowers. Yet the sparkler is quite effective in the mouth thanks to its refreshing acidity and perky bubbling.
Touches of sage and tarragon breathe freshness into succulent red cherry and berry aromas on this rich, full-bodied Cabernet Franc. The palate shows off pure, pristine red fruit, jolted by a shock of cranberry acidity and a lingering wet-granite finish.
Light aromas of dark chocolate, plum, herbs, flowers and tropical fruit provide intrigue. The dark fruit flavors are full in feel, showing depth and concentration along with a grip of tannins.
Definitely on the young and lush side, this Morellino is redolent of fresh raspberry, blueberry with a dab of toasted nut thanks to a brief two-month passage in oak. It proves an easy drink with more berry flavors and a fresh, firm mouthfeel.
Full-bodied, lush and showing just a bit of alcoholic warmth, The Wild Ride features high-toned boysenberry fruit on the nose, a touch of herbal nuance and the slightest hint of raisined fruit on the palate. Drink this creamy-textured, superripe Shiraz over the next few years.
Fresh, concentrated and with a fine Chenin Blanc structure and firm style, this shows plenty of almonds, pears and red apples. The aftertaste has a great lift of acidity.
Earthy and simple-fruity, with way too much toasted oak.  Will have its fans.
This simple offering opens with aromas of stone fruit and toasted almond. The palate offers yellow peach, apricot and citrus, with a hint of flint on the close.
Norm Yost is considered the sparkling pioneer of Santa Barbara County, and his bubblies continue to excel. This exhibits fresh lemon and lime zest notes, with wet cement, peach blossom and sourdough yeast on the nose. There is a grippy tension to the palate, where lemon, green apple and biscuity flavors intermingle.
Almost black in color, this densely ripe wine is powered by wood aging and dark tannins. The blend of Syrah, Alicante Bouschet, Aragonez and Cabernet Sauvignon is tough, firm and tannic while also having big, bold juicy black plum flavors. Drink from 2017.
Here's a Vermentino from southern Puglia with thick, saturated tones of sun-ripened fruit, dried apricot and honey. The wine has a fun, generous personality and thick density in the mouth.
Cherry-scented, clean and fruity. Good concentration mid-palate, with no discernable new oak, just a balanced, firm attack and a strong, chewy finish. Only 123 cases made.
This soft spicy wine comes from the heart of the Entre-deux-Mers region. It has blackberry fruits and balanced acidity, typical of the vintage. The wine is fruity, just backed up by tannins and is ready to drink.
On the tannic side of Gamay, this could be young Pinot Noir in its mineral structure and solid texture. It is a wine for aging with its black plum and spice flavors, with the acidity lighting up the aftertaste.
This opens with bright aromas of raspberry and toasted almond. There's a nicely etched quality that gives it a firm, solid mouthfeel.
Lots of ripe Zinny character in this wine, which is a blend of vineyards from throughout the valley. It's enormously rich in raspberry and cherry jam fruit, spiced with cinnamon, cloves and anise, and finished with sweet, smoky sandalwood.
A distinctive expression from Valpolicella, this shows pretty herb notes of oregano and dried mint, with licorice and spice accents. There are also softer tones of coffee, leather and juicy black cherry. Overall, this is elegant, nuanced and powerful.
Mostly Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, with a bit of Cabernet Franc and Malbec, this is a juicy, tart effort. Sappy berries, a bit of pineapple and a finishing hint of caramel all come together in this lively, fresh blend.
This is a better wine than Maclean's '01, riper and richer. It shows blackberry, cassis and oak flavors, and a good structure. Still, it could use greater concentration.
Forceful and rustic, with aromas of barnyard, tree bark and black plum. Raspberry and sour cherry flavors create a sharp-edged palate, while the finish is peppery and a touch bitter. Leaves you wanting more.
This new vintage is head and shoulders better than the previous effort. Light and pretty, with a delicate mix of citrus, melon, tangerine, lemon and lime, it's showing good length and impressive detail.
This wine has an elegant, refreshing character that offers complexity as well as approachability. The nose is a combination of red berry, spice and pepper, and on the palate, spicy, savory flavors give the wine a meaty complexity. Overall though, it offers good balance and minerality and a long, appealing finish.
A beautiful Pinot Gris that defines the drier, more elegant style in California. This 2009 is entirely consistent with past vintages from Etude, which have been superior. Shows Meyer lemon, lime, vanilla and peppery spice flavors, with a long, distinguished finish. Etude hasn't raised the price in many years. Production was 3,319 cases.
Irresistible from the get-go, this fragrant wine offers up inviting aromas of citrus, stone and exotic tropical fruits. Flavors of ripe peaches, brightened with vivid acidity, keep it in perfect balance. The 1.4% residual sugar is barely noticeable; the finish lingers gracefully and refreshes the palate, inviting the next sip.
Was it the chilly vintage that made this wine so elusive? Tasted in the spring, it was oaky and jammy with raspberries and cherries, with the astringent tannins of green herb tea. Hard to tell where it's going, if anywhere, but it does have dryness and vital acidity in its favor.
This medium-dry Champagne is attractively structured and really fruity. It does have something of the mineral texture of a drier Champagne that is contrasted with apricot and honey highlights. It is ready to drink.
In the new wave of light, fresh Grüner Veltliner, this charming, friendly wine is all lifted green fruits, crisply fresh, just touched by a structure of fresh apple skins. Screwcap.
Tasting very ripe and a touch sweet, this deep pink wine smells like melons, tastes like cherry jam and feels smooth and soft on the palate.
A light, crisp blend of Merlot and Syrah, this is soft and gently fruity. Raspberry and red-currant flavors shine easily through this simple wine.
Abbazia di Novacella presents a focused and bright expression of Gewürztraminer that delivers fresh fruit and honeysuckle followed by zesty lime and wild sage. The wine shows soft thickness and creaminess on the close. Very nice.
A fruity wine with soft tannins that is ready to drink. It has banana, red cherry and light spice flavors, finished off with attractive acidity.
This very fresh and lively wine shows tart black currant, black plum and candied black cherry aromas, as well as elegant hints of lilac and potpourri. That purple flower note fuels the palate, with more lilac and lavender, and the structure is quite firm for its relatively light weight.
There are some fine, dry tannins in this wine along the dark cherry fruit and acidity. It comes from a single vineyard part of the 61-acre estate of Jean-Paul Dubost. There is a ripe feeling here; drink this balanced wine now.
Pascal and Laure Doquet produce Chardonnay-dominated wines. This 1997 premier cru has 25% Pinot Noir in the blend, giving a rich, cookie-and-toast character just beginning to show through the fresh, green fruits. It is finely balanced, very pure.
Foxy red-berry aromas suggest animal hide and wet fur. This feels raw, wiry and scratchy due to sharp acidity and rough tannins. Foxy herbal plum and currant flavors finish with an abrasive scour, mild heat and salty notes.
Ripe blueberry, black-cherry syrup, cola and clove cream combine for a complex nose on this bottling by winemaker Carl Bowker. The palate is vibrant with acidity, yet rich with baked blueberries. Waves of wild California herbs add further nuance, making for a wine that finds a nice balance between disparate elements.
Opens with apple and buttercup aromas that are encouraging, but the palate falls off. It's wet but shows no definition or fruit. Creamy and generic in the mouth, and ultimately it doesn't go anywhere besides being plump and loaded with vanilla.
From a three-acre block of a fantastic vineyard known for powerful finesse, this offers characteristic intensity, a fleshy, tropical pineapple and guava sensibility that makes the wine rich and thick.

Great color but a bit green on the nose. Amid the timid bell pepper and green bean accents—and they're just that, accents—there's dark fruit and espresso.

This may be atypically dark and powerful, but this wine provides a rich, satisfying drink that hopefully presages more good things to come from the 2005 vintage Pinots.

This AVA is a hotbed for this grape, as this ripe, robust effort demonstrates. Concentrated plum and cherry fruit has a whiff of leather, along with pretty baking spices.

This is a big Pinot Noir, dark and full bodied and juicy in pomegranates, cherries, red plums and sautéed wild mushrooms, and the interplay of oak with fruit even yields richer notes of milk chocolate.

A full bodied, rich Pinot Noir, from a small 4-acre parcel, packed with solid tannins, bright, bitter cherry flavors and a definite high toast wood element. This is Vacheron's top red cuvée, and it does need several years to soften, open out and lose its raw wood edge.

Dark in color, with aromas of raisin, cassis, cough medicine and baked plum. More of a sweet, stocky style of Cab than your average linear, textbook version; but the blackberry and plum flavors, while chunky, are warm and well assembled. Richer than your average value-priced Cab, so drink now.
Simple but fresh, with mild lemon and melon aromas propped up by a kiss of oak. The palate is plump, fruity and melony, with toasted corn and baked apple nuances. Comes together well.

A touch neutral on the nose, but overall this is a nice, minerally, grassy SB with lots of green apple and freshness. The palate offers depth and clarity, and the flavors of green fruits are good. Falls off on the finish, which seems flat compared to the rest of the wine.
Light and fresh, this is an apple-crisp wine with delicious acidity and a refreshing lemon tang. A finely textured character gives shape to the wine and supports the crunchy fruit. Drink this wine now.
Almost entirely Cabernet Sauvignon, with 9% Petit Verdot, this wine spent two years in barrel.

Made in an immediately appealing style, this dry Pinot has a silky elegance that makes it easy to savor the cherry, currant, cola, pomegranate and pepper flavors. Best now and for a few years.
This winery gives its wines extra years in bottle prior to release, and it pays off with powerful, muscular, densely structured that have been polished to a fine luster. This Syrah emphasizes fruit, not funk, with opulent flavors of black fruit, dried cherry, fig and plum. The 30 months it spent in two-thirds new French oak adds dark streaks of coffee and cocoa. It shows tremendous depth, and it could be cellared for another few years—but why wait?

A medium-bodied blend that contains 8% Viognier, the 2007 Y Series S-V features slightly lifted aromas of sour plum and tea leaves, while the flavors include an herbal, drying component and a crisp finish. Not the soft, lush fruit bomb typical for the price point, and notable for that, which will serve it well alongside grilled burgers or lamb chops.
Beautifully aromatic, this purple-hued wine offers generous plum and black cherry flavors that are cloaked in mocha, with muscular, earthy tannins. It spent over two years in barrel (half new oak), and will benefit from a bit more bottle age for all of its rich flavors to fully integrate.
Prickly acidity marks the entry of this wine, blowing off over time to reveal cucumber, dill and a layering of black cherry, clove and tobacco. The thicket of tannins softens in the glass.
Pleasing aromas of marionberry, cocoa and spice are followed by lightly styled but still palate-coating fruit flavors. A velvety texture heightens the appeal, with fruit and barrel flavors lingering on the finish.
Made from old vines, this ripe and firm wine is young and still developing. It has black fruits that are lifted by the juicy, concentrated acidity. Structure, spice, pepper and a generous, full palate all point to some aging. Drink from 2017.
The rarest of the Spring Valley wines, this pure Cabernet Sauvignon offers ripe plum fruit flavors, wrapped in baking chocolate and licorice. It finishes with accents of sandalwood and citrus.
Rustic and somewhat sharp, this Zin has a green, spearmint streak, with some harsh tannins, which suggests unevenly ripened berries, despite very high alcohol. It's like a combination of cherry Lifesavers, blackberries and Altoids breath mints. Drink now.
Not considered a noble varietal, Carignane can offer pleasure, and this one does. ItÕs quite rich and smells and tastes Porty, with dark chocolate and raisin notes, although the official alcohol is a moderate 13.6%. The plummy flavors are powerful, the tannins and acids soft.
Full-bodied and youthfully tannic, but quite promising, this wine features a big core of cassis fruit and plenty of oak-derived embellishment. It's not herbal, but not pruny either, hitting the sweet spot between under- and overripe. Good now, but should hold through at least 2013.

Light aromas of plum and spice are followed by cherry flavors that show pleasing purity. This is a delightful example of the variety.

Mature plum, ripe berry, baking spice, underbrush and a balsamic note are some of the aromas you'll find on this full-bodied wine. On the chewy palate, notes of cinnamon, clove and licorice add depth to dried cherry and raspberry. Velvety tannins give it just enough tension and texture. Drink 2018–2024.
Though it seems quite light on first impression, that is a bit deceptive. The biodynamic grapes show a muted earthiness, while over time the cranberry and raspberry flavors gain focus and concentration in the mouth. A graceful, nicely proportioned wine, with some stem and grip to the tannins.
This is an elegant, subtle and spicy varietal wine that reflects its origins, impacted by coastal coolness and ferocity. Dried thyme, stemmy earth, black tea and a viscous grip of oak show its youth and quiet, brooding power.
Made using organically farmed fruit, this blend of rare indigenous grapes from Puglia opens with a dusty mineral shading, plus notes of ripe blackberry, prune and cigar box. It is sweet and chewy on the finish.
If you're sensitive to high alcohol, this wine isn't for you. If you're not, it has plenty to offer in the way of flavor, including raspberries, chocolate and pepper. Turns a bit overripe in the finish, but not too much.
Made with 100% Sangiovese, this conveys aromas of violet, vanilla, pressed powder and perfumed berry. The vibrant, structured palate delivers juicy wild cherry, licorice, black pepper and toast alongside firm tannins and fresh acidity. It finishes on a mocha note. Drink 2015–2022.
Earthy aromas lead to a wine that is at a stage of development that suppresses fruit. The wood aging and the extracted structure are still strong. Hints of juicy black fruits emerge, promising a good, if tannic future. Wait until 2017.
On first take, the bouquet is hampered by reduced aromas of iodine and the palate feels hard, tight and racy. With airing, this shows better. Flavors of blackberry and plum come to life and finish well, and as a whole, this is good in a pedestrian, regular way.
Light and luminous in appearance, this bright Rosso di Montalcino delivers subdued aromas of raspberry, cherry, cola and wet earth. None of these aromas are particularly intense, but they are balanced.

The flabby citrus aroma is dusty and shows a tinge of vanilla, which is an aroma that isn't normally associated with Sauvignon Blanc. The palate is big and globby, with an oily note and flavors of citrus, green herb and nettle.
This basic wine opens with earthy red-berry aromas. The palate offers choppiness and green-leaning flavors of berry and tea. The finish is scratchy and hollow. An OK Garnacha on its best day.
A little smokier in flavor and a little firmer in mouthfeel than other comparable wines, this has an intriguing angular personality that's intended not for cocktail hour but for pairing with, say, a roast pheasant. It has tart-cherry and berry flavors, some light peppery, woodsy accents and lusty, gripping tannins. Best after 2019.
For a Ribera rosé, this gets it mostly right. The nose is neutral and standard, while the spunky palate sports good acidity and flavors of strawberry and raspberry. Wet and refreshing on the finish, and good overall.
This longtime favorite seems to have gotten sweeter over the years, and I think it's about reached its limit, as there's just enough acidity for a semblance of balance. Floral notes of roses and berries burst from the glass, while the flavors feature juicy summer berries and a hint of chocolate.
This bears blackberry, black currant and cherry liqueur flavors, and the 12% Syrah component seems to bring a peppery roasted-meat note. Although the wine is technically dry, it's a little warm and sweet in glycerine—the result of high alcohol. Drink now.

Barrel toast is front and center on the creamy, vanilla-laden bouquet. This white Garnacha features good body and balance, but the barrel influence is unavoidable and dominant. Resiny, toasty and showing some apple along the way.

This simple, fruity wine has both crisp, citrusy acidity and riper apricot and pear flavors. It's soft and finishes with attractive tangy acidity. Drink now.
This is pure Chenin Blanc from Kiona's 1976 planting, fermented in concrete eggs and left on the lees for five months. A pretty golden hue, this bone dry wine did not undergo malolactic and has retained its sturdy acid base. Rich with glycerine, it's scented with and has flavors of lemon oil, orange peel and candied pineapple.
Grenache, Mourvèdre and Syrah combine for a tasty package that's budget-minded to boot. Opening with an intense earthiness and layers of tart cherry, it also offers brambly, gamy meatiness and a finish of black pepper. The majority of the grapes are Grenache, but the wine is as marked by the anise and earthiness of the Mourvèdre as anything else.
Here's a wine that just cannot overcome the limitations of the vintage. They tried for extract and gave it some pretty oak but nonetheless herbal, bell pepper characteristics overshadow its modest berry fruit.
Six months of barrel aging have given this wine an extra richness and spice. Under the tannins and wood, the ripe red fruits are developing well to eventually give a structured while fruity wine. Drink from 2019.

A mix of herbal berry, foresty notes and leather comprise the flavor profile, while the finish is gritty, tannic, salty and hard. Give this muscular Malbec plenty of air before drinking.
The bouquet offers a wide array of aromatic details that still need time to integrate. Notes of spice, black fruit, cola, ginger, licorice and sweet chewing tobacco are all recognizable. A pungent note of dried apple skin makes for a lively finish.
From one of the most familiar of the Meursault Premier Crus, this wine is crisp and mineral in character. It has tight acidity with apple and green-plum fruit that is laced by a light amount of wood aging. The wine is still young and will be better from 2018.
This is an ebullient wine, full of herb, grapefruit and wet-earth aromas as well as very tangy yet sweet-seeming citrus flavors. It has good concentration and stays fresh through the finish.
Stewy, savory aromas of prune, coffee grinds and turned earth lack freshness and liveliness. A full, dense, rubbery palate deals earthy, roasted berry, plum and currant flavors. This is big and grabby on a savory tasting finish.
Easy yet complex, this ripasso-method red is ultrasmooth, with rich, dark cherry and plum fruit riding the velvety palate. This supple, full-flavored red delivers plenty of pleasure. Will pair well with dinner, yet is round enough to sip.
So ripe, it's like drinking the Platonic essence of cherries and blackberries, sweet and satisfying in fruity richness. Oak adds the usual level of flashy toast. It's a little on the soft side, but dramatically layered. Hard to tell where it's going down the road, so drink over the next six years.
Quite foamy and shaded toward very pale salmon/copper, this young wine tastes of green apples, spice, wild strawberry and cherry candy. It's pretty, clean and light, but thins out a bit quickly.
This is mostly Syrah, with 10% each Grenache and Mourvèdre. Fat and beefy, it starts with a scent of fresh carpaccio around dense black cherry fruit. Lush and generous, with notes of both fruit and barrel, it adds streaks of coffee and cacao that wind through a long and beautifully defined finish.
Like the 2006 bottling, the winery's '07 is enormously rich and extracted, with concentrated flavors of blackberry, prune, cassis, cocoa and cedar. The alcohol high, and it shows up in the form of heat and a glycerine-driven sweetness—although the wine itself is dry.
This faint, elusive wine takes lightness and low alcohol to pronounced levels, offering intense lemon and Asian pear around a tight core of acidity. From the Pratt Vineyard, it spent time aging in both new air-dried Vosges oak barrels and small stainless steel.
The wine is finely integrated, bringing together ripe pear and apricot fruit flavors with fresh acidity. It is really only off dry, a wine for fish dishes rather than for desserts. The acidity at the end is refreshing and crisp.
Full, almost jammy flavors of strawberry preserves and sweet cherries jump out, with light milk chocolate highlights. Though I don't find it to be particularly varietal (in terms of Tuscan sangio), it is still a very tasty wine with plenty of plump, sweet fruit appeal.
Not unkind aromas of bath oil and flowers set the stage for slightly pithy citrus and melon flavors. Registers as chunky in the mouth, with additional pith and a slight bitterness to the finish. Pretty good overall.
From a small appellation north of the Pouilly-Fumé region, this wine is lightly fruity. It has creamy acidity and a perfumed character that comes from the lemon and honey fruitiness. Drink now.

The oak is accented in pretty ways by clove, sage and cardamom spice. Structured and soft, the finish is lengthy and the wine perfectly capable of waiting until 2019–2021 in a cellar.
Few wineries in Central Otago devote much time or energy to Sauvignon Blanc, so it's nice to try one on occasion. This is pungent and boxwood-like on the nose, but the flavors are less aggressive, more white grapefruit and celery stalk. There's ample weight and a crisp, refreshing finish.
Oveja Negra consistently produces a very good Cabernet with inky darkness and concentrated aromas of black fruits and toast. This vintage is saturated on the tongue, with lactic notes as well as acidic cut. Blackberry flavors mix with creamy oak and tangy acidity to create a fresh, honest impression.
The texture on this Pinot lacks silky sumptuousness. It's a bit brawny, but it's bone dry, with good acidity. The flavors are interesting, veering between raspberries to tarter cranberries, with earthiness. Try aging it until 2019 to see if it comes around.
This is mild on the nose, with a lemon-lime aroma. The palate is soft, but it has a pulse. The wine's citrus, melon and tropical flavors finish flat. For the most part, it's clean and quaffable.

Details of iron and baking spice emerge also, and the silky tannins glide through a lengthy and delightful finish. A blend of 87% Cabernet Sauvignon, 8% Cabernet Franc and 5% Merlot.
On the one hand, this wine seems almost honeyed, broad and rather lush. On the other, it shows hints of green vegetables reminiscent of tinned peas. Together, the blend of 70% Sauvignon and 30% Sémillon works reasonably well, ending with the sensation of sun-warmed ripe stone fruit.
Charred aromas top this dark-fruited, high-quality Bobal from central Spain. While not very complex, this wine is exceedingly friendly and easy to like; it feels smooth and deep, with oaky goodness supporting black-fruit, carob and herbal flavors. Toast, blackberry, licorice and clove flavors all rise up on a clean, medium-length finish.

So deliciously forward in raspberries and cherries, you're tempted to drink it now, and that's fine. You can.

The vineyard is a great one, source over the years to high-scoring Pinots from MacPhail, Fulcrum, Expression 38 and others.
Initial molasses, raisin and maple aromas indicate heavy ripeness, but in the mouth this is refined and lifted, with fine acidity that pumps everything up a notch. Flavors of plum, herbs, spice and vanilla end with tobacco, lasting acidity and complexity. Drink this classic Rioja now through 2018.
Soft and simple, with sweetened cherry candy flavors. The finish is hot in alcohol.
Ambitious and concentrated, with an inky color and a juicy, mouthwatering palate framed by mature blackberry and raspberry fruit.

Already showing signs of earthy maturity, this wine is unlikely to benefit from further aging though the firm acid will allow it to keep another year or two.

From the very fine 2007 vintage comes this surprisingly tannic Cabernet. Even at the age of more than four years, it's still tough and astringent. It has a sweet core of blackberries, and it's tempting to recommend aging. But there's a troubling touch of raisins, so drink up.
Sweet and lightweight, with typical floral, green apple and peach aromas and flavors. Lime flavors kick in on the finish, which seem a bit insubstantial and lacking depth. A superficial charmer that's easy to drink over the next few years—just don't expect a long-term relationship. Imported by Valckenberg International, Inc.
A barrel buster, with huge barrique qualities including char, chocolate and vanilla along with ripe black-fruit aromas. Spirited is the best way to describe this masculine, tannic bruiser, which is a blend of old-vines Garnacha and Carignan. Hold a couple of years to let it settle, then enjoy.
Lots of delicious orange flavor in this pretty wine. It's overtly sweet, but a too soft for comfort.

A sharp note of crushed white pepper gives this a bright, pungent bouquet. The aromas are softened by pretty notes of peach, dried herb and clove. This has loads of personality and depth.
92-94 Barrel sample. A big, generous, rounded wine that has great, ripe fruits, balanced with acidity. This is full, open, and will be delicious.
It will be fascinating to taste this wine in six, eight, ten years. Right now, it's big, thick, dry and powerful. So sweet is the cherry fruit and so silky is the texture that the wine could almost be a young Grenache. Seems to have what it takes to age, so try after 2015.
The nose shows irresistable youthful notes of pear and apple while the palate is a bit simpler and fairly soft. Short, cherry-infused finish. Drink by the pool.
Lovely and pure notes of Conference pear hover above a concentrated taut body. This is dry and has a pleasantly bitter pithy edge that seems to draw out the precision of the fruit even more. The palate is streamlined, taut and energetic and the finish is long and impressive with a final flourish of pear and citrus.

The angular frame of this light red sports dry cherry aromas and flavors with leather accents. The palate shows some tobacco notes and it closes dry, with slightly prickly tannins.
The producer's high mark for excellence, this opaque, thickly tannic wine begs for more time in the bottle.

This rich, spicy Zinfandel defines the Dry Creek style. It's fruit-forward in briary, brambly berry and currant flavors that have hints of anise and chocolate, and is dry, with sturdy tannins and a balancing cut of acidity. Very enticing. Only 150 cases were produced, but it's worth a search.
This estate has been producing wine in Morgon since the 11th century. The wine comes from structured granite soil in a blend of different parcels.

This Syrah offers plush cherry and blackberry notes, with cured meat, tobacco and black pepper touches. It feels smooth, rich and soft.

Made from selected lots of Testarossa's various vineyards up and down the state, hence the California appellation, this is also the winery's most expensive Pinot Noir. Right now, it's not showing terribly well. There's something closed and stubborn about it. Partly that's the tannins and acidity, but mostly it may be because these scattered lots simply haven't come together yet to make nice. Give it 3–4 years.
This is a crisp, intensely fruity wine. Full of red berries and fresh acidity, it is dry with a tangy orange-peel character, light minerality and a touch of caramel. It is ready to drink.

Expertly integrated aromas of black plum, vanilla cola, light clove, pralines and a touch of caramel cream show on the nose of this bottling by a Sta. Rita Hills producer that sourced from up north.

Just about half and half Cab Sauvignon and Petite Sirah, this red smells Porty, with caramelized, brown sugar aromas. Tastes semi-sweet, too, with chocolate fudge, cherry jam and cassis flavors. What are we to make of it? It's all wrong for a table wine, but it's so yummy.
Beautiful PG, one of the better ones out there, and the kind of wine that's driving the category through the roof. Absolutely dry, elegantly crisp and minerally-fruity, it defines elegance. The flavors veer toward limes and grapefruits and riper, lusher tropical fruits and white flowers.
From Miguel Angel de Gregorio of Finca Allende, this is a nice, thorough, creamy white with aromas of white fruits, vanilla and straw. The palate has spiced peach, apple and pear flavors, and the finish is exceedingly creamy and deep. Shows elegance and adequate power, but needs to be drunk soon.
From one of the Riboli family's new estate vineyards, this bottling is a clean but quite ripe style of Viognier, with blousy aromas of tuberose, coconut and guava. It's tighter on the palate, with honeydew, key lime and guava sorbet flavors.

Production size of this pure, estate-grown, Red Mountain Malbec is much lower in 2011. Earthy and showing a whiff of leather, it brings dried cherry fruit, a streak of dark chocolate and smooth tannins in a juicy wine with a lively finish. Hints of orange peel linger long after the last swallow.

Cherry and plum aromas lack purity and turn more earthy, horsey and unclean upon airing. Sharp, cutting acidity creates and jagged palate, while flavors of sour black plum and cherry finish with saucy notes on a choppy, short finish.
A well-oaked wine with some modern touches. It's ripe and ready but not overdone; the flavors are of raspberry and light resin, but not much else. Like many 2005s, this Cab shows a subdued personality and less-than-expressive fruit. It's good and inoffensive, but it doesn't make you take notice.
Deep golden-yellow in the glass, this wine offers honeyed, candied aromas of mango, crystallized vanilla and golden raisin. It's thick and unctuous on the palate, with more honey, spun sugar, honeysuckle and fruit-nectar flavors that are delicious, but would be aided by a boost of acidity.

There's a slightly smoky, fume character to this wine's otherwise ripe aromas of stone fruit, melon and fig, giving an extra layer of complexity. And despite the ripe aromas, this wine is crisp and grassy on the palate, delivering a long finish with finely delineated flavors.
Aromatically expressive, this conveys cranberry and milk chocolate. It's full of fruit and barrel flavors with a lightly creamy feel.
The famous E&E; Shiraz also comes in a sparkling version. There's no denying the quality of the 2001, which boasts bold aromas of toast, cedar, vanilla and blackberries. The mouthfeel is full, creamy and lush, and while it finishes a touch sweet, there's just enough tannin and acid to keep it balanced. Delicious now, but these wines can age 10 or more years from the vintage.
Concentrated and rich in flavor and creamy in texture, this wine has a big profile without seeming overtly fruity or oaky. The mouthfeel is lush, broad and quietly powerful, while subtle pear and marzipan flavors coat the palate and linger on the finish. It makes a grand impression and is “meaty” enough to serve with poultry or even beef. Winemaker Tracy Hart used no oak or stainless steel, fermenting and aging the wine in food-grade polyethylene FlexTanks.
Dry, schisty aromas of cherry and spice are reserved and elevated. This is a bright wine with juicy acidity and complexity. Flavors of baked berry fruits are minerally at the core, while the finish is smooth, mature and steady, with lasting purity. Drink through 2019.
Aromas of ripe dark-skinned fruit and a whiff of exotic spice lead the nose on this ­straightforward red. The medium-bodied palate offers prune, mature black cherry and a hint of star anise alongside dusty, but rather fleeting tannins that leave a tongue-drying finish.
Normally we don't remark on a wine's color or clarity, but this one is a throwback: rich golden-yellow and cloudy. Heavily toasted whole-wheat bread couples with earth and custard aromas, and then the lemon and tangerine flavors hit you on the palate. Finishes with some elegant lemon and clove notes.
New Dry Creek Vineyard Winemaker Tim Bell is showing finesse with this signature white for the winery. All stainless-steel fermented, it's racy in acidity and offers juicy fruit flavors of apricot, lemon and lime, plus fresh-cut grass and an herbal streak on top of stony minerality. It finishes long. Pair it with oysters and a day on the bay.
This falls right in the middle of the winery's dry and sweet Rieslings, with a suggestion of honey to the apricot, tangerine and vanilla flavors. It would be a wonderful companion to modern Asian fare.
Chewy, earthy and tannic, this rather awkward wine matches cranberry and black cherry hard candy fruit to a rough, stemmy underbelly. There is some leather and barnyard in the middle; all in all it's a bit of a rough ride.
Dense, rich red fruit belies an elegant wine that finds balance despite the concentration of vanilla and berry. Soft, approachable and integrated tannin and oak let the whole exist as one, instead of separate parts. This shows off the appellation's mountain fruit and rocky minerality.
Soft, tangy and fruity, this is a ripe wine that shows both freshness and richness. It's approachable now, and full of creamed apple flavor. Delicious to drink as an apéritif. Screwcap.
Very dry and tannic, showing the freshly-crushed Asian spices of the Santa Maria Valley. Full-bodied and a little heavy at this point, offering ripe raspberry, cherry, currant and anise flavors. Give it a few years to mellow.
Pungent and leafy at first, this also boasts honey and passion fruit aromas. It's medium in body, with tropical, pineapple flavors and a clean, refreshing finish. Drink up.
This is 100% Pommard clone, bright and spicy in the nose. The fruit flavors are sharp and penetrating, with brambly berries and a touch of pine sap.
Sourced from three great Chardonnay vineyards (Stanly Ranch, Hyde and Silverado-Suscol), this Chard is enormously flavorful in fruit custard flavors and new oak. It's delicious, but a little obvious, especially on the oak side, and could have more complex nuances and angles. Drink now.
This orange-style wine is dark straw in color and has jasmine and vanilla tones on the nose, while flavors of canned apricots and fresh peaches drive the palate. There's a soft and sensuous finish, due to the 18 month barrels aging.
Very dry, as Clare Rieslings should be, this is an ideal pre-dinner sip. Its flavors are palate cleansing and subtle—think citrus peel and mineral/stone, and its acidity is just tangy enough. Olive oil, cracker and citrus aromas start it all off. Imported by Foster's Wine Estates Americas.
Another late-arriving 1999 Barolo, Dardano's boasts a rich, expansive mouthfeel allied to flavors of prune, dried cherry, leather and earth. It's a sturdy, chewy wine, one that could use a few years in the cellar to round into shape. Try after 2010.
This fruitless Garnacha Blanca smells a bit too much like rotting compost. A plump palate holds bitter flavors in front of a pithy finish. Overall, there's very little that's good about this.
With a rich, caramel-teased nose, this is a full-bodied and voluptuous Chardonnay that evolves in the glass to display much greater sophistication and concentration. It finishes light and lemony, rounded out by juicy stone fruit.
Spicy orange rind and sunny tangerine notes offset steely shards of lime and mineral in this bracing, deeply concentrated Riesling. The midpalate smooths out richly, glazed by a sheen of lanolin that stretches out the finish. Drinks beautifully already, but should improve through 2020.
An appealing fragrance of red rose and violet mingled with a whiff of baking spices drifts out of the glass. The juicy palate offers crushed Morello cherry, vanilla, licorice and cinnamon alongside firm but fine tannins. It's a balanced, classic Barbaresco.
High in acidity, restrained and focused on freshness above all else, this wine shines with wet stone, Meyer lemon and grapefruit peel flavors.
This is the winery's best Nebula in years. While it's still a little on the soft, sweet side, the cool vintage has resonated in the wine's flavor, giving it a good structure housing cherry, currant and sandalwood flavors. Drink now.
Roundness and spice feature strongly here. A phenolic midpalate gives backbone and suggests that this is best had with food where its structure will come into play.
Leesy, cheesy aromas fall apart as this struggles a bit to present a clean front side. Almost dilute in feel, this tastes of cidery apple, nectarine and lees. On the finish, a hint of popcorn rises up.
Dating to 1740, this classed-growth estate has vines in the heartland of Côtes de Provence. This wine is lightly herbal, with crisp acidity. Apricot and green herb flavors give a lively character and bring out the crisp, tight texture at the end.
Soft and perfumed, the flavors are elegant but intense at the same time. The acidity gives a great freshness to what is in fact a rich wine, the apple and pear flavors going deep down to the steely core. It would be worth aging this wine—maybe 3–5 years.
Delicate aromas of honeysuckle, white stone fruit and citrus present themselves to the nose while the fun, simple palate shows green pear and a hint of lime. Zesty acidity gives it a tangy close.
Year after year, Fuligni delivers some of the most attractive and richly complex wines from Montalcino. This year's interpretation, however, seems to put more emphasis on territory-driven notes of mineral and earth. You'll also recognize bright blueberry and pristine cherry notes that promise a long aging future. Drink now through 2015.
Ripe malty berry aromas blend seamlessly with darker notes of toasty oak and asphalt. This Cab Franc (with 15% Malbec) feels big and pulpy, but also healthy and juicy. Flavors of blackberry, cassis and mixed herbs finish with oaky notes of mocha, coffee and toasty berry. Drink through 2024.
This exuberant wine has aromas of raspberry jam, thyme, orange peel, earth, iron and olive. It's rich and intensely flavorful, with waves of mouthwatering fruit and savory notes that lead to an extended finish.
The Olazabal/Ferreira family owns two Douro quintas, this and Vale Meão, high up-river. Vallado is in a cooler, wetter climate, and produces elegant wines, in a modern, smooth style. Based on one of the lesser Port grapes, the Sousão, this is full of black currant fruits and new wood flavors.
This is a firm wine although with superb fruit. It is structured and dense, dark with tarry tannins as well as juicy fruitiness. It is a powerful wine that certainly has the freshness of the year while also having dark, dense tannins. Drink from 2025.
Finding ripe Petit Verdot outside the Médoc in Bordeaux is unusual. And then to make an 100% varietal wine is very rare. It is a rich wine without being excessive. Its tannins and structure are firm, backed up by black fruits that will surely develop as the wine matures. Drink this success story from 2020.
Refreshingly marked by a tangy acidity, this white is made to please, fermented entirely in stainless steel. It sings in zesty, medium-bodied layers of peach and lime that are fresh and juicy on the palate, yet it somehow maintains some unexpected complexity.
Light in color and weight, this is a nicely composed Pinot Meunier. Old world in style, it's integrated in raspberry fruit and a hint of mint, making it soft and easy to drink.
Ausstich means a personal selection, and this is Hans Setzer's favorite. It is crisp to the core, with concentration surrounding this steely interior. The texture is taut, leavened by pepper, giving a wine that bursts with freshness but is also well-rounded. Screwcap. Imported by Michael Skurnik Wines.
A little on the thin side, this wine has modest green apple, pink grapefruit and vanilla char flavors. It's bone dry and crisp, with a fast finish.
A malty earthy woody nose with berry, vanilla and tobacco aromas is complete and generous. This is a bit tough and acidic, but that bodes well for the future. Flavors of marzipan, vanilla, coconut, mocha, black plum and raisin finish with depth and length. Drink through 2023.
Crisp with herbal acidity as well a white stone fruits, this is a fresh wine vinified in 500-liter oak barrels. It has a tight texture and tangy aftertaste. This attractive wine from Nicolas Thienpont and his son Cyrille is ready now.
Meager and slightly thin, this offers red fruit, herbal cedar and tobacco, though the flavors are subtle and hard to make out.
Cheesy oak aromas and murky fruit scents are less than what Atauta usually offers. Chalk it up to the rough conditions of chilly 2013. In the mouth, this is choppy. Roasted berry and earthy notes precede a tannic, rubbery finish.
White-fruit flavors are minerally and crisp, leading to a bone-dry palate that is lean and zesty. Flavors of lime-infused seltzer and green apple finish tangy and direct, with an echo of green herbs.
Tobacco and pepper combine to create slight stable aromas. Black- and red-berry fruit is chunky, with a mild burn. More rustic than refined, with a dry, clipped finish. If you like your Cabs big and viscous, try this one.
Funky on the nose in a good way, this wine is aided by 6% Viognier and 1% Roussanne. It shows roasted fennel, elderberry, grilled lamb, pencil lead and savory black pepper on the nose. The palate starts ripe with blackberries and blueberries, then evolves into thyme, oregano and marjoram, with roasted beef on the edges.
This is quite flavorful, with apples, pears and peaches equally in the mix. The fruit is front and center, and the wine has unusual polish for its price. It keeps coming on through a surprisingly long finish, with nicely structured skin and rind flavors wrapping up the finish.
Pure Roussanne; plump and spicy, with beguiling accents of cinnamon around rich fruit. Orange, tangerine and apricot fruits are in full display, the wine is round and luscious and the finish quite full and satisfying.
This wine surprises and delights in its heady perfume and depth of cherry, cinnamon and brown sugar. Undoubtedly ripe, it holds its boldness well, allowing for glimpses of elegance amid the velvety layers of serious flavor.
Richly oaked aromas of burnt wood, caramel and sawmill compete with jammy blackberry and cassis notes. A rugged, drawing palate is fiercely tannic and dry. Blackberry, burnt oak and coffee flavors dry out quickly on the finish, leaving simmering toasty mint. Drink through 2025.
Fragrant notes of spiced plum, cherry and milk chocolate are met with toast and herbs on the palate. The acidity is a façade to smooth, sheer tannins and the finish is layered in oak and cocoa.
Fresh-cut flowers and gooseberries lend characteristically green, grassy notes to this light-bodied, refreshing Sauvignon Blanc. It's delicate in concentration but finishes elegantly on a chalky, mineral note.
Strongly flavored by the barrel fermentation and extended lees contact, this rich and textural Chardonnay opens with toasted coconut, banana cream pie, pear tart and other pastry-like delights. It is not fruit-deficient, however, and there is plenty of snappy acidity under all the goodies.
Gaudium has character and persistency and offers a very dry and mineral-driven interpretation of the southern Italian Fiano grape. The variety has good structure naturally and in this case it helps move the wine across the palate in a smooth and direct manner.
Nice and dark, with a generous set of raisin, earth and mineral aromas to go with more standard blackberry scents. Saturated and balanced across the palate, with acidity and a good set of moderate tannins supporting flavors of baked plum, soy sauce and other savory, slightly herbal flavors. Very good for everyday Carmenère.
Very Maipo-like in aromatics, with olive, leather, desert shrubs and basil, while the palate is tight, driven, acidic and tough. Dense and herbal in terms of flavors, with black fruit and oregano notes that fade on the finish. Extremely potent and muscular, but as the name suggests, it has character.
Loire Cabernet Franc like this has great spicy flavors, rich red berry fruits and some stalkiness. The structure comes from firm, dry tannins that appear on the finish.
Wonderfully smooth and layered, this medium-bodied wine smells like fresh berries, tastes fruity and mildly spicy and feels silky in the mouth. The components are beautifully balanced, as fresh acidity lifts the fruitiness and mild tannins add a velvety touch.
This wine doesn't have much going on. It's dried out, chalky in the mouth, stemmy and bitter with green tannins. The fruit is dried out and there is a scent of brett as well.
Barrel-fermented in 100% new oak, this is very full-bodied, a little too much so, as the citrus, fig and yeast flavors get bogged down with their own weight. Try instead another new release from the same proprietor, dubbed Le Petit Coquerel.
Great Pinot Noir, dry, silky and crisp in acidity, yet with enormously complex flavors. The cherries and pomegranates have an earthy connection by way of minerals and sweet herbs. Only an infant now, this elegantly polished wine should develop over the next six years.
The nose features some plum and faint cedar aromas, but not a lot of intensity; the light black-cherry and cedar flavors incorporate some earthy nuances on the finish. Light and correct, but where's the beef?
With an aroma like buttered toast and mouth-filling flavors like pear juice, this medium-bodied wine is generous and satisfying. The texture is soft and smooth, coating the mouth in a good way after each sip.
Drawn and leathery on the nose, and then as it opens it reveals citrusy red fruit aromas. The palate is lean and tight, with light cherry, raspberry and plum flavors. Toasty, dry and a bit buttery tasting on the finish.
Small amounts of Mourvèdre, Syrah, Counoise and Cinsault add complexity to this excellent Grenache, grown at the Ciel du Cheval vineyard on Red Mountain. Supple and aromatic, it expresses itself with ripe, sweet strawberry and black cherry fruit, whiffs of pepper and pencil lead, and a full-bodied midpalate that continues cleanly through a lingering finish.
Basic plum and black cherry aromas come with hints of baking spices and cinnamon. This feels a bit high in acidity and pinchy. While a quick wash of grapy, black-fruit flavors finishes without much noise.
Merriment is a Bordeaux-style blend with a simple mix of black cherry and chocolate flavors. It has a flat mouthfeel, with peppery, earthy undertones and some bitterness on the finish.
This wine is aromatically reticent with cocoa, berry, brown spices and light volatile notes. The palate is medium bodied with a thick feel and cranberry-like tartness.
Fruit on the nose has a pretty black-peppery finish, with just a hint of herbal brightness. Mocha, chocolate and eucalyptus are accents on the palate, which fades into sweet red berries, white pepper and oak on the finish.
Few Pinot Noirs are as delicious right out of the bottle. Dazzles with tiers of raspberry and cherry tart, smoky pie crust, cinnamon and nutmeg spices and a sweet squirt of vanilla. For all the richness, it's dry and crisp. Drink now with seared tuna, lamb chops, beef tenderloin.
A fresh, fruity wine, full of wild strawberry flavors, with cranberry tannins. The acidity is full on, but the ripe tannins edging through give structure and the promise of 2–3 years aging.
A scintillating scent of rose petals opens up this pleasing wine, which continues with raspberry and cherry fruit, accented with light milk chocolate. It is not a heavy wine; in fact, if Franc can ever be called elegant, even feminine, this is how it should taste. The finish falls off rather quickly, but otherwise it is a fine effort.
This is a really fruity, really refreshing sparkling wine. It boasts apple, citrus and a touch of apricot flavors, as well as tight acidity. It is fragrant, pure and clean, and very fresh on the finish.
Aromas suggest berry fruits, spice. A full, creamy, grabby palate is weighty, while flavors of varied black fruits are oaky and chocolaty. On the finish, this tastes roasted and a bit hot, with a note of salt. This is two-thirds Garnacha along with Syrah and Samsó (Carignan).
This lively, raspberry- and red-currant-flavored wine has just the right tang of acidity to create its crisp feel. Fruity and fragrant, it features a touch of minerality to add further texture.
A powerful, tannic wine, very dry and firm. Underneath the dry exterior, there are great fruits waiting to fully express themselves. It will always be a structured wine, the black fruits a serious component along with the spice from wood aging. Keep for 4–5 more years.
This isn't the most complex Côtes du Rhône, but it does offer bold, fruit-driven flavors of cherry and raspberry, medium body and tannins that are creamy soft. Drink this 50-50 blend of Grenache and Syrah over the next year or so.
A little scattered and jumbled at first, but once things settle this Bordeaux blend is impressive. Scents of clove, blackberry and grape candy are sincere, while the palate houses blueberry, cassis and other black-fruit flavors. The feel is tannic and a bit choppy, but the ribald finish of bacon, leather, vanilla and resin is convincing. Drink now through 2011.
Pinot Noir specialist Bryan Babcock explores this aromatic white grape, delivering a lush and creamy expression. Poached pear and orange blossom notes combine with a nutty quality on the nose, while the wine's creamy consistency meets buoyant acidity on the palate. Lush apple, pear and cashews flavors complete the picture.
Strong wood aromas mark this wine that's shot through with wood-aging flavors. Spice and smoky toast are evident, but the ripe blackberry flavors are big enough to balance this Merlot-dominated wine. Drink from 2017.
Daughter of Roger Belland, Julie has taken over and changed the name of this estate. Based in Santenay, they also have vines in other appellations. This wine, for instance, is rich and structured with just the right amount of wood aging. It has vanilla, spice and great acidity from the citrus and apple fruits. The wine is still young and will be best from 2018.
From a variety of coastal vineyard locations, this wine, an inaugural offering from the producer, opens in zesty lemon and tangerine, before developing into a fuller-bodied, unctuous experience on the palate. It offers tamped-down acidity and briny back note on the finish.
With just 4% Viognier, for better or worse it doesn't have that  lifted-aroma quality that Viognier usually lends these kinds of blends. Feel is rough at first but smoothes out; there's a fair dose of wood here. With air, blueberry flavors come to the fore. Still this is not a deep wine. Imported by Wilson Daniels Ltd.
Delicate and pillowy in effervescence, this Riesling sekt boasts remarkable nuance in texture and flavor. It's zesty and mineral on the nose, yet buoyantly fruity, chock-full of ripe peaches and Meyer lemons that seem laced in caramel and burnt sugar. It finishes long with lingering touches of pastry and lemon pith.
This impressive offering is crystal-clean and direct, with green apple, lime and petrichor notes that typify Riesling. It's medium bodied and fully dry, with a long, lime-riddled finish. Drink it over the next decade or so.
Enticing notes of ripe, red apple and a hint of fine marzipan lead onto an apple-fruited palate of immense fruity freshness. This is unusual, sprightly and full of life: a Zweigelt vinified as a white wine. Drink as soon as possible to make the most of the alluring primary fruit aromas.
With its searing crisp character, this is a wine for food. Very textured, apple skins cut through the citrus acidity, creating a taut, nervy wine, although finishing with a richer, more yeasty character.
Aromas of grilled herb, French oak, scorched earth and menthol lead the nose. The juicy, accessible palate offers Morello cherry, vanilla, orange peel and a hint of mocha alongside fine-grained but rather fleeting tannins. Drink through 2017.
The bright cherry-red color shows how young this wine is. It is firm, still full of its youthful tannic character. Dense and solid, it has great juicy acidity, layers of red berries with more weight coming from dark plum flavors. It needs aging; drink from 2017.
Lovely green notes of lime zest and greengage rise from the glass in this wine. The palate is light, juicy and fresh, with a dry and zingy finish. Ready for a summer party.
This juicy wine is packed with a black currant flavor, plus fragrant tannins and taut acids. Wood aging shows in the form of a bitter chocolate note. It will need to age for at least eight years.
The top wine from this estate is this release from the powerful 2010 vintage. It has a dense structure, dark tannins and rich texture. Ripe black plum and dark fig flavors along with the dry core means the wine is still developing. Drink from 2017.
This easy-drinking, value-minded wine offers notes of plum, tobacco, bell pepper and green herbs, with a vanilla top note. It's straightforward in style, with clunky tannins.
Negociant Nicolas Potel has made a specialty of sourcing old vines. In this wine, they are between 44 and 54-years-old. The wine is rich and concentrated—dark with tannins and generous with black fruits. It is firm and obviously needs to age. Drink this sold wine from 2020.
This large estate on the slopes above the river Garonne has produced a Merlot-dominated wine. It is rich while already finely balanced. It has juicy red fruits with a solid dry core that promises aging. Drink this wine from 2019.
A wine that delivers great freshness, a bright lemon and grapefruit character, tautly mineral in character, almost steely, with a pure line of green fruits. Age for 2–3 years.
With light flavors of ripe red fruits balanced by fresh acidity, this rosé sparkler is full in the mouth and deliciously fruity. A lively mousse gives lift to the fresh aftertaste.
You'll find lots of concentration in this dry, nicely drinkable wine, which opens with citrus and mineral aromas and an inviting waft of white chocolate. It's an earth-driven wine. The citrus flavors are strong but not overpowering. You get the impression of crushed fresh herbs: parsley, mint, cilantro. It's dry and crisp and an excellent white wine.
Elegant and bright, this shows extraordinary elegance and finesse. It delivers smoked aromas of crushed granite and tar, with notes of dried raspberry and crème de cassis. The young tannins are already silky and smooth.
Clear, light and varietal, this wine ping-pongs between subtle cinnamon and Asian spice around dark cherry and earth, with a big, juicy hit of oak and intense tannin. It finishes full-figured and robustly concentrated.
One of the winery's upper-end bottlings, this shows strawberries, dried fennel stalks and an earthy minerality on the nose. The flavors prove a bit cooked, with stewed berries, char, dark tobacco, dark chocolate and black pepper.
This mild-flavored wine delivers light apple, floral, almond and maraschino-cherry flavors, a smooth, soft texture and medium body. Although subtle, it does develop more complexity in the glass.
A properly steely, mineral-structured wine. It has citrus, pink grapefruit, green berries and a great core of tight fruits and acidity. With its green apple skin structure, this is vibrant and deliciously taut. Imported by Wilson Daniels Ltd.
One of the best-known Champagnes on the market, this tastes relatively dry. It isn't losing its bright, open fruitiness, but that quality now joins a structured, mineral-driven edge. This could work as an apéritif or it could be paired with food.
Aromas of black cherry and smoked meats lead to tastes of black cherry and vanilla. It is soft both on entry and finish.
Shows true Central Coast Pinot character in the high acidity, lightly silky texture and polished flavors of red cherries, cola, vanilla and spicy white pepper.
For a fruity sparkling wine, there's nothing wrong with this. Aromas of ripe apple and lychee precede a palate with weight. Residual sugar causes lychee, lime and apple flavors to come across as sweet, while the finish is steady and avoids being cloying.
With cherry, black raspberry, red currant and licorice flavors wrapped into an elegantly light body, this Merlot may appeal to consumers who find Cabernet Sauvignon too heavy. It's an easy commercial wine to drink now.
A distinctive wine with firm, brooding notes of black fruit, kirsch and dried Mediterranean herbs. This is a fine-grained and elegant wine with chiseled graphite nuances and rock-solid tannins. It has great potential: Drink after 2010.
Chewy and tannic, this rugged wine puts Pinot in Cabernet clothing. The black-cherry fruit carries a streak of cola, and a slight sense of rubber in the finish.
Pure notes of ripe but crisp pear on the nose turn into concentrated, herb-spiced pear and citrus notes on the palate: the ripeness of the pear vies with the zesty freshness and makes of a lively, vivid and most enjoyable and refreshing wine. This is crisp, light bodied but balanced and puts a little Austrian spring in your step.
Tastes fruity and tart in Lifesaver orange, lemon and apricot flavors, enriched with oak and brightened with beautifully crisp acidity. Feels strong and flattering now. Let it breathe in the glass.
This impressive wine, packed with both fruit and tannins, is just setting out on a long road of aging. It is rich, dense with dry fruit and wood tannins, and buttressed with dark black fruits layered with acidity. The wine, with its ripe fruit and firm structure, needs time. Drink from 2018.
A pale colored rosé, light and attractively crisp. Soft red fruits come through the gentle texture to give a wine that is ripe, fruity and ready to drink.
Aromas of oak, toast, espresso, vanilla and coconut carry over to the palate along with dark berry flavors and milk chocolate. It closes on a sweet, almost sugary note but it lacks energy and intensity.
Dense, with a substantial amount of tannin and oak upfront, this clone designate, 100% varietal, is chalky in texture and showy in oak. Red currant, cedar and an unfurling of tobacco leaf provide fruit and savory herbaceousness.
This is 75% Tempranillo and 25% Cabernet Sauvignon. It's got an unusual structure, and dramatically displays this biodynamic vineyard's funky, herbal, earthy character, with plenty of acidity from the Tempranillo, and a little bit of the tomato leaf character also. A complex, unique, distinctive wine that does not show fruit so much as earth and terroir. It keeps going, adding weight and depth through the midpalate, with a strong tomato component.
Made in an Old World style, this dry, earthy wine has aromas of vanilla and Asian spice, eucalyptus and earth that picks up secondary aromas with time. The tannins are developed, the wine having spent plenty of time in wood, while the palate has a medium weight and good acidity. Earth and eucalyptus dominate the mouth, supported by lesser flavors of red berry and cola, which linger on the long finish. This is a wine that needs a decanter or time in the glass to open up, and can be drunk over the next five years.
How dark this wine pours, with a purple glycerine that stains the glass. Aromatically, it's a powerhouse with heaps of violets, blackberry jam, raw meat and caramelly vanilla. In the mouth, acidity hits first, then fruit, and then the tannins lock everything down. Powerful but immature. Hold until 2010.
Lightly herbal and light in body, with earthy aromas that include leather, tea and dried fruits. This is medium-bodied in style, with elegance. Problem is, there isn't much substance to it and compared to Chile's better Cabs, it pales in flavor and generosity. Also, the finish is kind of scratchy and thin.
Herbaceous, lemony tones reverberate from start to finish on this elegant off-dry Riesling, accenting sweet, juicy peach and tangerine flavors. Hints of smoke and tea leaf add some complexity, along with a lime-pith astringency on the finish.
The winery has had some success with this Spanish variety, but the '05 is not one of their best efforts. The wine is thinly structured and harsh in tannins, with exaggerratedly sweet cherry, cola and currant flavors.
Dry and clean, with straw, hay and other cava-like aromas. Take away the bubbles and this Viura is indeed like cava, so expect green apple, citrus and other crisp, lemony flavors. As varietal Viura from Rioja goes, Faustino has crafted a wine that's well above average and mildly complex.
The nose on this ripe Tinta de Toro is dense, bold and brimming with black-fruit aromas. Following the nose, this tastes of blackberry, cassis and various spices, while finishing black-fruit flavors are lightly herbal, spicy and complex. This offers a touch of everything good, and even more when it comes to ripe fruit. Drink through 2024.
Huge, tremendous, authoritative and impressive for its sheer volume. It just explodes in blackberries, cassis, dark chocolate, leather, dried herb and smoky oak flavors, with a tangy minerality. The vineyard is in the Stags Leap tenderloin, and the wine combines an approachable drink-me-now quality with obvious ageworthiness through at least 2016. Only 180 cases were produced.
This is the second wine of Clos Haut-Peyraguey. It comes from a fine Sauternes vintage with a great balance between acidity and rich sweetness. With botrytis, plenty of sweetness, bitter marmalade and apricot fruit and delicious acidity, the wine is almost ready to drink. Just wait until the end of 2017.
Harsh and tannic now, with a flood of primary fruit blackberries and dark chocolate washed with black pepper. Despite the scour, it's a well-structured, bone-dry wine, with noble Napa tannins. And it is Petite Sirah. Give it at least four years in the cellar.
An impressive Cabernet, grown in a cool part of Paso Robles. Shows admirable dryness and control, with firm, fuzzy tannins housing classic blackberry and currant flavors.
Little or no oak masks the citrus, tart green apple and spicy fig flavors in this very dry, likeable wine. Tastes like it has lots of cool coastal grapes in it, to judge from the crisp acids that make it so clean.
From the grandest of Burgundy's white vineyards, this Le Montrachet sums up the 2006 white vintage. Its structure, freshness and richness rolls the wine around the mouth, offering citrus, bitter orange and yellow fruit flavors. Toast flavors round the wine, leaving a hugely satisfying aftertaste.
Black cherry, cocoa and toast mark the nose of this very dark and refined wine. The supple, appealing mouthfeel displays a similar flavor profile, and it closes with smooth tannins, tart black fruits and an espresso note. This example of new-wave Chianti is done with style and even a sensuous note.
Bright, vivid flavors like black cherry and cranberry make this wine taste fresh and alive. Medium body and a somewhat tart but polished texture balance it out.
Ripe yet restrained on the nose, offering fig and guava. On the palate, those flavors turn citrusy, picking up a hint of bitter pith on the finish.
Alluring scents of ripe berry, dark spice, toast, grilled herb and a balsamic note set the tone for this youthful Barolo. The full-bodied, tightly wound palate offers red cherry, white pepper cinnamon and sage alongside assertive tannins and fresh acidity. A licorice note caps the finish. Drink after 2019.
This larger-production wine is sourced from several single-vineyard sites, including Rodgers Creek, Sangiacomo and Gap's Crown. Together they find unity in fruit-forward flavors of blueberry, cherry and pomegranate, the oak persistent and powerful amidst a backdrop of tight-grained tannin. The concentration is pronounced.
Condensed aromas of blackberry, prune and raisin get a boost of darkness and depth from coffee and mocha. This feels tannic and firm, with mocha, coconut and other oak-based flavors. Finishing flavors of vanilla and coconut are full, bulky and rich. Drink through 2019.
Thin, green and tannic.
Remember when all Châteauneufs were priced like this? Now this is entry-level pricing, yet the wine is very good, delivering a complex, harmonious blend of leather, earth, spice and plum notes. It's soft enough to drink now and over the next few years.
A bruiser of a Merlot, dry and muscular, with green olive, blackberry, sage and smoky cedar flavors, wrapped into bigtime tannins. Even at the age of nearly 5 it's still brooding and hard. Not an ager, but there's something fine and polished about it now.

Coconut oil, lime blossoms, fermenting citrus, kaffir lime and cold steel aromas show on the nose of this bottling of a grape rarely planted on the Central Coast.

A smaller project from the Scheid family of wines, this single-vineyard expression offers a sanguine nose of blood, iodine, dirt, crushed violets and a touch of pungent juniper and pine. It's light and lithe on the palate, with pomegranate, cranberry and iron, proving to be a very fresh sipper.

A touch rosy and rusty in color, with a bouquet that exudes red fruit swaddled in oak and leather. Lively but simple in the mouth, with medium tannins and an undercurrent of charred brush. This is a true indigenous wine that won't register with a lot of people. Imported by Empson (USA) Ltd.
A tiny-production wine from a windblown ridge in the Petaluma Gap, Badger Block is earthy and piquant in wild strawberry. Spicy and soft, it's almost velvety on the palate. Persistent in depth and length, the body is generous but balanced, spiked with the scent of fresh-picked rose petals.

This is a stunning Pinot Noir, especially from a Syrah-focused winery.

Toasty and yeasty on the nose, and with a pale color and fine bead, at first glance this looks very promising. And truth be told, it is pretty good, just not as good as we'd want it to be. the flavors are nice, offering more toasty elements and a bit of anise, but the mouthfeel is heavy and lacks balancing crispness.

From a high altitude estate in the Vaucluse, this blend of 60% Grenache, 35% Syrah and 5% Cinsault is pale and coppery in hue, yet shows ample richness and weight on the palate. Notes of wet stone, berry and citrus linger on the mouthwatering finish.
This has a dry finish with modest alcohol, and its emphasis is on phenolic flavors rather than the usual floral-perfumed aromas that characterize most versions of the grape.

Chunky, forward fruit—a rush of blackberries and black cherry—introduces a full-flavored wine that won't challenge you but will satisfy. The oak treatment is still a little jagged, but the light mocha flavors that wrap around the finish are hard to resist.
Not a total success. It tastes both soft and hard at the same time; the fruit is tight, tart and tapers off quickly. Tannins are softened to the point of being inconsequential. The wine lacks grip.
A very dark color and extremely concentrated fruit flavors give this dry and firmly tannic wine a lot of substance.

A wine made from 30-year old vines, this is firm, solid and tannic. It feels weighty with a smooth texture that burrows deep into the black fruits and acidity. Fine acidity and a layer of spice complete this attractive wine that is worth aging for 3–5 years. Glass stopper
Firm, concentrated and tannic, this has a smoky character that contrasts the red plum and strawberry fruits. It is solid and chunky, needing to age over several years.
Not up to the quality of previous vintages of Firesteed's budget bottling, this 2007 seems like a washed-out also-ran. There is barely a hint of fruit; the flavors are thin and watery. There's nothing off here about the winemaking; it's just that the material was marginal from the start.
Wonderfully aromatic fruit rises from the glass: blueberry with cinnamon and violet overtones, hints of plum and pepper and a pervasive elderberry note.

Cesari's Mara Ripasso shows enormous richness and intensity that is underscored by polished aromas of mature fruit, spice, plum, mesquite and maraschino cherry. The wine does a very nice job of delivering both elegance and power.
There's a slightly charry, roasted or asphalt top note to this wine's aromas, but the wine's flavors are an intriguing mix of cola, rhubarb and red berries, ending with mouthwatering raspberries coming to the fore. It's a full-bodied, creamy-textured wine that should be enjoyed over the next few years.
Cherry and mint flavors are pleasant in this Cab, but green tannins give the palate a harsh feel.

This vineyard selection captures the defining character of this tiny AVA—an underlying streak of gun metal, and an overall austerity that belies the complexity and subtle length of the wine. Tart cranberry fruit brings supporting acidity, and the wine rewards your attention with extra length and detail. Drink 2018 to 2028.
This blend of 60% Sangiovese and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon is aged in oak for 40 months, which contributes dark, woody spice to the nose, enhancing the fresh-pressed elderberry and crushed lava-rock aromas. The sip is soft at first before the tannins tighten around the dark flavors, and the acidity is powerfully fresh. Give it a tad more time for all components to marry. Drink 2019–2028.
Always a favorite from this Walla Walla producer, the 2005 Merlot includes about 6% Cabernet Franc.

The style is deep, dark, laced with graphite, and definitely built for long -term cellaring.
A blend of Syrah, Cabernet Franc, Merlot and a dollop of Petit Verdot, this has subtle aromas of ground pepper, toast, French oak and espresso. The aromas follow over to the rather lean, straightforward palate along with a note of fresh cherry set against loose-knit, fine-grained tannins. Enjoy over the next few years.

Soft, plum and cherry fruit scents, augmented with hints of rose petal and cranberry. In the mouth it's lean and insubstantial, with a hard, tannic finish.

Almost three-quarters Cab, with Merlot rounding out the balance. Shows cola, wheat bread and a hint of wintergreen on the nose, and tight red fruit and earth flavors on the palate. A smooth, claylike feel completes the picture. Very nice, and more tight than plump. Imported by Clos Du Val Wine.
Lemony and a touch chemical, but for $8 it's more right than wrong. The flavors are citrusy and austere, much like white grapefruit and gooseberry. But the palate has some plumpness, and the finish, while pithy, is honest.
Dark in the glass, this bottling shows strawberry, black plum and gingerbread aromas on the inviting nose. The mouthfeel is airy and relatively light, with a strong tannic tension that frames flavors of dark purple fruit and baking spice.

Ultraripe blueberry and raspberry notes mingle with specks of black pepper on the soft and mildly grippy palate. The is light bodied and easily quaffable.
This wine just gets better with every new vintage. Young and fresh, it hits the palate with lip-puckering acidity, rolling on flavors of lemons, oranges, citrus rind, and then into mango and papaya. Though the residual sugar is listed at 1.6%, it shows only in a pleasing roundness in the lengthy finish. Delicious now, but entirely cellar-worthy for a decade or longer.
Structured despite its impermeable presence of power and alcohol, this wine also sings in crisp red fruit, some of it jammy, but self-possessed. An accompaniment of anise and baked bread play on the sturdy palate.
Grassy notes of green conference pear with incredibly ripe overtones of yellow plum give a fruity but non-tropical spin on Sauvignon Blanc. A strident vein of acidity keeps everything superfresh and lively. Vibrant and full of fruit, this shows what Sauvignon Blanc can do in the right climate in the right hands. The lingering citrus and fruit finish just calls for another sip.
The wine has a light, silky texture, low alcohol and the brisk acidity of the Central Coast. With savory raspberry and vanilla flavors, it's ready to drink now.

A neutral white with measured almond, stone fruit and green, clover-like notes. It's easy to drink and an easy match for finger foods or appetizers. Imported by Empson (USA) Ltd.
The melon, apple and pear aromas aren't as distinctively Viognier as one might expect, but the wine itself is solid and satisfying. The flavor profile is spicy and melony, and feel-wise there's lots of size. (This whopper weighs in at 14.9%, so it should seem big.)  A large, chewy yet mildly buttery finish seals the package as full bodied and rich.
A brilliant wine, massively sculpted and monumental, that shows how great this vineyard is. The wine shows densely concentrated flavors of blackberries and licorice, with the loveliest accent of sweet worn leather and rhubarb, flourished with the dusty spices that always characterize a fine Santa Maria Pinot Noir.

A tiny percentage of Verdiso is added to the blend, lending this a bright green note of lime and honeydew. This Prosecco also shows extra depth and structure.

Here's an excellent value from Central Italy. This plush and rich Montepulciano shows soft fruit and cherry surrounded by very spicy and savory notes of nutmeg, cardomam and turmeric. It would pair nicely with meat sauce, ground beef or meatloaf.
Rich and generous, this is purely indulgent Merlot. The sweet fruit balances with sweet, almost opulent and well-integrated tannins, and ripe plum flavors. There is some dryness right at the heart of the wine; a pleasure of a wine.
This was a hard vintage, especially in cool places like Monterey, and this Syrah-Grenache blend is decidedly lean. There's enough raspberry fruit to get by, but green mint and vegetable flavors distract.
Initial brambly berry aromas are partnered with hints of smoky bacon and caramel sauce. The flavors are solid and ripe but not overdone, with attractive notes of blackberry and wild cherry. The medium tannins and ample acidity lend good balance and texture to the wine, while a pleasant astringency lingers on the finish.
This intriguing and delicious wine includes 15% Viognier, the two grapes spending nine months in French oak, only 30% of it new. The oak provides structure and strength in unobtrusive ways, allowing the freshness of pomelo and grapefruit to speak and remain tangy against a tease of vanilla. The finish is dry and lengthy.
This hearty, sturdy and flavorful red tastes dry, with firm tannins and good acidity. The aromas are a bit like wood smoke but not in an over-oaked way, and the flavors are like pomegranate and cranberry juice.
Spicy, toasty wine that balances the wood with rich fruit. Rounded, smooth texture, lifted by wood spice and apricot juice.
Cherry-rhubarb juice, shiitake mushrooms, sagebrush and iron make for a lush and layered nose on this appellation-blend wine that is widely available. The palate begins with plush red cherry then dives into oregano, sage and mace spice. It's expertly complex for a reasonably priced wine.

Drink now, with several hours of decanting, or cellar through 2020.

The honeyed notes on the nose almost have a savory soy-scented quality. These savory notes of stone and yeast also hover on the palate which is dry and replaces primary fruit with honeyed fluidity against the canvas of yeasty autolysis. This works not only as a dry refreshing apéritif but as an accompaniment to delicate foods.
This is a solid, huge wine, with rich but very dry tannins. With its dense, almost black color, and its sense of brooding power, it promises long aging. It will never be in the opulent Bordeaux camp, despite its prominent new wood flavors, but will probably outlive all but a handful top wines.
Not many Douro whites get the heavy bottle treatment like this fine wood-aged wine. It is a half-and-half blend of Gouveio and Viosinho, ripe and with layers of toast and intense yellow fruits as well as citrus acidity. It is just ready to drink although it will be better from 2017.

No doubt about it, this is a big, lusty Pinot Noir. From a low-production parcel of the estate, it routinely produces immensely concentrated wines. The winemaker's challenge is to give balance and harmony to grapes of this heft, and here, Iron Horse has it figured out.

This has already reached its peak drinking window so enjoy soon.

A rustic, everyday Cabernet, with enough blackberry and oak flavors to pass. It's rough in the mouth, with jagged tannins and an ashy note that's weird.
Rich, spicy and perfumed, this delicious wine is developing well and also has aging potential. It is packed with berry and plum fruits that parade with acidity and tannins that act as a support. It's still dense and the balanced fruit and tannins will allow it to age. Drink from 2018.

A wave of pleasant but light cherry, blackberry and sage offers a powerful but not overpowering opening. The palate is juicy and fresh, with controlled cherry and a touch of buttered toast. Round and medium in size on the finish, with solid but correct tannins.
From vines more than 50 years old, this is a surprisingly lush, forward Cornas from a vintage known at most domaines for its hard tannins. Black cherry fruit surrounds a core of dense mineral flavors, with light touches of wood on the finish. It's approachable now but should easily hold until at least 2015.
This copper-colored rosé is based on 85% Pinot Gris and 15% Syrah. It smells of dried apricot and cantaloupe, while the palate feels fleshy and round. Moderately complex flavors of salt water and stone fruits finish full.
A new offering made entirely from estate fruit, this is a selection of the best blocks and barrels of the vintage, with its core component being 90% Howell Mountain Cabernet Sauvignon.

A solid Pinot for drinking now, this polished young wine shows the bright acidity, dryness and pure fruit associated with the Edna Valley. Lovely cherry pie flavors, with the smoky sweet crust, and marvelous pie spices.

Here's an everyday red wine, dry and fruity, with a simple structure. It's sweet throughout, from ripeness and oak.
The vineyard isn't well-known but deserves to be. It's down the hill from Bien Nacido, in the sweet spot of Santa Maria Valley. Loring's '06 bottling is rich and ripe in cherries, currants, cola and tobacco, but more than that, has a textural complexity that gives it great interest value. Should age, too. Drink now–2012.
Berry, olive, spice and herbal aromas are typical of Chilean Cabernet. Scratchy tannins and medium overall weight make for some roughness, while raspberry and red-plum flavors finish herbal and spicy.
This is a great showing of how Chardonnay can work in Temecula. Fresh Meyer-lemon blossoms meet with lemon curd, clarified butter and vanilla paste on a tangy yet rich nose. Marcona almonds, apple custard, white peach and lightly toasted marshmallows show on the palate, balanced by just enough acid.
Chocolate and plum mingle enticingly in this medium-bodied offering from the warm (relative to Willamette) Umpqua Valley. Subtle herb notes and a peppery, crisp finish keep this wine interesting from start to finish.
There's a distinct suggestion of citrus pith on the nose of this bottling, along with tight almond and sea salt aromas. The palate leads with a touch of ripeness, but finds a firm structure and chalky backbone, proving rather racy, albeit with hazelnut-like richness. A well polished wine.
Robust and brawny, this substantial offering features concentrated layers of smoke, leather and sage-inflected tannins. It finishes in a wrapping of bittersweet chocolate.

This hovers on the verge of overripeness, with a hint of raisin, but it wisely pulls back at the last second into a luscious fortress of blackberry, cassis, chocolate and sweet smoky oak. So smooth and luxurious on the palate, the texture dazzles, despite some heat. The all-important tannins are nearly perfect. Drink now–2016, especially with steak.
Marchesale is an excellent Syrah with an inky, black appearance and intense aromas of blueberry, plum, prune, black pepper and crushed stone. The wine shows incredible richness and density and lasts long on the palate thanks to its firm, succulent tannins.
The aromas combine fresh lemon and apple notes with just a hint of butter. The flavors are similarly fresh and crisp, with a tangy feel and great balance. It will be easy to match now with salads, seafood and appetizers, and worth cellaring a few bottles to see how it matures.
Chestnut Hill is the winery's highest-elevation vineyard, and in a fine vintage such as this, it merits reserve-level treatment. It would be wonderful if more Oregon wineries made Pinot Gris of this caliber, and could sell it at an approachable price, but it's a tough category. Latch onto this rich and concentrated gem if you can; it's a gorgeous mix of apple, pear, chalk and lightly toasted almonds.
This steely, tangy wine has a strongly mineral character—tight, taut and crisp. Green fruits, citrus and a grassy character dominate. It is ready to drink. This is an unusual 75% Sémillion and 25% Sauvignon Blanc blend that tends to round out the taste.
Tight and crisp initially, this wine opens up with spice, ripe flavors and a touch of minerality. Taut and textured, it needs to age; drink from 2017.

This shows a bold and modern personality, with spicy oak tones behind bright notes of cherry, chocolate and chewy raspberry. It shows savory endnotes of pipe tobacco, leather and prune.
This is quite a delicious wine. It's not supersweet, and has long, deep flavors of ripe apricots, white chocolate and vanilla, with a crème brûlée richness that seems equal parts fruit and smoky oak. The acidity is keen, providing balancing relief to the sweetness. Fabulous with a butter cookie or shortbread and vanilla ice cream.
A good, strong, sturdy wine, filled with classic blackberry, black currant and cassis flavors. It's dry and rich, but the tannins are aggressive. They're edgy and tough and off-putting. It may be the kind of old-fashioned wine that comes around after 10 or 15 years.

If you're tired of sweet, soft California reds, turn here. The wine is dry and acidic. It's also a bit hot, with a baked fruit, raisiny edge to the cherry fruit, but it does have an elegant complexity. Drink now.
After a period of volatility, Hommage, which is the winery's highest expression of Cabernet, returns to form. At the age of six years, it's soft and mellow, although still rich in tannins, with blackberry, chocolate, plum and cassis liqueur flavors that are deep and long in the finish. Made from 100% Cabernet, it's stylishly delicious now, and should develop for 6–8 years, although the softness mitigates against longterm aging.
This structured wine is slow to show its fruity side although it has a layer of acidity with hints of black fruits. It is firm and dry at the moment with dense tannins and a dark aftertaste. Wait until 2017.
This full-bodied, concentrated wine is dry, quite firm and tannic in texture. It smells rich and a bit earthy, and tastes like blackberries, cranberries and beef. The style will accompany rich, meaty food very well.
Produced at Domaine la Gemière, the wine is soft, rounded and easy to drink young. It has a lively edge to the ripe citrus and apple fruitiness. It is open and ready to drink.
This big, thick, oaky Zinfandel is powerful in flavor and not particularly subtle. It overwhelms with truckloads of blackberry and cherry jam, stewed plums, chocolate, mocha, pepper and cedar, and stings the palate with hard, astringent tannins and heat. The suggestion is ageability, but it's a gamble beyond 2012.
Dark tobacco tones and spice open the austere bouquet of this dark and well extracted Sangiovese Riserva. The wine is redolent of tar, spice, black fruit, cola and resin. It's very masculine and muscular for this otherwise gentle grape.
An austere wine with a stalky character, showing firm tannins and a strong mineral character of Douro schist. It is like a sweet table wine, spiced and structured, needing to age.
Prickly, briny citrus aromas announce a juicy, acidic wine that dances on the palate while delivering flavors of lime, briny apple and nettle. Things stay prickly and turn bitter on the back side. 50% each Verdejo and Viura.

Floral aromas mixed with citrus notes are appealing. This wine feels round but solidified by bright core acidity. Ripe flavors include pineapple, mango and peach. On the finish, lime and tropical notes are good but short.
This huge, rich wine is great Grüner Veltliner. Despite the alcohol, Rupert Summerer has managed to keep the intense freshness, the lifted, crisp pear flavors and the exuberant pepper in control. Impressive.
Aromas of underbrush, tobacco leaf, leather, wild berry and a balsamic note take the lead. The palate offers juicy Morello cherry, black raspberry, licorice and sage alongside rather astringent tannins.
This is a fine example of where Washington's best Malbecs are heading. Though labeled Columbia Valley, it's got a fair amount of Walla Walla fruit in it, notably a 5% component of Spofford Station Syrah. Sharp-edged, tight and spicy, this just hints at earth and seaweed, and has not yet shed its baby fat.
Smelling this wine is like sticking your nose into a jar of turmeric, with added aromas of ground coffee bean and broad black fruit that shade in the background. While the turmeric note remains dominant on the palate, the wine would pair well with spicy curry dishes—especially considering its modest 12% alcohol.
This blend of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cab Franc opens with rustic, untamed earth and leather aromas. On the palate, however, it is more tame and balanced, with ripe, rich depth and cushion. Flavors of blackberry, chocolate and toast finish with simmering heat and chunky weight. Drink through 2021.
Fine and supple, this Pinot combines grace and power with plenty of flavor. It's forward in jammy cherry, raspberry, rose, lavender and cola, and the finish is long and sweet. The wine is balanced with firm tannins and crisp acidity.

An attractive rosé, made from 100% Castelão, the local grape of Setúbal peninsula. It is crisp with citrus and ripe with raspberry giving a fine balance and refreshing character. Drink now.
The beautiful château at Citran has been renovated, as has the vineyard. As a result, the wines are worth looking out for, even in a lesser vintage. The wine has tannins, but the fruit is also fresh, with red fruit flavors. This is not a heavyweight, but will be attractive in 3–5 years.
Everything about this Syrah is fine except the softness. It's dry, rich in tannins and properly flavored, with layered notes of blackberries, cassis, dark chocolate, black pepper and dark chocolate. But it feels lifeless in the mouth, lacking the vivacity a fine Syrah needs.
Made by Ross Cobb and Katy Wilson, a rockstar winemaking team, this Pinot is earthy and spicy, a light, softly textured example of the complexity and nuance possible out of the cooler sites of the Sonoma Coast. Dark in color and savory it's made in small quantities, but do try and seek, then let it develop in the glass over time.
A nice wine with real varietal character, a smooth mouthfeel, crisp acids and ripe flavors of raspberries, cherries and mocha. Try this as a first course leading up to the expensive stuff.

Sharp cinnamon and squeezed pomegranate aromas mix with strawberry blossoms and dried cherries on the nose of this wine from the longtime regional producer. The palate is driven by chaparral aromas of wild sage, coyote brush and juniper, spicing up the red-fruit flavors.
Fiery smelling at first, with aromas of mint, raw oak, coconut and baked berry fruits. Feels rich almost to the point of syrupy, with spicy, lightly green flavors infiltrating the core of cassis and berry. Finishes herbal and stalky, with a lingering green flavor.
Much as I love the winery's La Paulée, this tops it. There's more concentration and complex blueberry, mulberry, black cherry and plum flavors. It shows a whiff or two of mint, sage and chervil, and as with all Scott Paul wines it is impeccably balanced, non-interventionist and studiously clean.
A fresh sparkling wine, this has a bright bouquet of stone fruit, citrus and white flower. It's simple and lightweight, with a touch of spice.
Pinchy, staunch citrus and briny aromas are gritty and lacking in fresh fruit notes. Tight citric acidity makes this austere, while juicy but bitter flavors of orange and lime are tangy but pithy-tasting on the finish.
Produced from 25-year-old vines, this is a delicious, crisp and clean wine. It has attractive apricot and melon flavors that are cut with lime acidity. Drink this fruity wine now.
Made from old vines, this concentrated wine has weight and a tight, mineral texture. Pears and hints of yellow fruits combine with acidity and a contrasting touch of honey. Drink from 2015.
Deep gold in color, a big, generous and opulent wine. It has rich yellow and tropical fruits and layers of botrytis, emphasizing power. Luckily, the acidity is also there to freshen the finish.
This is a super-ripe, rich wine that's very full in the mouth. It has an opulent feel to it, while also retaining acidity and crisp lemon and apple flavors. The aftertaste brings out pepper as well as a more mineral character. Drink from 2014.
This is an attractive blend of Grenache and Syrah, giving a smooth wine that has just the right amount of acidity. Red currant and Bartlett pear flavors give the wine its fruity side. It is ready to drink.
Peach and apple aromas are modest. The palate is juicy and citric in feel, while flavors of melon, apple and nectarine finish tangy, with a citrusy taste.
This has pure fruit – strawberry especially – creating an elegant, light, delicate, complex, though still quite young wine. Some caraway seed flavors come into play, and bolder black cherry fruit.
Rich, elegant and classic, this wine is made from fruit sourced from old vines—some as much as 70 years old. It has a tannic structure, but the dominant elements are the dense red- and black-plum flavors, which are supported by the wine's acids. Age it for 5–6 years.
This wine has the plucky character typical of Greece, but with a polished spin. The nose is allspice, cherry and cocoa, and on the palate, dried fruits, coffee, mesquite smoke and chocolate. The wine finishes spicy and clean. Good, if not a bit aggressive. Pair with meat or hearty fare.
Simple and sweet, with raspberry and cola flavors, this Pinot has a lot to offer. But it lacks structure and dryness. Drink now.
Starts out sort of soft and shy, with modest red-fruit aromas. In the mouth, raspberry and cherry flavors get a quick lift from grabby, firm tannins. And by the time this baby hits its groove you're onto a finish defined by a starchy feel and long-lasting Cabernet essence. Airing is this wine's best friend; decant or drink over time.
Torrontés is usually a one-year wine, so this 2011 is showing well via flowery white-fruit aromas and notes of lychee and bath oil. The palate is largely fresh and full, with melon, lychee and tangerine flavors. A touch of wheat flavor and creaminess on the finish are the lone indications of age.
This soft wine is a blend of two local white grapes: Síria and Fonte Cal. Intense acidity and a cool-climate feel from the high- altitude vineyards make this crisp, with grapefruit and lemon flavors. Drink now.
A home run. Given extra bottle age, this is drinking optimally at the moment, with a spicy, brambly nose mixing blackberries, mint and chocolate-covered cherries. There's a scent of fresh cut wood also, and a mouthful of fruit and barrel flavors that are both nicely integrated and complementary. The long finish lingers into a resonant note of black tea.
A blend of 80% Chardonnay and 20% Pinot Bianco, this has sensations of yellow apples, beeswax, citrus and mineral. It's simple but well made and would work well with lightly seasoned fish or pasta dishes topped with vegetable sauces.
Toasty aromas of wood shavings, menthol, cola and blackberry compose the nose. This is flush and wide on the palate, with blackberry, coffee, chocolate, toast and molasses flavors. It feels a little soft, so drink now.
Produced from vines in the hills above the Côte de Nuits, this is an attractively cool wine. It has lively acidity and a crisp mineral texture. With its white-fruit flavors, it is a wine with weight as well as crispness. Drink now.
The gigantic flavors are there, showing the exotic, flamboyant side of Viognier. Peach, pineapple, kiwi, Key lime pie, honeysuckle blossom, roasted almond, smoky new oak and Asian spices lead to a dry, honeyed finish. There's an edgy awkwardness, though, that limits elegance. Might simply be too young. Best after mid-2008.
This North Coast Cab opens with fragrant cranberry aromas and has a decent level of texture and structure, but devolves into slightly green territory and a confusing finish of coffee.
Hints of soy and pepper color the generously ripe notions of yellow pear and red apple on the nose. The palate reinforces the spiciness with more shimmering white pepper and the ripeness with extra juiciness. This is rounded but fresh, and just so full of sunny friendly fruit. The appetizing and moreish finish returns to that initial soy-like spice.
Made from a blend of Nero d'Avola, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, the 35th anniversary edition of this iconic wine opens with aromas of earth, leather, black currant and bell pepper. Black cherry, chocolate, cocoa and black pepper all weave together seamlessly on the elegant palate, alongside silky tannins.
A delicious wine, full of the freshest berry fruits, reticent tannins, and a bright, vibrant berry character, balanced with easy sweetness. Perfect for drinking now.
Runcaris is the easiest of Fattori's three Garganega-based wines. It shows beautiful notes of citrus and honeydew melon with flavors of white peach and a touch of exotic fruit. The wine does show pretty aromatic intensity.
This Rhône-style blend will uplift an ordinary cheeseburger, but has the complex power to match a big beef stew or game dish. Dry in style but big in alcohol, it's smooth and rich with luxurious blackberry, cherry, currant, mocha, black pepper and oak flavors.
Reduced aromas of iodine, latex and blackberry lead to a tannic, grabby palate with baked blackberry, licorice and rooty flavors. A warm, stewy, earthy finish is where grabby tannins dominate. This is a bold, powerful wine that could benefit from some cellaring time.
This presents a big, buttery, bold style, with no apologies for the full body and ripe fruit surrounded by toasty, oaky aromas and flavors. This is dry, rich in texture, and more savory or smoky rather than fruity.
Dark ruby to the eye, this wine offers a nose of raspberry, talc and violet. There is a nice mix of baking spice and fruit flavors, dominated by blackberry, black cherry, clove and anise with touches of black pepper. The finish is reminiscent of cherry pie, with mingling flavors of cherry, spice and vanilla.
There's an earthy note of white mushroom or cured meat that is followed by bright freshness in the mouth. Pair this easy Barbera with cheesy pasta or pizza.
Gritty white-fruit aromas show a note of vanilla. This tastes of bland passion fruit, with a weedy note thrown in. On the finish, this doesn't give much at all.
Mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, with some Cabernet Franc and Merlot, this wine is exuberantly rich and sweet in ripe blackberry, black cherry and chocolate fruit. Smoky oak plays a crucial role, in both flavors and texture. It's a very pretty, polished wine, elegant and balanced and ready to drink now. Production was a hefty 11,000 cases.
Underbrush, smoke, mocha and dark fruit aromas lead the nose and carry over to the ripe palate along with dried black cherry, licorice and clove. Firm, velvety tannins provide the framework. Drink 2018–2028.
A brilliant Syrah, showing its cool-climate origins with a burst of white pepper. Much of the fruit comes from the Bien Nacido Vineyard, and the Syrah contains 4% Viognier. Firm tannins and fine acidity give this delicious wine structure, but it's mostly notable for the extraordinary depth and length of its blackberry, currant, teriaki beef, mushroom and cedar flavors. The wine easily stands up to 100% new French oak casks.
Vividly pink in color, this is a light and sweet wine. There is a sugary aftertaste followed by fresh, crisp acidity.
Superfruity and jammy, with massive raspberry, cherry, blackberry and dark chocolate flavors, accented with black pepper. The texture is soft and voluptuous. This Syrah is a bit direct now, with its primary fruit and oak overlay, and it's a little hot, with an official alcohol reading of 15.5%.
The nose on this wine, which is now being made by former Harlan Estate cellar master Adam Henkel, is fresh and boisterous with lime sorbet and lemon glacé aromas. The palate is clean and crisp yet quite tropical, with sweetgrass, mango and papaya flavors.
A young firmly tannic wine still influenced by its wood aging. The berry fruits are ripe and chunky with a licorice and nutmeg character. It needs aging over several years.
Coconut, green herbs and fresh-cut wood work the nose, followed by fairly herbal berry flavors. There is oak throughout, and mildly coarse tannins, thus the structure is solid.
Refined aromas of toasted vanilla, spicebox, plum and tobacco are followed by vibrant waves of cherry, olive, dried herb and tobacco. The wine is elegant but has soul.
A richly perfumed wine, with delicious flavors of raisins, dried plums and sweet tannins. It is an opulent wine, the acidity keeping a watchful eye over the ripeness. It is ready to drink now.

This is a rich stylish wine from the Chanfreau family. It has fine tannins and signs of wood aging, both of which will meld into the juicy black-currant fruits. It has a predominance of Cabernet Sauvignon that gives the wine its structure and aging potential. The aftertaste is ripe and still crisp, still young. Drink from 2020.
Aromas of cedar, plum, red currant, clove and menthol unfold in the glass. An easy-drinking blend of 45% Merlot, 40% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% Sangiovese, the juicy palate delivers black cherry, blackberry, ground pepper and licorice alongside soft, polished tannins. Drink through 2018.
Tastes young and acidic but weirdly ripe now, with jammy raspberry, cherry and cola flavors and a tart finish. The question is whether it will age. Unlikely, but you never know.
This wine's macerated cranberry, raspberry jam and dried orange peel aromas are bright. Its raspberry and cranberry flavors are sweet and focused, delivering a lot of appeal, though seeming a bit ripe.
Deep, earthy and minerally, with tight black fruit aromas, clarity, focus and palpable quality pouring off the bouquet. The palate is layered and pure, with acidic kick, fine tannins and proper weight. With attractive flavors of dark berries, vanilla and a multitude of spices, this remains the benchmark for Chilean Malbec. 500 cases made; drink now through 2015.
This is an impressively rich and ripe within the light, poised character of classic Muscadet. It balances floral apple and pear fruit with a tight, mineral texture that gives the wine a young character. The extended lees aging has added notes of almonds and spice to this ripe wine. Drink from 2017.
This is a light and streamlined Ripasso that offers the elegance of Valpolicella with the power and intensity of this traditional school of winemaking. The wine delivers interesting aromas of black fruit, cola and resin but there's also a touch of green olive or caper at the back.
This popular brand's white version is soft and smooth. There are some citrus flavors to give the wine a crisp edge, although the main thrust of the wine is more towards apricot and perfumed green plums. Drink now.
Gloriously rich and decadently drinkable, but oh-so tannic. The fruit is dazzlingly good, flooding the mouth with the essence of ripe cherries, raspberries, mocha and red plums, while oak adds even richer notes. Somehow, the wine finishes dry and clean. But those tannins are sticky. Cellar it until 2015 or so.
Already a touch toasty, this is not as searingly dry as some Zéro Dosage Champagnes. Mind you, there is no doubt it is dry, the crisp apple, grapefruit and taut structure all confirming that. In the end, though, it has weight along with lively acidity.
Cullen's Diana Madeline is amazingly consistent from year to year, and the 2006 continues that tradition. It's maybe a touch fuller-bodied and rounder than some years, but maintains a sense of restraint and a timeless blend of tobacco, cedar and cassis, finishing with a flourish of mint.
The light aromas suggest notes of star fruit and citrus. The palate is flavorful, with racy acids keeping the fruit in focus.
Petit Barone changes the blend signficantly from vintage to vintage. Here it's a Bordeaux-style mix of 49% Cabernet Sauvignon, 32% Merlot, 17% Cab Franc and 2% Petit Verdot, aged two years in half new French and American barrels. The oak comes through with strong flavors of licorice, espresso and char, along with some fairly stiff, chalky tannins. But there is generous fruit—black cherry and cassis—and the wine delivers a lot of big, powerful flavor for the modest tariff.
Cavanera is Firriato's Mount Etna estate, and its flagship wine, Cavanera, is a traditional blend of Nerello Mascalese and Nerello Cappuccio. It offers small berry aromas of wild strawberry and raspberry with drying nuances of talcum power and crushed stone.
Pithy citrus and an oily aromatic note give this white blend some funk on the nose. The palate is in good shape but typical in terms of feel and weight. Flavors of orange, papaya and mango finish with citrusy notes of lime as well as chalky minerality. This wine holds Parellada, Macabeo and Chardonnay.
Raspberry and cherry aromas introduce this pink-tinted rosé. A chewy, full palate feels round and balanced, while flavors of briny berry and cherry finish bouncy and good, with a touch of residual sweetness. Drink now.
Substantially tannic and robust in tar and tobacco, this wine smells and tastes big and broad, a good choice for generous cuts of meat, preferably grilled. Black cherry and blackberry expand in waves around the oak and tobacco.
A softly polished wine that's ready to enjoy soon, this shows classic aromas of black fruit, spice, tobacco leaf and underbrush. It has a delicious black-cherry flavor, punctuated with black pepper, clove and a hint of bitter almond.
This is herbal and clipped smelling, with a scattering of berry and plum notes. It feels saturated and chewy, with roasted berry, pepper and spice flavors that lead to a lightly herbal finish, with a rubbery accent and a baked fruit note.
91—93 Barrel sample. Dense, balanced wine with great layers of black fruits. This is rich, relatively concentrated for the year, a wine that shows the acidity as a positive addition.
A bright, tight, citrus-flavored wine, with a great mineral streak over fresh, creamy acidity. There are lovely wafts of fresh apple juice. A delicious wine.
This sweet, Moscato-based offering would pair well with fruit-based dessert, panna cotta, or crème caramel. It offers loads of floral intensity, a lightly fizzy mouthfeel and low alcohol.
This is a blend of 67% Syrah and 33% Cabernet Sauvignon from Red Willow and Dineen, respectively. Though it falls on the lighter side for Washington Syrah, it's proportionate and pleasing, with strawberry fruit, mocha and toast. Tannins are fine and slender; though drinking well now, this could be cellared for awhile longer.
A good buy at this price for a dry, crisp wine of considerable charm. It's layered in Meyer lemon, lime, peach, green apple, honey and vanilla flavors, and finishes long and spicy.
So peppery and spicy, with such a briary mouthfeel, this wine could almost be Zinfandel. Even though it's not particularly Cabernet-ish, it's still quite a nice wine, rich, complex in tannin and dry. Drink over the next few years.
As it smells blowsy, stalky and oily, this is probably already past its freshness point. It feels chunky and sort of flat, with mealy apple flavors leading to a honeyed finish that feels fleshy. This is a blend of 50% Viura, 40% Chardonnay and 10% Muscat.
Powerful scents of toast and buttered popcorn dominate the nose, but once in the mouth the wine shows some grip and depth. For those who love the buttery style of Chardonnay, this will be hard to beat at this price. Traces of apple and pear fruit show in the midpalate, and the wine lingers gracefully into a full-bodied finish.
This red-label cuvée is made exclusively from estate-grown fruit. Lively and aromatic, it carries a streak of beetroot threaded through blackberry fruit. It's tight and tense, like a coiled spring, suggesting that some additional bottle age will help to open it up. The concentration is impressive, and the flavors continue on through a lengthy finish, with a suggestion of gunmetal as it subsides.
Popcorn, paint thinner and other oak-driven aromas control the nose on this resiny, woody wine. Like the nose, the flavor profile is barrel dominated. It finishes with resin, sawdust and bitter flavors.
Mixed berry fruit flavors have an over-ripe, pruney character. A dark streak of smoke, licorice and chocolate runs straight through the core and the tannins turn a little bitter and rough. Drink now.
Fresh toast and citrus aromas indicate a wine that is both full-bodied and balanced. The wood is very evident at this stage, giving a firm, toasty character. There are white peaches and citrus flavors, and long-lasting, refreshing acidity to finish.
This medium-bodied wine is easy-going and easy to drink. It smells and tastes like raspberries and red grapes, feels soft in texture and has a mellow fruitiness.
Soft bubbles and bracing acidity meld with sweet-tart wild-berry and red-cherry flavors in this cheeky, effervescent treat. A pétillant naturel fermented on it's own indigenous yeasts, there's a distinctly untamed, sauvage feel to this Merlot sparkler that's hard to resist.
This engages the taste buds with bright, ripe fruit flavors and balances them with good crisp acidity and light tannins, plus spicy oak accents that resemble vanilla, allspice and nutmeg. Medium to full bodied, it feels smooth in the mouth but the lip-smacking tannins carry through on the finish.
Brisk nectarine and just a touch of apple frame the nose, and warmer, expressive flavors of peach make for a perfect poolside beverage.
Opens with a sweet opulent nose driven by aromas of plump cherry, moist pipe tobacco, chocolate fudge, vanilla bean and ground espresso. But the wine is not modern or overtly international in terms of its style. It shows deep roots in Montalcino tradition and a bold, overt personality. Earth, leather and dried tobacco drive the finish.
Brisk and simple, this vibrant red has aromas and flavors of tart red berry, rose and an herbaceous note. It's on the lean side, with bracing acidity and fleeting tannins that give it an abrupt finish.
This is a beautifully ripe wine, full of melon and apricot fruits as well as fine crisp acidity. There is a little touch of pepper to give the wine piquancy. Drink this attractive wine now.
Wet and citrusy is the most generous way to describe this one. It's foxy and round but going nowhere. Best to wait for 2006.
Pear and honeydew melon aromas lift out of the glass. On the fresh, tangy palate, a saline vein of minerality underscores white peach, yellow apple and juicy citrus flavors.
Rich and tart, this is a delightful Pinot Noir for drinking now. Feels upscale in the mouth, with flavors of spicy raspberry, red currant, cola and sandalwood. Shows the elegance that almost always accompanies a Robert Mondavi wine.
Sourced entirely from Walla Walla's Les Collines Vineyard, this lovely Syrah features pretty strawberry and cherry flavors that are broadly displayed with a rich vein of chocolate. It's forward and flavorful, drinking quite nicely already, but with the stuffing to cellar for a few more years.
This Cabernet Sauvignon-based Bordeaux-style blend is very rich and ripe in blackberries, cherries and currants. It has smooth tannins, and the finish is dry. It's a fashionable wine that feels plush in the mouth, but young. Give it 3–4 years, but it doesn't seem to have the stuffing for the long haul.
We've been watching this wine for several years and it doesn't seem to be on the upswing. This vintage is good as Cabernet goes, but it comes across a little racy and jumpy. The mouthfeel runs tight and the tannins are spunky and on the border of being rough. Maybe another year will settle it down.
Red berry and intense white pepper aromas lead the nose on this bright, easygoing red. The fresh, easy-drinking palate offers wild cherry, clove and toasted almond alongside loose knit tannins. Serve chilled for an ideal summer red.
The purity of the nose is glacial and utterly clean-cut. There is an enticing headiness to the lemon and bergamot aromas. This is uncompromisingly citric, with a life force that can revive every single nerve in our body. The citrus spectrum gets its full due in a wine that sparkles and glistens with purity and life itself.
Leather, lemon peel, licorice and black currant aromas set up a flush, rich palate with choppy tannins, depth and volume. Flavors of blackberry come with notes of licorice, spice, prune, herbs and pepper, while the finish is big, grabby and loamy in feel, with dark, herbal flavors.
While light in body, this lemony spätlese has a textural broadness. Its sweet tangerine and quince flavors are neatly offset by a streak of bright acidity and lingering earth notes. Drink now through 2022.
Classic aromas of freshly mown grass, hay, lemon, lime and wet stone mark this Sauvignon Blanc. It's savory in acidity, feeling fresh, racy and a touch spritzy on the mouth. Tasted in March, it was a little spritzy, but that should be gone by the time you read this review.
A blend of Sangiovese and 10% other grapes, this opens with aromas of toast, red berries and underbrush. The straightforward palate doles out sugary black plum, dark cherries and chocolate lightly accented with black pepper.
A field blend of the Enclos vineyard has given a superrich wine, densely packed with juicy black plum fruits and sweet tannins. Ripe, full-bodied with a slight alcohol burn.
This is made in a plump, cheerful style, combining simple, jammy cherry fruit with ample vanilla. It's a well-made wine, but one that comes across as somewhat lacking in dimension. For an entry-level Pinot Noir, perhaps that's all one can expect.
This sophisticated and stylish Pinot Noir from the south of France was made a Burgundy producer. It has fine tannins, juicy red cherry-driven acidity and a warm, ripe aftertaste.
There's a prominent herbal streak to the nose of this wine, but it's not jarring thanks to the support of rich black cherry and black currant fruit core. The savory herbs, menthol and licorice herbaceousness continue through to the palate, where again it's matched by equally intense dark fruit flavors and a mouthwatering finish. Silky wood-spice accents the long finish. Drink now–2014.
Shows the crisp acidity that usually marks Carneros Chards, and also an earthy, freshly picked herb quality to the jammy peach, pineapple and green apple flavors. Consider it a food-worthy Chardonnay. Drink now.
Luscious golden in color, this dessert wine shows aromas of honeyed and seared lemons, with hints of marigold and toasted sunflower seeds. The palate is rich and sweet, but balanced expertly with a great tartness.
Aged in acacia and French oak barrels, this shows notes of lemon, smoke, and slightly burnt toast. It's creamy in feel but doesn't entirely come together.
Most of the local grapes seem to have been blended into this smooth wine. It is soft, generous and fruity with ripe tannins contrasting with the stalky black fruits. The wine should age another few months, so drink from 2018.

Ripe fruit with soft acidity chracterize this wine that has great concentration, jammy flavors, strawberry jelly and a generous plum skin texture.
After an early blast of mint and menthol, the nose works its way toward solid berry, spice and vanilla flavors. The finish is round and moderately long, with no sharp angles or jagged edges. Good yet standard Merlot at a welcome price point.
This is intense for Garnacha, with piercing berry, spice and heat to the bouquet. This is a big, burly type of modern Garnacha, with a streak of boosting acidity. Flavors of plum, berry and cherry finish long and slightly raisiny. Big and bruising but still well balanced.
A briary, open-knit Zinfandel with hints of strawberries on the vanilla-scented nose. Juicy and berry-filled on the palate, with ample varietal character, accentuated by zesty acidity on the finish. Drink now–2010.
Chenin Blanc has found an unlikely new home in Cahors, to judge by the producers who are trying it out. It works well, giving a deliciously nutty character as well as intense citrus and minerality. Age this wine until 2015.
Named for a common snake, this is a pleasant commercial Shiraz, marrying blackberry fruit with plenty of vanilla from American oak. Then it adds spice and meaty notes to give it enough complexity to hang at the dinner table, finishing with crisp acidity.
Composed, mossy aromas of fern, black fruits and cedar are more subtle than the palate, which is intense and a bit grating. Dark flavors of chocolate, wild berry and mocha finish with depth, integrated tannins and chocolaty richness. Drink this blend of three vineyards through 2021.
An interesting wine. It comes from a southerly part of Napa Valley many consider too cool for fine Cab. But this was a warm vintage. The result is very ripe fruit, wrapped in robust, hard tannins that make the wine too young to drink now. The blackberry, currant, cherry and new oak flavors are delicious, but this Cab needs at least through 2008 to come into its own, and will be better after 2010.
Pressed acacia flower, Spanish broom and yellow stone fruit aromas come together on this sunny wine. The bright palate offers nectarine zest, green apple and Vernaccia's typical accents of bitter almond. Brisk acidity gives it a lively character.
Easy and fresh, you could pair this Italian white with freshwater fish or grilled shrimp. It delivers one-dimensional tones of citrus, peach and melon.
This single-vineyard Barolo shows ripe berry aromas and whiffs of incense and espresso. The palate shows almost overripe cherry fruit, layered with herbs, coffee and underbrush notes. It has big but ripe tannins and is fast approaching optimum drinkability. Enjoy it over the next few years.
Dense, lush aromas of coffee, blackberry and turned earth give way to notes aged Gouda cheese. The jammy palate is packed with a mix of blackberry, plum and cassis flavors that blend together. A compact, grapy finish shows no hard edges, gaps or breaks. Drink through 2022.
This Cabernet Franc is an intense, penetrating wine with thick aromas of black fruit and exotic spice that form a compact, powerful whole. It's a bit tough on the palate where its bruising density leaves it mark.
Cola spice dominates the nose of this thick, concentrated wine from the heart of Westside Road. Stemmy earth notes accompany its ripe red fruit, as toasted oak and vanilla flavors extend long into the finish.
86-88 Barrel sample. Firmly tannic and rather jammy at the same time, a wine that shows a rustic edge, but does retain the juiciness of the year.
With a rare if tiny showing for the Blaufränkisch grape (3%), which this estate grows on their Los Olives property, this is a tangy, tart and lean Syrah, with bright cherry fruit, coffee, light menthol, tobacco and cedar on the nose. Aromatic wood flavors of pipe smoke and cigar box show on the palate, along with red cherry fruit, vanilla and sagebrush elements.
Offering deep complexity, this bold, brazen wine is decadent in caramel and toffee aromas and flavors, with a foundation of ripe Gravenstein apple and hazelnuts. The oak is pronounced but it adds more than it subtracts. Cellar through 2018.
This sparkling wine from Israel's hilly north has complex yeasty aromas and a bready, toasty palate with citrus accents. The mouthfeel is full, and the long dry finish features mild grapefruit and spice notes.
Named after the Sardinian word for “plow,” S'arai is a blend of Cannonau, Carignano and Bovale (vinified separately and aged in oak) that offers a full palate of exotic spice and mature fruit. It boasts excellent concentration and soft, drying tannins.
The better (by just a whisker) of Huber's 2011 Pinot Noirs, the Bienenberg is distinctly fragrant of cherry blossoms and rose. Tart red cherry and cranberry flavors are streaked with saltwater and stone, finishing on a lingering mineral tone. It's bold, yet elegantly structured.
A blend of five diverse red grapes, this lightly fruity quaffer is almost invisible as far as flavor is concerned. It hits the tongue and vanishes.
This totally fresh wine has benefited from the quality of whites in 2007 Bordeaux. It is lemony with pink grapefruit flavors giving an intense lift. There is some herbaceousness, with green herbs and juicy fruits. To drink now.
A neutral cava with white candy and mango on the nose. The palate is both foamy and scouring, with soda cracker, apple and citrus pith creating the flavor profile and finish. Shows basic flavors, normal mouthfeel and scouring acidity.
The texture on this Pinot is a little rustic, but the fruit is ripe in strawberries and raspberries. And the price, the lowest of Loring's many 2012 Pinot Noirs, makes it a relative bargain. Drink up.
Smoky, toasty oak forms an obvious part of this full-bodied wine's personality, from the first whiff to the spicy, cedary flavors and on to the finish. Moderate tannins add texture.
This wine is tight, crisp with citrus flavors and intense acidity. It is developing into a refreshing, broader wine that will convey a riper character. Just wait until late 2017.
Herbal and somewhat harsh in tannin, this wine is plummy and forceful, blended with smaller amounts of Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc and Merlot. It has a bitterness to the finish that's a mix of cedar, currant and leather.
This brightly acidic, clean wine doesn't appear to have any oak influence. What you get are pure, ripe orange, Meyer lemon, lime and peach flavors that finish honeyed, yet dry. It's an easy wine to drink with many foods.

Squeezed lime, wet concrete and green apple rind scents show on the nose of this basic bottling. Kaffir lime tang meets with ripe red apple and pear notes on the palate, framed by a stony texture.
Leather and a mild green funkiness surround spicy berry and cherry aromas. This feels rather heavy and lacking in agility. Grapey flavors of baked berry fruits are overweight on a savory-tasting finish.
Here's an unexpected surprise from Southern Italy available at an excellent price. This is a deeply concentrated and succulent wine that delivers deep notes of milk chocolate, spice, mature berry and blackberry preserves. The wine is noticeably sweet and ends with a blast of jammy fruit.
This 2007 version of the Cat's Meow is 41% Merlot, 41% Syrah and 18% Cabernet—much softer and simpler than the 2006 version. It's a fine, all-purpose blend mixing strawberry and cherry fruit with some more earthy, herbal flavors. It leans a bit too much to the herbal side, bringing in hints of bell pepper and green tea, but it's solidly crafted and well-suited to heartier winter meals.
Ripe blackberry notes dominate this wine's nose and palate. Their ripe, tart juiciness makes for an appetizing, fruit-driven palate. Smooth but pervaded by freshness, it's a vibrant, juicy blend full of refreshing, ripe fruit. Uncomplicated but delicious.

Tasting rich and vital, this has a wealth of raspberry, cherry and cola flavors to the long, spicy finish. It's just what you want Pinot Noir to be: dry, silky and elegant. It doesn't seem to be an ager, so drink by 2014.
This rich expression of Nerello Mascalese (a grape native to Sicily's Mount Etna) offers thick density and extraction followed by fresh notes of berry fruit and spice. It ends with chewy tannins and bright cherry flavors.
Should be either sweeter or drier. It straddles the line, offering coffee and cassis flavors and astringent tannins.
Cooked plums, ripe strawberries, cola and a bit of clove make for an interesting nose on this bottling from a reliable and widely accessible producer. The palate shows slate, rust and pencil shavings as well as nutmeg and sour cranberries.
This is a fine representation of the high-quality, fruit-laden 2012 vintage. Forward and ripe, it's packed with cherry fruit that shows a bit of candy at its center, then rolls into a lingering finish with hints of spice and caramel.
The fragrance of black cherries and violet lay the groundwork for flavors of cherry, Fuji apple, eucalyptus, violet and a touch of iodine.

From the Treviso area of Prosecco, this luminous sparkler offers steely effervescence and sharp aromas of white flower and dried grass. There's also a touch of bitter almond on the crisp finish.
This wine opens with aromas that recall mature black cherry, toast, vanilla, subtle oak, coffee and chocolate that carry through to the palate alongside bracing tannins. The fruity richness doesn't quite stand up to the oak influence.
Dark, full-bodied and a little ponderous, showing firm tannins and blackberry, blueberry, plum, mocha and spice flavors that finish dry and spicy. Lacks some complexity, but overall a good red to wash down grilled meats.

This offers a good structure as well as ripe fruit. Touches of wood with black cherries and red plums giving a cushioned feel. The wine has weight, plenty of ripe fruits and a good tannic, almost austere end. It needs to age; drink from 2018.
A soft, oaky style, with lots of barrel-char and burnt-sugar aromas backed by lemon and grapefruit. Toasted marshmallow and sautéed pineapple flavors finish gently.

An enormously rich wine, flamboyant in blackberries, cherries, Dr. Pepper cola, sweet cured meat, anise and black pepper flavors that sink in deep and last long into the finish. An unusual blend of Malbec, Merlot and Syrah, it's powerful in tannins and bone dry. Grill up your best steak and enjoy.
Judged as medium-sweet on the international scale, this shows petrol and lime Jell-o on the nose. The palate is not overly sweet but certainly not dry, offering honeyed lemon curds and sugared lime-peel flavors.
An impressive wine for $8. This smells savory, like a mix of smoked meats, roasted berries and leather, and it feels juicy and racy, with a good texture and honest flavors of blackberry, savory meat and spice. The finishes is mild, with mild herbal notes and tobacco.
Delicate crushed mineral and lemon aromas turn riper and fruitier on the palate. While not deeply complex, its plush, pristine white peach and tangerine flavors are lip smacking. It's zippy acidity and clean, mineral finish lend refreshment.
Plump red cherry and red cranberry meet with touches of anise, sagebrush, cola and purple flowers on the nose of this smartly priced bottling. Strawberry candy, smashed herbs and more anise show once sipped, framed by lots of acidity.
Sharp feline and citrus aromas announce an edgy, citric palate. This Moscatel has a lot of Sauvignon character throughout, including flavors of lime, scallion and green herbs. An oily, pithy finish makes for a harsh ending.
Jewell threads the needle where so many others fail with this dry, elegant Sauvignon Blanc. Does exactly what it should, providing a mouthwateringly crisp white wine that scours and cleanses the palate. The flavors are of limes, lemons, grapefruits, wildflowers and stony, tangy minerals. Really a brilliant wine, among the best of its class.
Though two years older than the widely available Oregon bottling from Firesteed, this wine is almost its twin. Elegant and balanced, with light flavors of wild berry and an herbal underpinning.
Light structure and perfumes come from the blending of Syrah with Muscat. It's an intriguing wine, providing spice as well as fresh fruits and acidity. Crisp and fruity at the end.
A solid effort, this Shiraz-Viognier blend offers up raspberry and strawberry scents punctuated by more pungent notes of road tar, licorice, cola and black olive. It's full-bodied, powered by its 15% alcohol, yet could use a richer, thicker texture. Drink now to 2011.
Zesty and fragrant with notes of grapefruit and citrus blossom, this is an endlessly quaffable white with wide appeal. Juicy and fresh with a focused edge of acidity, it finishes briskly with just a touch of minerality.
Big and sultry as always, with bacon, smoke, black fruit and a full rack of spices making for a wonderful bouquet. Concentrated and ripped for a 2007, with blackberry, clove, pepper, cinnamon and vanilla flavors. And then comes tobacco and more spice on the finish, which is grabby but understandable because it's so young. Best from 2012 through 2019.
The ??? Pinot from Ayoub is a true mystery wine, made with fruit sourced from unnameable but exceptionally high-end sources. Flavors are subtle and elegant, with lovely floral top notes over firm, well-balanced fruit and chewy tannins. Still quite young and compact, this wine needs another five years at a minimum to blossom. Drink 2020–2030.
A very ripe, oaky Chardonnay made in a popular style to appeal to fans of richness. Swamps the palate with pineapple tart, pear marmalade, crème brûlée, vanilla and cinnamon spice flavors, balanced with crisp acidity.
This tangy, light-bodied wine wakes up the nose with a vivid herb and citrus aroma, and livens up the palate with fresh lemon and green-apple flavors. The texture melts slightly around the edges to keep it smooth on the finish.
Scents of wild berry, fragrant blue flower, tilled soil, new leather and a whiff of Mediterranean herb lead the nose on this fantastic wine. Rich layers of juicy black cherry, fleshy raspberry, cinnamon, licorice and mint weave throughout the palate while firm but refined tannins provide structure. Drink 2019–2029.
Pleasant and fruity to sip, soft in texture, light- to medium bodied, it has a rich yellow-gold color, butter-candy aromas, ripe apple flavors and a slightly sweet finish.
A lesson in contrasts: the nose is both weedy and sweet, with green strawberry aromas mixing with caramel. The palate is also green and slightly bitter, but that's offset by some jammy berry sweetness. Medium in terms of weight, but with burdensome sugars and a clumsy finish.
Here's a soft, creamy Prosecco Extra Dry (the blend contains 10% Chardonnay for smoothness) with delicate floral harmony backed by sweet fruit tones and golden honey. The wine offers a lively, no-fuss approach that would pair well with afternoon snacks.
This opens with a familiar taste of artificial, roasted char, then it moves on to soupy berry aromas. It feels scratchy, with flavors of hickory, baked plum and berry.
Comes out of the chute showing a funky, rubbery edge, but that blows off with a little time to reveal dark, somewhat earthy notes of cola and blackberry. It's medium-bodied, with good length to the finish, where it picks up enough dusty tannins to give it backbone.
Reserve is rarely a word found in front of rosé, but here it seems meaningful. The 82% Merlot and 18% Grenache complement each other nicely. Cherry-pie tartness with a bit of sweet blueberry flavor make for a full-bodied, round and bone dry rosé that's substantial and delicious.
Fans of high-octane Zins will love this one from Dry Creek Valley. It's as soft and as sweet as a dessert wine in raspberry tart, baked brown sugar and cinnamon spice flavors, yet is balanced with good tannins.
Light in color but lively in its aromas of lettuce, half-sour pickle, fresh asparagus and passion fruit. The palate is zesty and jumpy, with lemon-lime flavors, passion fruit and a touch of minerality. And the finish is quite long for Sauvignon, a direct reflection of the wine's heft and 14.5% alcohol.
Pineapple fruit rings out loud and clear, with a slightly grainy, though not sweet, entrance. A blocky but powerfully fruity Riesling, with overtones of orange peel and black tea.
This caramel-flavored wine has a light red fruit character. It is off dry and needs to be severely chilled.
Petruccino is a delightful and elegant wine with great red fruit intensity folded within leather, spice and tobacco. The blend is Sangiovese (60%), Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon and the wine offers crispness, softness and structure, respectively, thanks to these three varieties.
Here's a clean Pinot Grigio in a screwcap bottle with pristine aromas of citrus, pear and peach blossom. The wine is tonic and lean in the mouth with fresh zest on the close and a crisp, easygoing finish.
Earthy berry aromas come with a note of balsam wood, tobacco and soy sauce. This is juicy, with sinewy tannins and a sense of perpetual hardness to the palate. Lightly herbal blackberry and plum flavors exhibit a stalky note. Toasty and tannic on the finish. Drink through 2022.
Classic Lodi Cab, from a vintage that wasn't too hot or too cool. The wine is soft and lush, with milk chocolate and cassis flavors and the vanillins and sweet char of oak. Easy and delicious, it's a wine to drink now.
There's a funky herbal, slightly green quality to this wine, possessed of plenty acidity, as the variety is known for, yet muted in its typical floral aromatics and bright fruit.
This dark, brooding wine shows many of the qualities of this great vineyard, just across the road from Romanée-Conti. The dense tannins dominate, but the rich black cherry fruit is their equal, creating structure. A wine to savor over many years.
This is an older vintage of ripasso and it shows in the wine's garnet color and its evolved aromas of resin, licorice, candied cherry and cola. In the mouth, it is linear and smooth with textured, slightly gritty tannins. Imported by Vinarium Inc.
This is a very sweet-smelling frizzante with intense aromas of peach, exotic fruit and kiwi. The mouthfeel is lean and somewhat watery but the wine cleans the palate thanks to its natural crispness.
Lush, ripe and a touch heady, this is a rich selection that's brimming with notes of white peach, quince, melon and red apple. Thankfully, hints of ginger, nectarine pit and citrus rind add lift to the palate and remain through the medium-length finish.
Sweet cedar, cinnamon and plum aromas are followed by plush and pretty flavors of black cherry, raspberry and plum. The wine offers a good acid balance and a spicy, bright finish. This should pair well with tomato-based dishes and lamb.
On the plus side, this is a well-ripened, full-bodied wine, with a mix of pear and citrus. It's lightly spicy and drinking at its peak, broad and just a little flat on the palate.
This “white label” blend is broad and lush, and it offers typical Bordeaux-blend aromas and flavors of plum, cassis and cigar box. A mocha note comes through on the softly tannic finish. Drink now and over the next few years.
Distinctly Californian in style, this is a soft, big, fruity Pinot Noir, packed with cherry, berry, cola and spice flavors that sink deep into the palate and last long on the finish. It's certainly rich, but lacks some finesse and elegance. Drink now.
Don't be fooled by the easy fruitiness of this delicious wine, because underneath the blackberry flavors is a powerfully tannic structure. Opulent and dense, it promises considerable aging. Drink this complex wine from 2018.
Inky black in color, this Petite Sirah is rather thin in flavor. It has diluted blackberry jam fruit, compromised by vegetal notes.
Classic Napa mountain Cab, intensely concentrated in fruit, richly tannic, and dry, and of course, such a wine needs and deserves the new oak they lavished on it. Flavors and structure perfectly balance, with massive cherry pie, cassis and mocha flavors meshing with sweetly ripe tannins and rich barrel notes of vanilla and char. This is a dramatic, complex young Cab that will hold for six years.
Thick and masculine this has savory aromas of pipe tobacco, candied fruit, leather, cola and tar. There's soft succulence in the mouth thanks to the ripeness of the fruit, but the solid tannins still need time to soften. Drink after 2018.
Juicy raspberry, plum, cherry and vanilla aromas give this red blend a mouthwatering start. On the palate, wooded spice, currants and pepper flavors are clean and spicy. Approachable and versatile.
This widely available bottling by the Niven family is a very safe and reliable expression of Cab, with black plums, crushed slate, a touch of oak, some purple flowers and a little soy on the nose. The palate is also down the middle, with earth, wood and dark fruit all present, framed by strong acidity and firm but not overwhelming tannins.
Here's a pristine and crystalline Pinot Grigio with fresh tones of almond skin, orange zest, lemon drop and white mineral. The wine is sharp and slightly tart in the mouth and those zesty qualities would work well with vegetables au gratin or fried mozzarella sticks.
Tastes like cherry-pie filling that got a little caramelized in the oven, giving it a Rhône-type note. Maybe charred oak contributes to the smoky heaviness. Either way, it's a distraction from the delicate, sensual silkiness we all want from Pinot Noir.
Made entirely from Tempranillo—a rarity in Italy—this opens with aromas of blue flowers, plum and a whiff of leather. The smooth palate delivers dried cherry and prune, accented by ground pepper and oak-driven spices. Bracing but fine-grained tannins and fresh acidity provide support. Drink through 2018.
Smelling of coconut on the nose, this Malbec is good, like a big mouthful of cherry pie.
This is a full-flavored Pinot Noir, brimming with cherry, cola, red licorice and earthier notes of sautéed wild mushrooms and spices. It's quite low in alcohol, which preserves the airy, silky texture you want in a nice Pinot. It's also a young wine. Give it six years in the cellar.
This wine is at just the right moment of maturity. It's on the dry side, but with just a touch of rich honey flavor. It is ripe, full in the mouth, finely perfumed and ready to drink now.
Spice, vanilla and oak abound in this barrel-aged Chardonnay, but it's a neatly balanced wine with crisp-tart apple and pear flavors. Brisk acidity off sets a palate that's rich and substantial in texture.
Restrained notes of woodsmoke play around hints of ripe yellow pear. The palate boasts a backbone of acidity plus that famous varietal phenolic grip. Made for the long run, the wine will turn out rich and layered. Drink from 2016.
A portion of this estate is in the cru appellation of La Londe, based on schist soil. This single-vineyard wine is impressive in its ripe fruit and vein of fresh acidity. It is full bodied and concentrated, while keeping a light touch. It is dry, lightly structured and likely will be even better from the end of 2016.
This garnet-colored Bulgarian Cabernet Sauvignon has aromas of black cherry and wet river rock. In the mouth, there are flavors of black plum, black cherry and a touch of graphite before the smooth tannic finish.
This serious wine is still very young. Its black fruits and firm tannins are showing considerable potential, with acidity and a firm core still developing. This will be a powerful wine and one that needs to age. Drink from 2016.
Sourced entirely from the Rose Rock Vineyard in Oregon's Eola-Amity Hills, this is fresh and carries plenty of strawberry fruit alongside cola and a whiff of smoke. The mouthfeel is textural, light and layered, with a pretty, medium-long finish.
Amity's dry Gewürztraminer is one of Oregon's finest, and a major strength of the winery. In this new vintage it shows broad and rich flavors, that run the spectrum from floral and spicy to sweetly honeyed. It's dry, make no mistake, but carries an impression of fruit sweetness. The deepening gold color suggests some early oxidation, and the caramel and toasted grain flavors are already at their peak.
Dense and structured, this opens with aromas of baked plum, menthol, coconut and toasted oak. The concentrated palate displays cherries marinated in spirits, grilled sage, licorice and roasted coffee bean alongside tightly packed, fine-grained tannins that need time to unwind. Drink 2018–2030.
Exuberantly floral, with notes of honeysuckle and orange blossom, yet not at all cloying or perfumy, this sparkler showcases all the delicacy and verve you expect from a Mosel Riesling. Softly effervescent, it's dry and spry on the palate, with an exceptionally long, peach-tinged finish.
Another successful Marinus from this small Monterey County appellation. Made from all five classic Bordeaux varieties, it's dry and rich in blackberries, black currants, crème de cassis and cedar, and is more rough in tannins than your typical Napa Cabernet blend. Drink now–2013.
Fresh gooseberry, lemon and apple skin dominate the nose here, carrying over to the medium-weight palate. Although the acid seems a bit apart from the rest of the wine, this Barossa Riesling is pleasantly crisp, with nice spice and candied apple notes. Drink now to 2012.
This blend of two native Turkish grapes is deep red-violet in color, with a bouquet of blackberry, blueberry and anisette. It is fairly tart from entry to finish, with soft tannins and flavors of raspberry, strawberry and lingonberry that dominate over touches of espresso bean and leather.
Tight at first, with aromas of olive, brick dust, cured cheese and dark fruit. The palate on this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Carmenère (15%) is narrow but healthy. There's a tough juiciness to it, and eventually it reveals black plum and cherry flavors along with a chocolaty finish that holds its pose until the cameras are off.
A little bitter and raw, with irregular tannins and a green edge of mint to the cherries and blackberries. Drink this country-style wine with simple fare.
Plump and slightly sweet, this late-harvest Riesling comes in at 10% alcohol—something along the lines of a rich spätlese in terms of its alcohol-acid-sugar balance. Notes of pineapple and crushed stone open up to melon fruit on the palate and finish long, with a bit of cinnamon or ginger spice.
This is the most approachable of Roessler's '07 Pinots, and if you're looking for something to drink now, it offers the most pleasure. Balanced and crisp, it has a lightly silky texture, with a good depth of cherries, raspberries, licorice, bacon, smoky vanilla and sandalwood. Just lovely.
You have to consider the vintage to understand this Pinot, which comes from prime, southern valley terroir. It was very hot, the earliest harvest ever, and it was difficult for vintners to achieve total balance. The '04 Ted's Vineyard is certainly forward in cherries, cola, spice and chocolate, and it has a nice, silky mouthfeel. But it lacks the acidic crispness that makes for balance. Drink now.
Vermentino is one of the latest hits from a long list of successful Italian white wines. Crisp, clean and definitely marked by a green or herbal note, the wine feels zesty and sharp on the palate. A dusting of crushed white pepper makes for a very nice endnote.
Shows real elegance and finesse in a variety that can sometimes get a little out of control. With smoothly polished tannins giving it a full-bodied mouthfeel, this single-vineyard wine has rich blackberry, black currant and pepper flavors. Fine now, and should develop for many years.
As proof that any blend goes in Tejo, this wine is 50-50 Touriga Nacional and Pinot Noir. Initially, it is more full of acidity than fruit, although it does have a soft texture. The fruit comes through slowly to give fresh plum and berry flavors at the end. Drink now.
A gold-colored wine, intensely sweet and with intense acidity. The combination gives a wine that is lemon and honey in a glass. There is a liquorous feel to the smooth texture. And it is still very young. Drink after 2017.
Not much in the way of aromas except for flatness and apple juice. This wine is a cipher for the most part; it has flat apple and lemon flavors and then a maderized finish that is wheaty and suggests vanilla. Not fully vital; could already be past its prime.
Crisp green apple, lime and vanilla wafer mingle on the palate of this 100% Chardonnay, méthode champenoise sparkler from the Bazzano Vineyard. It drips with minerality, lively and tangy with a medium to light body that picks up depth and breadth on the finish.
Very fresh and crisp, with yeasty aromas and delicious red currant flavors. The acidity is well integrated with the red fruits, giving crispness as well as a light, delicate character. The aftertaste shows some more sweetness, but the wine balances well.
A winemaking history in a bottle, this Georgian wine made from Rkatsiteli grapes is an unusual peek into techniques tracing back 8,000 years. Deep gold in color due to an extended maceration on grape skins, this wine was aged in buried clay vessels, then oak, giving it a smoky, earthy profile with notes of butterscotch and roasted nut skins. There's not a lot of acidity, but it's refreshing with pretty orange peel notes and a grape tannin astringency on the finish.
Behind the main vineyards of the Côte de Beaune, this village makes some delicious wines, both red and white. This village wine, full of fruit, also has wood-aging flavors and firm spicy tannins. It is coming together well and will be ready to drink from 2020.

This wine is flashy and there's no denying that, starting with a heady nose of toast, smoke and orange peel. The palate is viscous and grainy on notes of mint and ginger, with barely enough acidity to maintain balance. Nonetheless, it is inherently appealing.
This is a supersmooth, easy-going wine with mild dark-fruit flavors, very little tannin and a soft texture. Two years aging in previously used oak barrels helped round off any corners in the mouthfeel.
Aromas of this wine show considerable wood. On the palate, the wood is very present, giving acidity as well as layers of toast and spice. Hints of yellow fruit show through, suggesting the possibility of a ripe, rich wine in the future. Drink from 2019.
Fresh and vibrant, showing berry-cherry cola, tea, clove, vanilla and smoky flavors that are just delicious. The wine is accented by youthful acidity. If you like your Pinots young, this is for you. However, it should knit together and improve with some cellaring. Best 2007–2010.
This is an attractive and fruity, creamy wine. Flavors of ripe apples and pear juice are boosted by the nutty suggestion of bottle age and by a tight, crisp acidity at the end.
Sumptuous aromas of raspberry preserves and violets perfume this exceptionally lifted, pretty Pinot Noir. A deep core of fresh cherry and strawberry flavors penetrates the palate marked by complexities of tea leaf and potpourri, along with a firm frame of tannins.

Aromas of almond skins, pyrazines and spent white fruits struggle to draw you in. This vintage was wet and cool in Galicia, with frost issues, and this shows it. The palate is round but oily in feel, while flavors of saline water, pithy citrus and bitter melon finish peppery and soft, with low acidity.
Cherry cola accents this bright pretty wine. Fruit flavors emphasize fresh raspberries, backed with tangy acidity and modest tannins. Drink now through 2022.

A yellow straw shade, with a somewhat beery, sulphury scent. It's better in the mouth, where it's spicy and yeasty. But the beery quality persists right through the finish. It leaves a slightly sour flavor long after being swallowed, like a bite of sourdough bread.
Nicely structured, with citrus fruits (lemon, lime, pink grapefruit) displayed against stiffer flavors of skin. There is a hint of residual sugar, and the alcohol is just under 13%, but the overall impression is a dry, tight style with little or no floral character.
This rich Syrah leaves little to the imagination. It's dramatic in blackberry and cherry fruit and exotic spices, sweetened with new oak. Delicious now and for the next few years.
Underbrush, tobacco and spiced plum aromas lead the nose. On the straightforward palate, notes of anise and clove add depth to the black cherry core. It's easy drinking, with lithe tannins.
Quite tart for a grape that usually is not known for its acidity, this sharp, spicy Syrah is loaded with concentrated cranberry and raspberry fruit. It would be a fine companion to roasted poultry, or pork with some sort of red fruit sauce.
The aromas are almost completely closed up at present, occasionally revealing notes of barrel spice, dried cherries, herb and dark fruit. The palate displays a sense of elegance and nuance, showing pleasing subtleties. Give it some time in the cellar to for the wood to integrate and the fruit to blossom. Best after 2023.
This is one of the drier, more structured Merlots from any Napa appellation in recent memory. Far from being a soft, gooey fruit bomb, its marked by big-time tannins, with herb, leather, olive tapenade, cherry and dark unsweetened chocolate flavors. It might strike fruit fans as austere, but true aficionados will recognize a great mountain wine of enormous complexity.
This wine is rich, with great fruitiness and a good sense of structure. It has weight, with plenty of full yellow and fresh pear flavors cut by intense acidity. Well balanced, rich and dense, it will age although it can be drunk from the end of 2015.
A crush of mineral notes on the nose lend earthy dimension to this buoyantly ripe, fruity auslese.

Ready to drink now but it will shine for decades to come.

While it lacks its usual complexity, it's juicy, delicious and extremely accessible. Drink 2015–2019.
With succulent cherry, red currant, herb and oak flavors, this is a tasty Cabernet. It's softly tannic and dry, with some real complexity. It might develop bottle complexity over the next six years.
This very quaffable blend of 75% Cabernet Sauvignon, 13% Syrah and 12% Grenache hails from a property in northeast Paso. Juicy strawberry, black plum and cherry meet with wet soil and chopped mint on the nose. These make for a fresh landing on the palate as well, where red berries mesh with anise and sweet clove notes. Soft tannins and bright acid hold it together.
The first 2007 reds from Spain are now appearing, and it seems like talk of a tough vintage are being confirmed. This wine is sheer and miserly. The nose is gaseous, while the flavors of blackberry and spice are seared by sharp, overt acidity. Shrill and not nearly as generous as the '06.

It's flush and thorough in feel, with dark plum, berry and spice flavors. A warm finish with spicy oak and cocoa notes is smooth and attractive; drink through 2020.

The acidity really brings this Chard together, adding a racy edge to buttered toast, popcorn and orange marmalade flavors. Straightforward, but a good example of the modern California style.
Dark violet in color, with plenty of wood smoke and earth to the nose, which also offers tobacco and mushroom. Dynamic on the palate, with ripe cherry and blackberry flavors.

Some richness and smoky flavors, although the acidity is also very present. Flavors of red cherry and pepper are balanced by a core of tannins.
Has very strong aromas of peaches and baked apples. Tastes like apple juice and oak.
The Loin de l'Oeil is the local white grape of Gaillac and is very happy to produce sweet botrytized wines. This is rich, full of botrytis flavors along with fig, sultana and apricot. Age the wine for 2–3 years, but it is ready to drink now.
A dusty, well-integrated Merlot from one of Wente's estate properties, with plum, licorice and vanilla most prominent on the palate and a touch of Italian spice, given the little bit of Barbera and Sangiovese (also Petit Verdot) mixed in.
A bit hot in alcohol, and glycerine gives a sugary-sweet edge to the blackberries, black cherries and oak. There might even be some residual sugar. If you like your reds soft and on the sweet side, and lots of people do, it's for you.
A blend of Merlot (56%) and Cabernet Franc, this wine opens with aromas of flowers, huckleberry, cardamom and green herbs, along with light barrel accents. The flavors are dense and rich but far from over the top, supported by chewy tannins and a fruit-filled finish that sails into the distance. Best after 2020.
The name is spot-on for a wine with a pink-pearl color. It is gently fruity with soft red fruits and a touch of pepper. The aftertaste is crisp, clean and refreshing.
Sourced entirely from the Otis Harlan Vineyard, these vines were planted about 25 years ago. It's a pleasure to see them singled out for this showcase bottling.

This has a shy nose, offering subtle whiffs of white stone fruit and spring wildflower while the simple palate offers orchard fruit, citrus zest and bitter almond flavors. It's fresh, with zesty acidity.

The virtues of this 100% Chardonnay are its elegance, cleanliness, brightness and the sheer pleasure it offers. It's so refined and complex, offering flavors of Meyer lemons, Kaffir limes, brioche and smoky vanilla that change endlessly in the glass. Just fabulous, and a terrifically versatile food wine.
On the dry side, this has plenty of fruit for an aged tawny, although it does actually taste older than its 10-years indication. That gives it a good depth of flavor as well as wood acidity that shines through at the end.
Subtle aromas of yellow peach, golden apple and honeydew melon lead off. However the palate is rather lean, with citrus and mineral notes alongside bracing acidity but not much fruit richness.
Here's a soft, sweet, jammy wine to drink with barbecue and rich meat stews. It's rich in tannins, with somewhat sweet blackberry, cherry, mocha and spice flavors.
Made entirely with native grape Arneis, this refreshing white has pretty aromas of white spring flowers and pear. The palate offers creamy apple, pear and mineral notes along with crisp acidity that give it a clean finish.
The wine shows the rich wood flavors with the same intensity as the red fruits. It is firm and somewhat extracted with licorice and dark chocolate coming through the cherry fruits. At the end, the solid wood is dominant, meaning the wine needs time. Drink from 2017.
A wonderful Pinot, whose dryness and relative austerity hides great power and complexity. Shows exquisite flavors of raspberries, strawberries, cherries and blackberries, with a floral note of violets and deeper suggestions of forest floor, beef and peppery spices. Wonderful now with decanting, and should develop through 2013.
The best Still Waters release right now, this presents a sophisticated nose of cherry chutney, black pepper, blueberry and burning sagebrush. On the palate, blueberry fruit gets dashed with more black sage and tobacco, and the acidity and tannins are just right.
Luigi Baudana enjoys a long history with the Cerretta cru and that experience has led to extraordinary results. This is one of the darkest Barolos we saw in 2004 and its thick concentration is offset by soft nuances of black cherry, vanilla, espresso and smoky overtones. It has thick, tart tasting tannins and offers loads of Indian spice on the finish.
Here's a big, tannic Cabernet, stuffed with black currants, olives and cassis, with a lot of sweet oak. It's bone dry and elegant, and while it's not a cellar candidate, it does show fine character for drinking now.
Portal's vineyards high above the Douro Valley produce wines that are fresh and poised. This is structured while also fruity wine is firm with tannins and ripe with blackberry fruits. It has acidity, spice from wood aging and a dry aftertaste. The wine can be drunk soon, from late 2016.
This is a composed and lovely wine, light in body yet quite complex. The palate is integrated with flavors of ripe apple, lemon, melon and beeswax. Structured with a mere suggestion of oak, it'll stand up to bigger foods than most California Chenin, textured and good-naturedly creamy.
Here's a dark, rich, somewhat heavy Pinot Noir, of the type sometimes referred to as Rhône-like. It lacks vibrancy, but is very rich in red cherry pie filling, cola, oatmeal cookie, cocoa, vanilla and smoky meringue flavors. Drink now.
This vintage of Madre features pretty aromas, inspired by fruit and flower-based elements. The wine boasts a deep ruby color and full concentration in the mouth. The finish is long and satisfying.

There's an exuberance of succulent black cherry and raspberry within this medium-bodied to lighter-style of wine. It offers a stronger presence of fruit and spicy clove and cinnamon on the palate than on the nose. Leathery, firm tannins provide support without distraction.
Old vine (1967 planting) Sauvignon Blanc from Oregon? OK, this is a rarity. The wine has a gentle grace, and manages to convey layering and complexity within a fairly light frame. Moderate acidity, some yeasty texture, and a mix of apple and citrus fruit all come together in a clean, fresh, well-balanced effort.
There's a lot of oak on this wine, or maybe the wood just dominates because the fruit is so thin. Either way, it's clean, lean and dry.
Jammy, concentrated aromas of boysenberry, violet petal and oak spice are about as rich and lusty as Rioja gets. This wine from a warm vintage is lush and lusty but less structured than other vintages. Jammy blackberry and blueberry flavors end in a jammy fashion. Drink through 2020.
Lovely, ripe Pinot Gris, smooth and rich. The acidity is creamy-crisp, giving point to the plum, spice and apricot flavors. Delicious, fresh, unoaked wine.
Aged in American oak, this blend of Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot offers a straightforward enjoyment of blackberry, tar and tobacco leaf with a side of bacon. Thick and bittersweet in tannin, it's an affordable red that will please many palates.
This wine's fat, tropical fruit, banana and toast nose has a pungent, spicy Gewürztraminer quality. The palate is the payoff. It shows the aforementioned elements, plus cinnamon, clove and vanilla flavors. What you get is a ripe, unctuous wine—big, maybe even a bit overblown, but totally lovable. The long, spicy finish of this unique bottling is impressive.
An immediately attractive wine with intense aromas of black raspberry, cherry and plum laced with toasted cedar and mocha accents. The texture is like crushed velvet, and the rich mouth filled with firm but fine-grain tannins. A touch of cola spice unwinds on the long finish. Drink now–2014.
Keuka Spring Vineyards staged a remarkable renewal recently by introducing August Deimel, increasingly one of the Finger Lakes most promising young winemakers, as its head winemaker.

It's deeply concentrated with black fruit flavors, yet elegant and refined, finishing long on a flurry of feathery tannins.
A blend of Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier, this is a rich, slightly sweet bubbly. It has ripe, delicious flavors of raspberry jam, cherry pie, vanilla, yeasty sourdough and buttercream. It's a little rough in texture, but a nice wine for drinking now.
A good, rugged Zin for washing down burgers and ribs. It's rich in fruit, soft and lusty, with big tannins framing cherry, berry, cocoa and spice flavors.

Coming from one of the state's top Syrah sites, this wine brings aromas of dark fruit, iron and coffee. The fruit flavors are sweet and well proportioned, pulling up toward the finish.

A very fruity Zinfandel, rewarding in blackberry, blueberry tart and currant flavors, accented with dark chocolate, anise and pepper. Too soft, and would benefit from greater crispness, but it's a nice Zin now.
This reserve-level wine, from the estate vineyard, is certified biodynamic. Smooth and sweetly spicy, it compounds raspberry pastry with hints of crumb cake and brown sugar. The finish seems to hit a bit of a wall, and resonates with a touch of metal.
Full and very rich, this is an opulent style of wine. It has a ripe, tropical fruit feel to it, offering power as well as fresh acidity. Pineapples and lychees give fruitiness, perfume and spice. The aftertaste, with its liquorous character, is gloriously warm and concentated. Drink from 2018.
You don't have to age this wine—Jarvis did it for you, holding it back more than five years before release, which is a very expensive proposition for a winery. It's a splendid Cabernet, with the tannins soft and velvety. The blackberry and black currant fruit flavors are as fresh and vibrant as the day the wine was bottled, an early indication of its ageability. This wonderful wine is so good, you can drink it now, but it will continue to evolve in the bottle for many years.
This wine has the richness of 2009, while still is mineral, taut and textured. The yellow fruits are balanced by intense acidity and a ripe, full-bodied feel. The wine is complex, needing aging; the aftertaste intense, crisp and fruity.
Nice price for such a tasty wine, and it's the kind that's making PG the hottest white in America. It's dryish and brightly crisp in acids, with polished citrus, fig, peach, green apple and white pepper flavors.
With a small percentage of whole-cluster fermentation, this tight, cranberry-infused Pinot offers bright layers of cherry and citrus that are savory and well-adjusted in acidity. Softly textured it's a good one to enjoy with pork tenderloin adorned in dried cherries.
At the age of 5 1/2 years, this Cabernet is still very forward and sweet in blackberry, cherry, anise and cedar flavors. The tannins are rich and thick, in the way of mountain grapes. The wine tastes a bit one-dimensional, although it could be going through an awkward phase.
Sanguine and restrained, this is a lovely version of the variety from the region. It is high-toned in refreshing acidity and accented in red cherry and a memorable spiciness of cinnamon and pepper. Completely understated, it will do well at the table or on its own as aperitif fare.
Yeast still swings on the nose of this young, fresh Riesling. The palate, however, gives glimpses of what is yet to come: lovely notes of mandarin and plump citrus with lots of verve.
A big, full-bodied Cabernet, dry and smooth in tannins, with blackberry, blueberry and oak flavors. There's an earthiness that grounds this wine, making it less flamboyant than a Napa Cab, but food friendly and easy to drink.
Wood aged and ripe, this is a structured wine that is full of fruit and still young. It has bright cherry flavors that have been softened and smoothed out by the wood aging. There is also a mineral edge to the fruitiness. It will be a rich wine but it needs more time. Drink from 2019.
Light aromas of flower, apple, melon and pear lead to dry stone-fruit flavors. It's a pleasant if somewhat innocuous easy drinker.
Spicy and substantial, this authoritative Riesling snaps into tight focus around apple and melon flavors. Hints of clove and ginger add complexity.
Composed of 100% Falanghina, this wine disappoints. The fruit is primarily pear with a resinous component. The palate weight is sufficient, but the acid is too high.
A 50-case release from Six Sigma, this Sauvignon Blanc is fleshy, dark and complex, complete with lime, lemon and guava tones. It'll stand up to creamy shellfish dishes or a platter of fresh oysters—an intense study in barrel-kissed Lake County Sauvignon Blanc.
This is a finely balanced, rich wine. Bringing together Antão Vaz, Arinto and Roupeiro, the wine is packed with white fruits and a citrus twist. It has a crisp edge and bright acidity although with an underlying richness that makes the wine ideal for spicy foods. Drink now.
Heady florals, honey and smoke mix languorously on the nose of this deeply concentrated, multifaceted dry Riesling from Fox Run. The palate is sultry with smoke and orange rinds, a dark minerality and lime acidity.
Sweet and lithe, this is a wonderfully clean and pure expression of Riesling eiswein. There's no botrytis, only sweet pineapple, apple and citrus flavors that finish on lingering notes of orange and lemon. This should last a while in the cellar, but there's really no reason to delay gratification.
This opens with scents of green melon rind, strawberry hull and lime that carry through to the palate alongside an additional note of peach. A pleasant grassy tone gives interest to the finish, while ample acidity keeps the palate fresh and clean. Drink now.
A blend of Viognier, Roussanne, Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Grigio, this unoaked wine has complex citrus fruit, vanilla bean, wildflower and spice flavors, brightened by a brisk scour of acidity. It's actually better than many Lodi whites made from the individual varieties, showing the importance of the art of blending.
A nice Cabernet, proper and pleasant, it tastes of blackcurrants and oak and is very dry and balanced. No doubting that it comes from a good vineyard and has been made in a competent style.
A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this opulent wine opens with aromas of black currant, graphite and baking spice. The juicy concentrated palate delivers black cherry, blackberry, tobacco and licorice framed in bold polished tannins. Drink now through 2023.
Fresh and young, this offers scents of violets, plummy fruit and a wash of root beer. Lively in the mouth, it has a leesy minerality that underscores rather light, pretty, but simple fruit. Drink up while it retains its freshness.
An aroma like honeydew melon and rich flavors like pear juice and bananas make this full-bodied wine extremely fruity without being openly sweet. It has light color, soothing texture and lingering finish.
On the drier side of aged tawnys, this is a wine with wood, dried raisin and noticeable spirit. It has reviving acidity from the wood, just showing rich sweetness on the finish.
More sharp and tight than in previous vintages, with orange peel, cherry and dried spices. Shows condensed, limited berry flavors, while the finish moves toward dark fruit and raisin. A bit rubbery and tannic, but still a good wine. In its defense, '02 was not a stellar year.
It's amazing how this super-concentrated wine smells like chocolate cherries and tastes almost like blackberry syrup, yet it's nice and dry in style. A firm coating of fine tannins gives grip on the tongue and seems to extend the juicy fruit and dark chocolate notes on the finish.
Intriguing aromas of graphite, damp campfire, roasted meat and dried black cherries make for a savory nose to this bottling from a vineyard in the Corralitos area. Roasted cherries and plums show on the palate, where interesting notes of tar, charcoal and pencil shavings arise. Vanilla and sandalwood show at the finish.
This lush wine, green/gold in hue, offers mouth-coating flavors with richness and style. Apple, pear and papaya fruit holds down the center, with elements of toasted hazelnuts and butter pecan from aging in 20% new French oak. The creamy, smooth finish is delightful.
Aromas of cured meat, camphor, cherry marinated in spirits, toast and a whiff of smoke lead the nose. The smoky note carries over to the brawny, monolithic palate along with ripe raspberry, dried herb and a hint of saline. Tightly wound tannins leave a bracing finish.
A good Zinfandel, rich and spicy in wild berry, tobacco, anise and sweet cedar flavors that are just a little sweet in alcohol. Easy to drink with barbecue, or try Vietnamese or Mexican beef dishes.
This wine packs a big wallop of superripe flavors, so it doesn't taste as petite as its name. Aromas like raisins and rhubarb lead to deep, overripe fruit flavors recalling prunes and dried cherries. An overall feeling of full body persists, but without much tannin to support it.
As a young wine, this is bold, dark, crusty and slightly out of joint. There are salty, balsamic flavors along with muscular berry notes, and then butter and other barrel-driven flavors on the finish. It's chunky bordering on huge, with balance and integration issues. Maybe a little better in six months.
Aromas of lemon chiffon, white flowers, lychee and lime are forward and attractive. A zesty, citric feel accompanies refreshing tangerine, nectarine and lime flavors. Tangy and edgy on the finish, this blend of Muscat and Chardonnay is snappy from front to back.
This is a big, rich Pinot Noir, showing the ripeness of the vintage. It's delicious in primary fruit flavors and oak, but too thick and immature to drink now. With its flamboyant raspberries, cherries, licorice, bacon and smoky sandalwood, it should evolve into quite an interesting wine after 2011, if you can keep your hands off it.
Honeyed but otherwise not overly aromatic, this full-bodied, corpulent Condrieu still provides enjoyable drinking. The weighty notes of honeyed citrus linger on the finish, but drink up over the next six months or so.
Scratchy plum and spice aromas are entirely typical for coastal Chile. This wine feels racy and a bit high in acidity, while flavors of orange peel, pie cherry, red plum and mild oak end with juicy length and an indication that this is a quality wine, especially by Chilean Pinot Noir standards.
Luscious pink grapefruit and a hint of raspberry seduce on the palate of this bright, fruity Riesling. It's pleasantly sweet but calibrated neatly by a shot of lemon-lime acidity on the midpalate. A straightforward, spry sip for everyday enjoyment.
Pomatia is an almost mythical creation—like one of those half man, half beast monsters from ancient times. The blend is not that unusual, but the results might be likened to a sculpture by Picasso—a piece of wood here, an old newspaper there, and a bicycle seat for a head. Not to disparage the wine—it's flavorful and full-bodied, but a puzzler. Funkadelic meets Clapton? Cherries and earth, tannin and tea.
Big, bold and very fruity, this is a black-currant-dominated wine. It's full of broad brush strokes of acidity and spice from wood aging. Still young, it needs to be aged. Drink from 2016.
Subdued dried herb, vanilla and dill aromas mix with notes of baking spice. The red-fruit flavors are light and elegant, winnowing toward the finish.
Honeyed ripe pear fruit fills the nose. The palate amplifies this rich notion even more with a generous touch of residual sweetness that bathes the pear fruit in caramel richness. There is a glint of pleasant phenolic bitterness here and there but the pear fruit conquers all. This is rich but fresh with a medium-sweet finish ideal for blue cheese.
This is an attractive, herbal wine. It has light spice and touches of cilantro as well as crisp red fruits. The wine is bright and ready to drink.
A little soft and lacking in structure, but otherwise a beautiful Zinfandel, filled with alluring flavors, and entirely dry. Offers waves of ripe blackberry and cherry tart, licorice, cola, currant and Asian spices that finish long and fruity.

Bob Betz calls this his first-ever “reserve style” wine from Bordeaux varieties. It started with a single barrel of Red Willow Cabernet Franc and evolved into this six-barrel blend. Le Parrain opens with whiffs of smoke, gun metal and rock weaving through the dense red fruits. Pipe tobacco and licorice flavors come into play from the barrel aging.

Swirls of rich, ripe yellow peach and orange penetrate the palate of this finely textured spätlese. It's thrilling and zesty yet lusciously juicy, finishing long with a slatey, mineral tang.

Electric purple in color, it conveys wiry aromas of wet dog, green herbs and berry fruits. The palate is loud and clacky, with a jumpy overall feel and an overriding sense of youth.

For such a deep-colored wine, it's the lighter red fruits and minerality that comprise the aromas in this GSM with Petite Sirah.

Deliciously ripe in raspberries, cherries and plums, with an exotic coating of sweetly caramelized oak. The texture is fine and silky, but ultimately the wine is too sweet and simple.
Ochoa usually puts out a good rosado made from Garnacha, and this vintage keeps the winery's reputation intact. It starts with fresh peachy aromas and then comes on with light berry and peach flavors. Arguably a bit candied, but perfectly good for summer quaffing.
90 Villa Selvapiana 2000 Vigneto Bucerchiale Riserva (Chianti Rufina); $31. Lots of mature complexity on display here.

Earthy and minerally, an austere Chard by today's standards, with a thyme and tobacco edge to the modest peach fruit. My bias is for either impossibly rich, oaky Chards or sleek, fruity, unoaked ones. This falls between those goal posts.
Dark on the nose, with olive, rubber, plum and black cherry scents. The mouth is deep and saturated; there's fairly lush plum, coffee and mocha flavors to ponder. Shows some espresso-like bitterness on the back end, which adds to the complexity. A definite contender. Imported by Megawine Inc.
Here's a rich, full-bodied and somewhat heavy wine fresh out of the bottle. Made from different vineyards throughout the appellation, it shows a certain generic Pinot Noir quality, albeit at a high level. The cherry flavors have an edge of heirloom tomato.
This 2009 shows the varietal's fantastic wealth of exotic tropical fruits, flowers, honey and spices. But it's also vibrant in acidity, with a core of cold minerality.
There are ripe yellow fruits here in this generous, full wine. Touches of spice add to the general feeling of richness. There is enough concentration to give a wine that is dense and with a pepper aftertaste.
A first whiff suggests rather dank scents of moist, subterranean earth. In the mouth it turns candied, like a cherry soda. The two components do not seem to fit together, and the acids linger through a chalky finish.

Made from the Dijon clone called 777, this wine is pretty on the nose, floral in black pepper and clove, a solid, softly textured effort from two vineyards, Leras and Pleasant Hill. Forested in pine, dried herb and cola, it closes out in round waves of juicy acidity.
The color is more brown than would be expected at this age, but flavors are still young, albeit candied. Red cherry and root beer aromas lead to sweet, tart cherry flavors.
Overly perfumed, with burnt notes, wayward sulfur and acridness at the wine's core. The palate is fleshy and low in acidity, with bitterness to the white fruit flavors that are none too clean. Offers very little that's redeeming.
Somewhat heavy and overripe, with plum and earth aromas. The palate carries a heavy, weighty feel, with rather murky flavors. Rubbery tannins create a stick-to-the-cheeks sensation. Seems like the winemaking effort was here but maybe not the grapes.

This wine takes you on a trip to an outer wine world where deep, cushioned berry aromas come with exotic perfumes, bath oils and crushed flower petals. It's ultrasaturated and jammy, but not clunky or heavy. This tastes like a storm of blackberry, espresso and Swiss chocolate, while black spices and length bring up the rear.

This wine—aged in a mixture of 20% new American and French oak—shows a pleasing interplay of fruit and barrel. Notes of vanilla and cocoa intermingle with dried herbs, cranberry and bell pepper. It brings focused, lightly styled but high-octane cranberry flavors that are almost creamy in feel, with the focus more on elegance than sheer power.
The estate wine from this Cahors showpiece property, it shows the rich intensity that can be conjured from Malbec, packed with tannins but also with dark, ripe-berry fruit and great intensity. It is a wine with potential—with a tannic structure that will see the wine starting to drink from 2020.
Charm marks this young Pinot Noir. It's softly luscious and delicious in raspberry and cherry jam, cola and sandalwood flavors. The acid-tannin structure is just fine. It shows a candied directness now, but you may want to cellar it for 5–6 years and see how it develops.
Here's a lively rosé from Tuscany (a 50-50 blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon) that offers pretty aromas of cranberry, red rose and white almond. Pair it with smoked salmon and capers.
Lightly herbal and slightly earthy aromas meet fresh, ripe berry flavors in this medium-bodied wine. It's smooth and soft in texture, low in tannins, and easy to enjoy.

A sizable 70,000 cases of this bargain were imported, so it should be reasonably available. The citrus fruit does have a greenish tinge to it, boasting hints of passion fruit, snap pea and green onion, but they're within the bounds of regional typicity, and bring a crisp, tart edge to the finish. Drink now.

Aromatic with black olive, herb and cocoa wrapped around tight raspberry/cassis fruit. The fruit is nicely concentrated, then splays into a broad, chocolaty, softly tannic midpalate. At this stage of life the wine remains angular, woody and unintegrated; with another six to twelve months in bottle it could improve its score by a point or two.
A beautifully rounded wine, textured white fruits and fresh acidity well integrated into a rich structure. Hints of wood underline the yellow fruits and crisp, citrus, final acidity.
Blackberry, licorice and leather on the nose lead to a tannic, firm palate with stretched dark plum and black cherry flavors. There's vibrancy and juiciness to the wine, with a firm finish that introduces chocolate. Highly regular, with nothing glaring or wrong.
This is an impressive bottling with complex caramel, toasted nut and tropical fruit aromas. It's big bodied and coats the mouth with rich butterscotch, banana, apple and toasty oak flavors. A touch short on acid, it could use bit more backbone, but it's still big on toasty style. Its long, satisfying finish is an oak lover's paradise.
Aromas of dark berry, cooking spice, chopped herb and a whiff of violet lead the nose. The racy palate offers sour cherry, cranberry, espresso and sage alongside brisk acidity and close-grained tannins. A hint of clove closes the finish.

Light peach, apricot and buttercup aromas are better at first but lose steam with airing.

Aromas of coffee, mocha, spice and dark fruit lead to full-bodied, layered fruit and barrel flavors. There's plenty of power but it doesn't sacrifice nuance.
This nonvintage wine comes packaged in 187ml cans (four to a pack)—each good for one generous glass pour. Pleasant cherry flavors carry it through, and it's a fine porch pounder, or safe on a hike or campout (just pack the cans back out). Maybe the packaging puts the thought of metal in a taster's head, but there seems to be a slightly tinny aftertaste.
What does “briary” mean? Think about a wild black raspberry bush on a hot summer afternoon. The wood, the bark, the dust, the chlorophyll from the baking leaves and the berries, with that wild, primitive, spicy, fructose-sweet bitterness. This wine is bone dry and finishes with a tannic bite. Drink it now with sturdy chow.
Powdery bath-soap aromas are odd on the nose. The mealy palate boasts flavors of bitter melon and papaya.
This is a dark, fairly tannic Pinot, with flavors of blue and black stone fruits and berries, and neutral oak. It's acidic and very dry. Not showing much finesse, but a good wine.
Keller's Grosses Gewächs offerings are hard to come by, even in Germany, but the von der Fels offers GG quality fruit at a markedly gentle price.

It's stunning already, but sure to gain power and density from 2020 on.
Hay stack, honey and rich apricot and peach aromas lead to a thick, unctuous palate that's basically viscous as syrup. But wow does it taste good; it's deep and delicious, with honeyed fruit, brown sugar and maple notes to go with lush stonefruit essence. Pour atop vanilla ice cream for an amazing dessert.
This white from the Franken region of Germany shows more aromatic intensity than your typical Silvaner, but there's a candied edge here that's a bit offputting. It's crisp in the mouth, with good body and some nice apple notes that linger. Drink now.
A firm, classic upstanding wine, with dry, firm fruit tannins that support generous ripe fruit. Aromas of violets and toasty wood are followed on the palate with flavors of herbs and dark chocolate. The finish is concentrated, firmly dry with a good backbone of rich fruit. Age for at least 10 years before drinking.
The wine suffers from heavy extraction that has left wood rather than fruit. Somewhere in there, the black-currant fruit and acidity are struggling. It will soften, although that wood will remain a problem.
Not too many Port-style wines are made from Chardonnay, as this one is. The residual sugar is 6%, but it's not a very good wine. Tastes cooked or stewed in pineapple, and the high alcohol makes for a burnt feeling.
This smooth and rich wine has spiced apple, white peach and pink grapefruit flavors, all mixed into a serious package. It's a wine worth aging to bring the beautiful fruit right to the fore. Screwcap.
This textured, perfumed wine has citrus and apple fruits that are dominated by strong perfumes as well as fresh acidity. It needs until late 2014 to age.
Anisette, steeped plum, tar and espresso aromas take shape in the glass. The concentrated palate offers fleshy wild cherry, dark berry, graphite, coffee and allspice alongside chewy tannins.

Sourced from several vineyards within the AVA, this shows lightly peppery Bing cherries with streaks of sassafras, cola and dark chocolate. The wine gains amplitude and weight as it breathes open. The finish brings flavors of cherry pie and a hint of butter.

A pleasant blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Semillon, this wine from the Grassa family in Gascony, south-west France, is in an easy-drinking style. There are soft flavors of almonds, green plums, nice light poised fruit.
Here's a youthful but oak-driven blend that offers a patina of toasted almond and spice over a plush core of ripe raspberry and blackberry. The finish is characterized by tobacco and drying mineral.
This is not a very good Chardonnay. It's thin and simple, with syrupy flavors and a heavy hand of oak.
A rounded, creamy style of wine but with a deliciously fresh green fruit and citrus character. It shows very pure, direct flavors, a line that goes right through the wine. There is only a hint of spice or toast at the mouthwateringly fresh finish.
Sweet, rooty and robust, with a firm palate that hits with cassis, blackberry and mild herbal flavors. A juicy, lively, well-balanced Cab with earthy fig notes and chocolate on the finish. Nothing complicated; just plain old proper and drinkable.

This has aromas of citrus blossom and lemon pith. There are flavors of green apple and pear in the mouth with an acidic finish.
This wine is fruity, fresh with a underlying tannic character. The fruit and the dryness combine to produce a wine that is firm while rich, showing juicy Merlot and some medium-term potential. Drink from 2017.
This southern Rhône-style blend is very soft and as sweet as a fruit pastry. It has jammy or pie-filling flavors of cherries, raspberries, red plums and cocoa, with a dusting of pepper and cinnamon.
Feels a bit common, with one-dimensional flavors of cherries, Dr. Pepper and oak. Yet it's clean and silky and brisk and dry, and is a satisfactory Pinot Noir. Just needs more stuffing and complexity to earn a higher score.
New leather, pressed rose, violet, baking spice and crushed herb are just some of the aromas you'll find in this textbook Barolo. Firm yet loaded with finesse, the palate offers red cherry, strawberry compote, cinnamon and clove notes set against a backdrop of youthfully austere tannins and bright acidity. A licorice note lingers on the finish. Give it time to fully bloom. Drink 2023–2033.
Cecchetti Wine Company makes a lot of Line 39 Sauvignon Blanc, but does it well, offering an affordable wine that tastes great. Grassy and tropical, it's true to Lake County, with just a touch of New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc character. Crisp and easy to drink.
San Polo's Rosso di Montalcino offers classic aromas of cherry, black fruit and spice. But it also adds an extra layer of vanilla and sweet spice that makes for a very nice ensemble. It's smooth, rich and spicy on the close.
Made with 90% Corvina and 10% Sangiovese, this opens with subtle aromas of black currant and forest floor. The medium-bodied palate offers ripe black cherry and nutmeg alongside smooth tannins. Enjoy soon.

An herbaceous, youthful wine that can be drunk immediately for its fresh, crisp fruits. It's light and bright.
A great wine that combines the modern, ultraripe winemaking style with Rutherford's fine, complex tannins and herbs. Feels plush and velvety in the mouth, exploding in blackberry, cherry, cassis and chocolate flavors grounded with sweet sage. An ager. Beautiful now through 2012, at least.
This modest Pinot offers light strawberry fruit, a dash of cola, and a component of earth and stem that overtakes the finish. It hints at green tannins, with a bit of brown sugar sweetness, perhaps from aging in 30% new oak.
A herbal touch of crushed lemon balm and apple peel makes for an intriguing, inviting nose. The palate adds fresh apple notes to these subtle herb notes and remains totally juicy and lively. This seems far fresher than its six years and the herbal tinges are just the beginning of maturity. This is lovely, concentrated and spirited stuff with a whistle-clean utterly dry finish. Testaments to Riesling's longevity.
This is a ripe and fruity wine that's deliciously fresh and fragrant. It has a lively, creamy texture with apple juice flavors and a touch of nuttiness.

The aromas are earthy, rich in moist soil. The palate is just as rich, a full, opulent wine powered with yellow fruits and a light touch of spice.
Marked by crisp acidity and very ripe flavors of cherry pie filling, red currants, cocoa and cola, with a grilled smokiness throughout. Elegant and silky, if a bit direct. Give it a year or two to mellow.

Soft perfume susbsumes citrus, apple and peach. All three are referenced in equal measure on the dry, clean palate. This has a soft aspect but is nonetheless fresh, taut, concentrated and linear. It comes with huge charm and clarity and finishes with pure, zesty dryness and pure, pervasive and lasting apple notes. Still young, oozing potential. Drink 2017–2030.
A strongly wood-aged wine, firm, spicy and with a burnt edge. Chocolate and black plum-skin fruit combine in this strongly tannic wine. There is, though, a smooth element from the ripe Merlot in the blend, giving potential richness in 2–3 years.
Aromas of jasmine and citrus blossom lead the nose. The soft, bright palate offers yellow peach, Bartlett pear and a hint of candied lemon rind. A note of white almond closes the finish.
Part of the same family business as Philippe Girard's wines (Benoît is his brother), this is a ripe, pure and clean wine. Perfumed acidity and zesty flavors are integrated into the rich green fruit. Apples and green plums dominate this refreshing wine that will develop. Drink from 2017.
Tough and gritty for a Merlot, with sweet and sour cherry and blackberry flavors wrapped into stringy tannins. With its briary, peppery finish, it could almost be a Zinfandel.
Here's a rosato from Tuscany that is vibrant and clean and richly redolent of forest fruit, red berry, dried sage and minerals. In fact, the herbal quality is unique and impressive. It's clean and fresh in the mouth with medium persistency.

A little tart and pickled off the bat, with notes of rhubarb and red cherry along with a stronger, more evident blast of oak. The palate is fresh but sort of lean and wanting, with regular raspberry and plum flavors. Snappy but slightly sappy and resiny for what's on offer.
Bright and savory, this wine opens with heady scents of white spring flower and yellow stone fruit. The light and refreshing palate offers white peach and lemon zest alongside crisp acidity.
This is ripe and dense, with great tannins; opulent, rich black fruit; and a fresh, juicy aftertaste. The structure and the solid texture both point to long-term aging.
This garnet-colored Ruen smells like fresh cherry juice, pomegranate, and pencil lead, not to mention a pleasant whiff of petrol. It is soft on entry, tasting of black cherry and pomegranate with chewy tannins.
Great price for a Zin of this purity and varietal truth. Dry and medium-bodied, but sweet in fruit, it shows wonderful flavors of wild forest blackberries, with complications from black pepper, orange peel, anise and Asian spices. The texture is sheer velvet. Best now and through 2010.
A Blanc de Noir made in a traditional method from half Chardonnay and half Pinot Noir grapes, this is peach colored, dry and frothy in sandalwood and savory raspberry fruit.

This Maipo estate is now aligned with Chateau Ste. Michelle of Washington, which doesn't exactly impact this nice everyday Cabernet. Bramble and fresh berry aromas offer an entry, then there's chewy raspberry on the palate along with a grace of vanilla and some warmth. A bone-warming wine for fall and winter.
Builds complexity through skillful layering of ripe black cherries, fresh greens (ferns or parsley stems), leather and earth. The mouthfeel is spot-on, rich and plush without seeming heavy. Tart cherry and dusty cocoa notes on the finish and a fine sense of balance make it drinkable now or in several years.
A little green, with mint flavors accompanying the modest blackberries and cherries. The wine is 100% varietal. Shows promise, but needs greater concentration, even if the price has to be higher.
This is a full-bodied Pinot, packed with ripe cherry and strawberry flavors and framed in spicy nuance. A shade hot on the finish, ending with an unusually bright licorice and herbal edge.
Although labeled Verdelho, this medium- to full-bodied wine contains a noticeable 14% Sauvignon Blanc. As a result, there's a slightly sweaty, pungent aspect to its aroma, and the almost sweet, peachy notes are balanced by tart, grapefruity ones. Drink now.
Big and burly, with a semi- syrupy nose that brings berry jam, molasses, shoe polish and crusty, baked berry aromas. But don't dismiss this Cab as overripe and over the top; it is complete and balanced, with good acidity pushing black fruit, chocolate, clove and herb flavors to their maximum expression. And it dials it in on the finish, where cola and coffee notes are just right. Drink now through 2010.
Stalky, mulchy aromas of compost and underripe fruit are a low point on this otherwise decent high-end Rioja from a poor vintage. Hard and grating across the palate, this tastes stalky, burnt and raw, with oak for cover.
This unique red sparkler from Piedmont offers cherry and earth aromas before turning lighter on the palate, with slightly sweet strawberry flavors and a soft mousse.  Aunique wine, the finish has nice length and appealingly full fruit flavors that have appeal even to serious wine drinkers.
This wine is a dark garnet color, dense to the rim, with potent blackberry and dark cherry aromas. Delicious and pure blackberry and boysenberry flavors linger through the finish. It's big and bold but the power is in the magnificent fruit flavors rather than tannin, oak or alcohol.
Aromas of forest floor, new leather, cherries marinated in spirits, crushed violet and menthol open on the nose. On the warm, one-dimensional palate, tightly wound tannins frame ripe black cherry and baking spice. Give the tannins a few years to unwind then drink.

Fresh and simple, this lean white has subdued flavors suggesting yellow apple and citrus while bright acidity gives it a crisp if short finish. Pour at informal gatherings or drink as a breezy aperitivo.

Pale and refined, with elegant flavors of raspberries, strawberries, vanilla and yeasty lees. With a slightly sweet finish, balanced with crisp coastal acidity, it's a beautiful sparkling wine.
A creamy, honeyed wine, with tropical fruit sweetness and spiciness. It has a custardy, lemon-tinged flavor and texture, and a rich, spicy aftertaste. There's something baroque about its layers and myriad flavors.

A blend of three vineyards, all estate, this is a sublime, viscous and somewhat briny wine that exhibits some oak on the nose. With a balance of weight and creaminess, it starts in ginger and nutmeg spiciness on the nose, building on the palate into fresh-cut apple and pear.
An extremely dark wine, with purple bubbles, this blend of 94% Syrah, 4% Grenache and 2% Roussanne expresses the essence of dark, extracted fruit all around. The nose shows blackberry puree, fresh lilacs, lava rocks and background pepper and vanilla. The palate is rich with espresso bean, violets, lavender and dried blueberries, lifted by minty herbs and peppery spice.
Enormously rich, a powerhouse Syrah packed with ripe red and black currant, cassis, blueberry, chocolate, coffee, cedar and spice flavors. The structure earns the wine extra points, with ultra-refined tannins and crisp acidity. Decadent, and at its best now, in its flashy youth.
Super-fruity, a blast of pineapple jam, ripe peach tart, honeysuckle, vanilla custard and tingly spice flavors. So rich, it's hard to believe there's no oak.
Candied, jammy aromas don't lead to much of anything. Grating, sour, weak stuff; tomato and bland plum flavors with sour acidity. Barely worth a splash.
A barrel-fermented wine, this is richly perfumed both from the wood and from the nature of the Cercial grape. The wine has strong minerality, lime and lemon flavors, and layers of spice. Already mature, the wine is ready to drink.
Truly a unique Shiraz, with its smoky, leathery and black olive aromas, followed by flavors of black cherry and spice. While appealing overall, it has a slightly syrupy, raisiny quality and some roughness on the palate that distracts slightly from the flavors. This is not really a problem for fans of wines that push the envelope a bit.
A Pinot Noir Port is a rare creature, and somewhat contradictory. How to match the delicacy of the Pinot Noir grape with the power and punch of Port-style, fortified wines? Here it's the alcohol and spirits that take over; the Pinot bringing some cherry fruit flavors but lacking the weight and substance to feel authoritative.
Made by Il Poggiolo's Rodolfo Cosimi, this wine is loaded with vanilla, floral intensity, berry fruit, cigar box, anise seed, roasted espresso and an unexpected twist of orange peel. Firm tannins with cinnamon, clove and a smoky finish. Ripe, full and immediately drinkable. Imported by Enotec Imports, Inc.

Structured, tight and mineral, this wine comes from a selection of old vines in a northwest-facing vineyard on the Rimauresq estate. It offers a tang, along with a firm structure and concentration. A fruitier aftertaste will show through more strongly by late 2016.
It's dry, full bodied and tannic, needing some time to come around. A note of black pepper is immediately noticeable on first whiff. On the palate, it's rich and deep, with in blackberry and blueberry flavors, with an umami tang—like bacon. Give it until 2014 or so, although it's not a longterm ager.
Beautiful. With crisp, tart coastal acidity, it offers lush waves of black cherries, anise, Asian spices and smoky vanilla, in a silky, elegant mouthfeel. Great value for the quality.
This is a pleasing blend of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, with tiny additions of Malbec and Syrah. It has a toasty flavor like coffee cake—think breakfast pastries, dusted with a mix of cinnamon and brown sugar. Toss in a cup of espresso and a splash of cassis, and you have a handle on the wine.
A bit disappointing on the nose; pickle barrel and onion are supported by moderate spice. This is a dark, extracted wine with dusty tannins and a lean feel. Cherry/berry fruit flavors are shy as they compete with tomato, spice and onion before finishing metallic.
Muscular tannins nearly mask raspberry and cherry notes in this structured red. The juicy palate leads to a fairly long, earthy finish. Drink with pepperoni and sausage pizza.
There is definite structure to this wine, with its tight acidity and dry, apple skin and pear flavors. There is also a touch of spice that gives the wine a unique twist. Drink now.
A wine that shows a new, improved direction for this chateau, neighbor of Château d'Yquem. It is impressively concentrated and full of dry botrytis, orange marmalade and sweet pear juice flavors.
This is a muscular, concentrated wine with no shortage of horsepower. In the mouth, it's rather loud and acidic. But flavors of smoky black fruits, vanilla and toast are good and finish spicy. This is heavy and rough by global standards, but it has good fruit and isn't timid.
Tart and juicy, this Cabernet/Merlot/Syrah blend matches cranberry and plum fruit flavors to milk chocolate and nougat highlights. Well-crafted, with a pleasing florality (to coin a word) in the finish. An outstanding value.
This is an attractive blend of grapes from different regions of Portugal. It is light, with crisp acidity and refreshing lemon fruit. The wine is soft and ready to drink.
Firm and condensed, but with the potential to unfold over the next three years.

Fold in toast and spice on the finish and you have a serious Cabernet Sauvignon that defines good value.
Dark, big, rich, extracted, dry, powerful. So what else did you expect? This is true Pet, with blueberry, blackberry, chocolate and pepper flavors and voluminous tannins. Drink now with barbecue.
From grapes grown in the high altitude Castel Ringberg vineyard, Elena Walch delivers a vibrant, balanced wine that shows structure and finesse. It's loaded with sensations of Granny Smith apple, lemon zest, banana peel and an underlying mineral note that carries to the crisp finish.
For a superripe and full-bodied wine this also has good, firm tannins to beef up the texture and balance all the sweet ripe berry and cherry flavors. There are touches of clove and anise in the aroma, and a cocoa-like flavor on the finish.
Perfumed new-wood aromas give this wine a toasty start. On the palate, the fruit is evident, showing luscious red-plum and black currant flavors. There are attractive notes of toast and pepper as the wine smoothes out on the palate.
Spicy and bright, this could almost be Grenache, with its penetrating acid and the lightness to its fruit. The oak flavors—substantial hits of cracker, vanilla and chocolate—seem rather heavy-handed at this point. On the plus side, the nice spicy fruit carries on admirably into the finish.
A lovely touch of orange zest teases the nose and there also is a lovely hint of chervil. The streamlined palate comes in with bundled citrus notes. The tart flesh of tangerine and the zest of lemon are softened and enriched with orange oil and ample concentration. This is pure and racy, linear and bold. There is something salty and energetic, something incredibly fresh and vibrant at the core. The palate and finish are absolutely dry, the echo is long and clean. Blastingly fresh right now, sure to evolve. Drink 2019–2037.
Typically this is a five-grape Bordeaux blend, weighted heavily towards the Cabernet Sauvignon (70%). The different grape flavors are nicely entwined, with a distinctive tobacco and vanilla streak. Big, chewy, juicy and still young, this is quite astringent. It seems as if it will need more years of bottle age to pull together.
Wines like this helped Colchagua earn its Wine Region of the Year award for 2005. For not much cash you get a ripe, smoky Cabernet with black plum and cassis aromas as well as flavors of raspberry and cherry. Balanced and pure, with some vanilla and oak on the finish. Imported by Pasternak Wine Imports.
In this pale rosé, freshly cut orange and papaya mousse aromas are cut with a bit of flintiness. The wine plays to the citrus side of the pink scale, with lemon rind and pink grapefruit flavors. It's a bit more watery than other rosés of the vintage.
A finely perfumed wine, with powerful tannins but also excellent flavors of dark plums and ripe black fruits, with well-judged acidity and a sweet jelly character. This will develop relatively quickly for a Cornas, but still has all the right power and intensity.
Blue flower, woodland berry, cake spice, menthol and a whisper of vineyard dust come together on the nose while the smooth, juicy, palate doles out ripe red cherry, crushed strawberry, star anise and cinnamon. It's a lovely wine, with polished, enveloping tannins and fresh acidity that provide an elegant, accessible structure.
Sweet oak notes of almond, vanilla and honey edge over a portion of the fresh fruit. They also provide a modern approach that will go down well with the international palate. At the same time, the wine has background notes of blue flowers and delicate perfumes that remind you of the beautiful Tuscan territory.
With an edge of sweet red currants and slightly sugared herb tea, this Zin can't really be called completely dry. But the tannin-acid balance is very fine, and makes the wine balanced and enjoyable. Should be great with pasta with a marinara sauce.
Scents of Spanish broom, acacia flower, beeswax and orchard fruit lead the nose on this slightly sweet sparkler. The bright, creamy palate doles out juicy white peach, yellow apple and ripe pear while firm acidity and a vibrant mousse offer support. A hint of almond closes the finish.
Intense tangerine notes are flecked with hints of powdered sugar, dried herbs and potpourri on this pleasant off-dry Riesling. It's easy drinking with lush, slightly overripe fruit, but finishes quite dry with a steely, honeyed feel.
Tough and gritty, with fruit-flavored power bar flavors of cherries, chocolate, honey and nougat. But not bad for the price.
Grassy aromas include notes of corn and apple. This feels fresh and citric, with moderate roundness. Salty citrus and kiwi flavors are lasting on a crisp juicy finish.
Ripe, soft and oaky, with gentle, sweet flavors of blackberry, blueberry and cherry jam, mocha and toast. Easy to drink now with a great grilled steak.
Very gentle, perfumed honeysuckle notes are distinct and enticing on the nose. The palate follows this with a perfumed, opulent medium-sweetness that is reminiscent of sugar-plums and candied fruit pastilles: there are peach and plum and unbridled richness with a slight phenolic grip.
Podere Brizio delivers a super pleasurable and succulent Brunello with a soft, chewy consistency and a long, velvety finish. The bouquet is composed of dark fruit, mature blackberry, chocolate, espresso, smoke, crushed clove and toasted nut.
Made from 50% Syrah and 50% Mourvèdre, this rosé offers direct notes of red cherry, currant and raspberry on the nose and mouth. Hints of savory herbs and underbrush add depth to the palate, finishing short and slightly bitter. Drink up.
Talley produces some of the best Chardonnays on the Central Coast. Although this isn't one of their single-vineyard bottlings, it's a splendid wine, dry, crisp and silky. It shows complex citrus, vanilla and mineral flavors, and should pair with lobster, shrimp and scallops.
Stalky, soupy berry aromas come up shy on elegance. This feels clampy and hard with rocky tannins. Standard berry fruit flavors are overshadowed by gritty stalky blackened accents, while the finish is grating and uncushioned but long.
The 2010 vintage wines from Washington can be unforgiving on release but this wine—already a full five years old—is an exception. It shows a compelling assortment of jammy red and black fruit along with milk chocolate and barrel spices. The flavors convey both power and finesse with a spot-on sense of balance and a long finish that kicks it up a notch. It's drinking beautifully now but has a long life in front of it. Best from 2020 to 2027.
Big, juicy Pinot, dry and fruity, with layers of flavor that change with every sip. Black cherries, cola, rhubarbs, pomegranates, coffee, sweet tobacco, spice and oak all mingle in a myriad of sensations, finishing long and intense. Good now, but tannicly closed enough to warrant cellaring beyond 2007.
Simple and fruity, this has crisp apple and grapefruit flavors. It is light and refreshing and is ready to drink over the next few months.
A bit heavy and creamy, but there's something exotic about the oily, fat richness that suggests cashew nuts. With Meyer lemon flavors, it's an unctuous wine, and a very good value.
Aromatically, this is a very nice offering with solid berry fruit, cassis, spice and smoke. The palate feel is excellent, while the flavors of cherry and cassis are classic New World, deep and accented by tobacco on the finish. Lush and tannic; drink now through 2012.
This is a lightly off-dry rosé, with a soft texture and strawberry flavors. The wine is easy to drink now, bright with acidity and smoothly finished.
Aromas of sugared plums, herbs and black currants lead to black- and blue-fruit flavors that are surprisingly soft. One misses the tannins Cabernet is known for but it makes up for it elsewhere.
It's rare to find estate-grown, Willamette Valley Pinot, from a vineyard in high demand, made by a top-tier winemaker, at this price. Still young, tight and tart, this is a very pretty wine, with tangy cherry fruit, a touch of rhubarb pie, and plenty of acidity. Another year or two of bottle age would be optimal.
Light cherry and pomegranate fruit tones dive into a darker beet-focused nose on this bottling, backed up by touches of crushed asphalt. The flavors are delicate, with a sparse plum-fruit backbone lifted by strong herbal components of tarragon, marjoram, pepper and a bit of juniper.
Lush and round, floral and fruity, this only hints at residual sugar. The acidity makes for a bracing palate that offers highlights of clover and honeysuckle, plus rich notes of stone fruits.
This is a ripe, full-throttle wine. It has layers of blackberry and firm, dusty tannins. They are balanced by the juicy texture that gives the wine both freshness and the promise of some further aging. The wine is complex, rich and with good potential. Drink from 2018.
Three months in stainless steel result in a very pale wine with aromas of lemon peel and grapefruit flesh. The palate is painted with bright, citrus zest acidity throughout, yet retains the varietal's flavors of nectarine flesh and yellow melons. It makes a leading option for the unoaked crowd.

A 70-30 blend of Negroamaro grape and hearty Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a highly successful rendition with succulent concentration, a pretty purplish hue and a nice balance between ripe fruit and tar-like aromas. You'll detect blackberry, leather, spice, licorice and asphalt. A characteristic Cabernet Sauvignon note of bell pepper appears as well.
This offers aromas of ripe dark fruit, crushed rose, and a warm whiff of toast. On the palate, notes of clove and grilled sage accent a core of wild cherry. It's still young, with nervous acidity and assertive but refined tannins. Drink after 2018.
A bright and very pretty wine that bursts with raspberry and plum aromas. The palate is finely balanced and clean as a whistle, and in general this small-production bottling represents the region gracefully, but with some kick and power. It only gets richer and more serious with airing. Drink 2012–2022.
Can Paso Robles grow Pinot Noir? This wine suggests yes, at least in the cooler Willow Creek and Templeton Gap zones. This offers aromas of graphite, pomegranate and plums, followed by a palate that blends dark purple fruits with eucalyptus-like herbals. This will be even better with some time in bottle.
A good California Barbera, with medium weight, classic tart cherry flavors offset by leather and herb accents, and zingy, almost sharp acidity. Has good body and mouthfeel, and cries out for hearty food like big pasta dishes or cassoulet.
Each year, this wine is intended to be an experiment. This vintage's creativity involves the addition of soil from the Santa Rita Hills to vineyards in the Russian River Valley. Yeasty on the nose, the result is rich and decadent, a wine that's juicy and velvety in black and red fruit and pillowy tannins. A warmth of spice lingers on the finish.
Three things characterize this 100% varietal wine. It's crisp with acidity, fruity with lemons, limes and tropical fruits, and honeyed on the finish. Easy to drink it with slightly sweet, salted, smoky pork dishes.
Charred black plum, cola and licorice aromas show in this rare bottling of Petite Sirah from Santa Barbara County. The palate is streaked with dark purple and black fruit, its tarry tannins and sharp acidity dissolving rather quickly.
Ripe and fruity, this is a rich style of rosé. It has forward succulent strawberry flavors that are gently lifted by acidity. There is also a young, almost bitter character that, unusually, suggests this rosé needs to age. Drink summer 2016.
Considerably heftier than the light-bodied 2004 version, and a better wine for the extra weight, with baked apple, melon and spice notes amply filling out this wine's medium body. Finishes long, picking up a dusting of cinnamon and crushed stone.
A model for value Cab from Chile. It's dark, balanced, generous, aromatic and tasty. Aromas of blackberry and blueberry are just right given the price, and the cassis and blackberry character on the lush palate is also commendable. Round, smooth and satisfying. One of the best in its class.
Candied plum and red berry aromas smell like red licorice. Flavors are raisiny, with sourness and astringency.
Swathes of tarragon and lavender add lift to this stately Bordeaux-style blend. The palate is bright with sweet-tart black plum flavor, but supple and round, showing well-integrated oak notes and a fine layer of tannins on the finish.
The extreme youth of this stylishly packaged wine is on full display, with exuberant notes of crushed cranberry, raspberry, Earl Grey tea and rosewater on the nose. Lively acidity on the sip carries flavors of dried red fruit and touches of leather and tobacco. It's almost soda pop-like, and would go great with a slight chill on a warm day near the water.
Starts off with sturdy plum and fresh green character, but grows sweeter with air. Dominated by a dry chalk-earth flavor and feel; a good wine, but just not as giving as it can be. Imported by Foster's Wine Estates Americas.
From the heart of the Rutherford Bench, this estate-grown wine is a classic version of restraint and elegance, structured in dusty tannin with bursts of cedar, tomato leaf and cassis. Cabernet Franc makes up 8% of the blend, with 3% Merlot. This will benefit from time in the cellar; drink 2020–2023.
A little rough in texture and sweet on the finish, this pineappley brut is okay for everyday purposes, but the residual sugar is really too high for balance, especially at this price.
A standard issue Pinot Noir. It's dry and silky, showing decent cherry and cola flavors and quite a bit of tart acidity. Ready to drink now.
Actually a blend of Zin plus 10 other minor varietals in an old field blend, this complex wine fascinates with its intricately interlocked flavors. There's a sensation a second. Bottom line: This wine is delicious, ripely sweet although technically dry, and ageworthy.
A little sweet and sour in lemonade, pineapple juice and orange soda flavors, but clean and refreshing. Shows an exotic edge of honeysuckle, vanilla flower and jasmine tea.
This vintage-dated Pinot Noir is the newest addition to the Evolution lineup. Tart and tangy, its light and lively pomegranate and raspberry flavors come from grapes principally fermented in stainless steel. In your wine-drinking pantheon, it might find a comfortable place alongside a cru Beaujolais.
This Recioto opens with a beautiful, vibrant ruby color with purple highlights and deep dimension only to segue into typical aromas of bramble, blueberries, blackberry and chopped herbs. It's got power, sweetness and structure with chewy, tart tannins. Recioto is an ancient wine made with the same blend of grapes that goes into Amarone. Pair this sweet red with dried cinnamon cakes, chocolate-based desserts or a selection of aged cheeses.
Delicate and poised, this unusual Pinot Gris was fermented half in stainless and half in neutral oak, then kept on the lees for an extended period before bottling. The wine reveals itself gracefully with mixed green apple and white peach; hints of baking spice and a wash of vanilla wafer appear right at the finish line.
An intensely concentrated white from the famous historic vineyard, this youthful wine shows toasted oak around a palate-coating flirtation with tropical flavor, finding a supportive streak of minerality as it develops in the glass.
This is a soft, approachable juicy and unfussy wine, wrapped in sturdy stalks of oak and showy tannin. It offers a value-minded taste of blackberry jam and leather.
Shows many of the qualities of Chardonnay from this appellation, with high acidity and pure citrus fruit flavors. There's also a lot of new-oaky extract.
Soft and fruity, this is an attractive red-fruit flavored wine. It has touches of spice over the bright acidity and red-currant fruit. The tannins are still young although not enough to subdue the spirits of the lively fruit. Drink from 2017.
A clear attempt at a serious wine, given the heavy oak and ripeness. But maybe too toasty and touched up with popcorn and butter to meet the mark. Still, the mature apple character and inherent acidity keep it in the game. A winery to watch. Imported by Portet Wine Selections.
Earthy and warm on the nose, this has compost and leafy raspberry aromas. It shows good feel and balance, with light plum, cherry and citrus-infused tea flavors. The finish is good and solid, concluding with a tobacco note.
On the rich side, this is a full-bodied wine with pure green and white fruits. Acidity cuts through this richer texture, a lively fruity wine that is also full of ripe fruits. At the end, a more steely, mineral character emerges. Screwcap.
This superb Syrah, is a great followup to the 2009 bottling. There are incredibly ripe flavors of blackberry jam, currant, chocolate and toast, along with notes of grilled bacon and black pepper. The tannins are so rich and fine, you can drink this wine now.
86-88 Barrel sample. Balanced already, the caramel edge of wood well integrated with the soft, attractive tannins. The final is fresh, but remains soft.
Dark gold in color, this estate-grown wine blends bright, crisp orange, melon and caramel apple flavors with richer toasted oak and vanilla notes.
This is a little gem, perfectly capturing the mix of flower, body powder, citrus and stone that only Gewürztraminer can evoke. Graceful and elegant, it spreads evenly across the palate and slides down the back of the throat. The residual sugar—1.8%—puts it squarely in the Alsatian camp.
Recalling the time when Cahors was on the pilgrim route to Santiago in Spain, this wine is a solid, structured example of Malbec. Textured berry and black currant fruits are still developing alongside the dark, dry tannins. With the tannins and the final acidity, it needs to age. Drink from 2017.
The winery's first vineyard-designated Cab will be released officially in February 2006. Stylish, lighter and more elegant than the 2002 Cab, this weaves leaf and herbal accents throughout. 185 cases made.
Tastes highly confected, with strawberry and raspberry aromas and flavors that come across almost like bubble gum or cotton candy. Dissappointing.
A big, bold and fruity wine that is full of ripe berry fruits, rich and generous. This is Beaujolais at its most exuberant, a celebration of delicious fruit. It could age, but is ready to drink.
What a delightful wine. It's low in alcohol but completely dry, with acidity that thoroughly cleanses the palate. The complex flavors suggest lime zest, pineapple, flowers and tangy metals, and last for a long time on the finish.
The winery calls this brand new bottling a declassification of the estate Chardonnay, by barrel elimination. It's not quite as dramatic as their '09 estate, but, at half the price, it's a great buy. Dry, crisp and minerally, with citrus, pear and tropical fruit flavors, it's an elegant, Chablis-style Chard to drink now.
The small 2015 vintage didn't give John Benedetti much to work with, but he sources 60% from Bald Mountain Vineyard in Bonny Doon and 40% from Split Rail in Corralitos to deliver this stunner. Aromas of Marcona almond, buttered croissant and lemon preserves lead into a palate full of acidic energy. Salty, savory flavors of roasted nuts meet with warm buttercream and fresh lemon spray on the palate. It provides a full experience.
This expression of Barolo from the Bussia cru opens with fleshy pulp, rich concentration and very intense aromas of cola, cherry, humus, licorice and grated ginger. There's a chunky, vinous quality and although the wine lacks the finesse of the vintage, it will most certainly evolve nicely over the years.
A bit heavy and soft, although it's nicely dry, with good tannins. The cherry flavors are mixed with herbs, with a touch of smoky oak.
As often in Alsace Pinot Noir, the wine has too much wood for its fruit. What fruitiness it has—bitter cherries and red berries—is smothered by high toast giving a dry, edgy aftertaste.
This lively, 100% Sauvignon Blanc sports fresh flavors of grapefruit, lemon meringue and quinine—much like a cool-climate Viognier. Racy and fresh, it was mostly stainless-steel fermented, and is young enough to capture a bit of spritz in the mouthfeel.
Deftly calibrating sultry black fruit against savory earth tones, this blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc offers refinement. Toast, smoke and bramble integrate amid black plum and cherry flavors. The finish is powerful and persistent, fringed with finely grained tannins.
Dark, rich and sensuous, this is a ripe Champagne, boasting pear and apricot flavors. Although the aftertaste appears dry, the richness gives it a very sumptuous mouthfeel, leaving a long, full aftertaste.

Lean and austere, this is a tannic wine, with medicinal aromas, spice, stalky currant fruit flavors and tight texture.
This wine that shows the ripe tannins of Saint-Estèphe. It has a dry, dark core that's surrounded by rich black currant fruit. Situated close to Calon-Ségur, this is a stylish selection that exudes power and structure.
Poggio Querciolo (Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Petit Verdot) opens with bright fruit and rich overtones of smoke and toasted espresso bean. The wine is densely concentrated and soft with a bitter almond finish.
Light and reserved on the nose, with a hint of green apple and minerality but that's it. Feels citrusy and tangy, with lean, fresh flavors of lemon-lime and lettuce. Mild citric acidity keeps things lively on the finish.
From the Latour domaine, this dense wine is full of plum and sweet strawberry. At the same time, it is solid with an undertow of tannins and a dark texture. The acidity is already well integrated into this ripe and full-bodied wine. At the end, the signs of wood aging emerge and need to integrate. Drink from 2020.
Jammy, gritty berry aromas set up a rubbery, full-force palate that doesn't tread lightly. Roasted, almost burnt black-fruit flavors finish firm. Overall, this feels right, while the flavors run a touch baked, rustic and stalky.
Orangey aromas wrapped in not very subtle oak open this light-to-medium weight wine. Simple and a bit one-dimensional, it offers light pear flavors and a dry finish. Acceptable as an easy quaff, but not the stuff worthy of reserve designation.
Here's a special sparkling wine from Villa Sandi with intense notes of peachy fruit, sweet apple and pear. This Dry style wine tastes extra sweet and would make an excellent pairing partner with any fruit-based dish, whether sweet or salty (like prunes wrapped in prosciutto).
Mossy earthy black-fruit aromas open this powerful laser-focused Mencía. Eschewing the ligh floral style that's common in Ribeira Sacra, this is ripped and intense. Toasty spicy blackberry and plum flavors show a note of lemony oak. The finish is like a spice cabinet of clove, mint, pepper, etc. Drink through 2025.
Hugh Hamilton proves that Yalumba's success with this tricky variety isn't a fluke, offering genuine Viognier expression at a realistic price. Ripe muskmelon and apricot notes leave a round, full-bodied impression on the palate, finishing with musky spice. Drink now.
The Phinny Hill Vineyard is an excellent fruit source, but here there are clearly green tannins, and fruit flavors that seem underripe. It has the varietal flavors of Carmenère all right, but perhaps just a bit too green for most palates.
This young wine may need more time to reveal itself; though Resonance is proven as a top vineyard, here it seems shuttered and not yet woven together. Tart berry and cherry fruit turns sour in the finish, and does not display the power and depth of which it is capable.
This structured Barolo offers fragrances of forest floor, mushroom, toasted oak and a whiff of leather. The palate shows ripe berry, with spice notes and hints of well-integrated oak. It has bracing but ripe tannins and is a bit shy on length.

This soft, medium-sweet wine comes from one of the oldest producers in the Vinho Verde region, established in 1790. The wine is fruity and crisp, with a light sparkle. Bright lemon acidity comes through strongly at the end.
One of the driest Viogniers in California, and also one of the most elegant. Doesn't explode with exotic richness the way some Viogniers do, but it's a very fine white wine, noble and minerally, with nuances of tropical and citrus fruits. Really opens up a whole new direction for Viognier.
Undurraga has never been know for sparkling wines, and this brut isn't going to help much. It smells okay, with applesauce and lemon-lime stirring intrigue. But the palate and feel are off. It's foamy in the mouth, with undefined white-fruit flavors. Not ready for prime time.
This is a deeply ripe, authoritatively structured Syrah of great power and finesse. It's drinkable now for the velvety texture and massive flavors of grilled blackberries, blueberries, currants, dark unsweetened chocolate, leather, black pepper and lots of sweet, smoky new oak. But it's also fairly tannic. Very fine now, with a brief decant, and through 2013.
A touch of earth is bound up with the ripe, juicy and tart pear flavors. This wine is slender and clean with lemon freshness. The concentrated palate focuses on that crisp, ripe lemon note.
Soft and luscious, this Cabernet has a melted fruit quality, like cherry pie filling, with a scoop of vanilla and coffee ice cream. Tasty, but beyond that is great structure and bones. Drink this wine by 2015.
Enormously sweet, with sugared blackberry, currant and dark chocolate flavors that are frankly delicious. Nice as a nighttime winter apéritif, with some chocolaty confection and a roaring fire.
A chalky, mineral aroma leads to lively green apple and dried herb flavors. This wine is light-bodied and subdued but has enjoyable, savory flavors to complement its moderate fruitiness and an easy elegance that separates it from the pack.
This vineyard has been Demeter certified biodynamic, one of just a handful in Washington to achieve that recognition. It's all natural, ripe and full-flavored, with a wonderful, mouthfilling intensity. The flavors are a lovely mix of stone, yeast, flower and a jumble of citrus and apple fruits.
Produced in the small white-wine enclave within the Madiran appellation, this wine is a blend of the two emblematic grapes of the region.

This generous rosé was whole-cluster pressed, yielding bright, fresh flavors of just-picked strawberries. The flavors are uplifted with a backing of wet stone minerality, and if any wine captures springtime in a bottle, this is it.
A white fruit note leads this wine on a rich, spice-strewn path. The acidity cuts into the richness, putting the slightly oxidative character into perspective. With its rich, yeasty character, it's fit for drinking now.
A ripe, bold and impressive wine, showing yellow peaches and pineapple flavors to go with its tight core of minerality. There is a touch of wood, but the main thrust is for broad fruit, open and welcoming.
Winemaker Flint Nelson co-ferments this unusual Mourvèdre with Syrah and Grenache, yielding a wine with unusually smooth integration of flavors. Multifaceted and supple, this has layers of ripe fruit, spice, lead pencil, cedar and clean earth flavors, which continue smoothly onto the medium-long finish.

VM takes a huge leap in the Syrah race with this wine. It's inky purple in color, with hints of pepper, espresso and black olive accenting blueberry and blackberry fruit. A plush coating partially conceals ample structure, while the richly textured finish lingers a good long time. Drink now–2025.
Fresh apple and pear aromas are accented with notes of white flowers on this delicate Pinot Grigio. It's bristling with lemon-lime acidity, but pleasantly concentrated citrus flavors, and just a hint of reeds on the finish.
This is an intensely spicy wine, full of lychee and peppered pineapple flavors. It's rich, also showing a strong mineral texture. Medium sweet in style, it is packed with ripe fruit with a touch of honey. The aftertaste shows a fresher side. Drink from 2016.
Very sharp and acidic, with a powerfully grassy core. It might be thought of as Loire valley-style Sauvignon Blanc, but without the minerality. Herb and lemon rind flavors dominate.
The well-defined bright lime and mineral aromas and light peach-pear flavors ride a fine acid backbone. Despite the crispness and mineral notes characteristic of this appellation, the mouthfeel is fairly full. Very approachable, with a clean, fresh finish. Tailor-made for shellfish and salads. Drink now–2003.
An initial touch of sulphur blows off quickly to reveal aromas of apricot, sage and toasted almond. Soave Vigne di Mezzane would pair with steamed vegetable dumplings or fried rice.

Turriga is this estate's top red wine that boasts the extraction and sophistication to pair with Gouda or sharp Cheddar. This vineyard-designate wine is mostly Cannonau (85%) with smaller percentages of Carignano, Bovale and Malvasia Nera. It's firm and pulpy with young tannins. You can age this wine five years or more.
Minty and sharp, with a menthol edge to the cherries, but the wine is crisp and has a polished, silky texture, so it's pretty good.

The smoky finish also shows a crisp, almost hard-edged metallic note. Stylized and appealing, but still tight—should be better in a year or two.

This carries true-to-variety flavors of peppery blackberry fruit, here cloaked in coffee and toast from aging in 40% new French and American oak barrels. The lemony acids contribute to the overall balance and ageworthy structure.
Picking up just a tad of spice from the 2% Syrah addition, this offers aromas of freshly tanned leather, blackberry jam and mint-laced coffee. The palate is all about gripping tannins, cigar ash and tart cherry skins, proving quite extracted but certain to improve with a bit of patience and mellowing.

Polished mineral nuances come on the heels of berry fruit and floral aromas. This is a spicy and piquant wine with cool freshness and delicate fruit flavors that last a long time on the palate.
This is pure varietal, about one fifth new oak. From young vines, it's sharp-toned, dark and juicy. Cassis, dark chocolate and coffee showcase a wine with a strong grip, tight and tannic. This needs time, but the fruit is crisply defined and immaculate; the varietal character peeks through in a hint of tanned leather.

It's not often you find a varietal Piquepoul Blanc outside of the south of France, but this seems to suit well to the hot Texan climate.

This herbal, crisp Chardonnay is clean and bracing. The winery name suggests the flavors, which have a thistly component, along with tangerine, Meyer lemon, lime, green apple and tonic. Very long and very fresh.

This Malbec-led blend (with Petit Verdot and Tannat) is muscular and piercing on the nose, with aromas of brick dust, black cherry, cassis and raisin. The palate is saturated and creamy, with a lactic sensation competing with rubbery tannins. Flavors of vanilla, raw oak, tomato, plum, herbs and chocolate are complex and finish with multiple interest points along with mild heat. Give this more time, if possible. Best from 2018 through 2022.
This is immensely promising, offering scents of slate, slightly leesy notes, white peach and pineapple. But on the palate, the flavors aren't quite as fresh, changing over to dried pineapple and golden raisin, and while the mouthfeel is rich and sweet upfront, the wine seems to dry up a bit on the finish, where it shows a touch of bitterness. Probably best to drink it young.

Nice and oaky and rich, from a vineyard in the heart of the cool-climate southern part of Russian River Valley. Acidity stars, giving zesty balance to the ripe pineapple, green apple, Key lime pie and pear flavors. New oak, to the tune of 40%, adds an opulent touch.
This blend of 60% Grenache and 40% Syrah is atypically big and burly in 2009, showing some intense coffee and charcoal notes layered over black cherry fruit. Dusty tannins mark the finish, so serve it alongside fatty meats where the tannins will work in the wine's favor.
A deceptively approachable wine. Its gorgeous fruits are right up front, their ripeness powered by a generous, complex texture. There is concentration, but it is surrounded by so much richness. It can almost be drunk now, but should age well.
A zesty nose promises refreshment and poise. The palate not only keeps this promise but tops it. Orange, mandarin and lemon frame riper peach and Mirabelle plum explode like a firework of fruit on the palate.

A densely concentrated but unbalanced wine, it opens with aromas of stewed prunes, plum, oak, coconut and espresso. The heavy wood influence carries over to the palate. Black cherry notes are overwhelmed by oak, vanilla extract and coffee bean. Drying wood tannins dominate the finish.

Apple blossoms perfume pristine lemon, lime and tangerine in this invigorating off-dry Riesling. Vivacious and brisk, it's uncomplicated yet refreshingly thirst quenching. Drink now.

When people talk about good value Cabs from Chile, this is what they should be referring to. The nose is balanced and offers plenty of clean berry aromas, while the palate is fresh, light in weight and mildly citrusy, with flavors of cassis, plum and raspberry. More snappy and fresh than weighty.

An okay, light- to medium-weight Zinfandel that veers into stewy flavors and aromas before falling a tad flat on the finish.
At 40 acres, Saint-Pierre is small for the Médoc, but it is certainly performing well. As fine as the 2005, the 2008 is a stylish wine that also packs a firm punch of dense fruit, firm tannins and mouthwateringly juicy acidity. For medium-term aging.
Spiced gumdrop and rooty sweetness carry the massive nose to a big but balky palate of baked, roasted black fruits, cassis and tire rubber.

Plump, sweet and creamy in texture, with apple and citrus flavors that offer simple, straightforward pleasure. Good quality, impressive for the 50,000 cases produced.
The wine is velvet soft with smooth red berries and gentle tannins. It has a line in acidity along with spice and a rounded texture. Drink this lightly wood-aged wine now.

It opens up beautifully with ample aeration and is true to variety without giving the impression of cheap perfume, emphasizing spice over powdery scents and showing plenty of ripe fruit, from Asian pear, to pineapple to jicama.
Lightly herbal on the nose, but otherwise it's ripe and ready to go. The feel is slightly tannic and tight, but it's as fresh and healthy as can be. Flavors of raspberry, red plum and mild spice are comported and correct. Finishes long, with vigor. Drink now through 2014.
This is the entry-level wine from this producer based in the Marne Valley. That's the land of Pinot Meunier and this Champagne contains 74% of the grape, giving a soft rounded wine. It has delicious acidity with citrus and red-berry fruit and a lightly crisp texture that is balanced by the soft ripe aftertaste. Drink now.
A pretty nose suggests cherry candy, sandalwood and a whiff of maple syrup. Those pie cherry and baking spice aromas continue in the mouth, with a hint of truffle. Beautifully balanced and blended—nine vineyards contributed.
A woody element gives a dry and toasty character. The fruit is still juicy with some good acidity. Now fully developed, the dry, old wood flavor does spoil the fruit.
This is dense yet fresh, with dark berry and mild earth aromas. It feels lively, forceful and solidly built, with blackberry, creamy chocolate, toast and spice flavors that are all in equal, balanced portions. Long and warm on the finish.

This is unusual for a reserve, in that it's lower in alcohol than the regular bottling, and more cases were produced. The light fruits and herbs—green apple and lemon verbena in particular—are highlighted with tarragon and citrus peel. The complexity compensates for the just-on-the-edge ripeness, and time in 20% new oak adds a buttery note to the finish.
Quite light aromas are followed by dry, somewhat diluted fruit flavors. The variety seems to get lost and it drinks more like a generic white wine.

Shows all the hallmarks of great Mondavi Reserve. Ageworthy and complex, with enormously ripe, rich fruit, classic chocolate, cassis plus cream and spice from new oak. So smoothly voluptuous now, it goes down like velvet, but the tannin-acid balance will easily hold this wine through 2015.

Lots of spritz and a forward, peachy, fruit-driven set of flavors; almost like a Prosecco but with a bit more concentration and powerful, peachy fruit. Just under four percent residual sugar, yet it retains enough acid to give it some verve, and clocks in at just 10.5% alcohol.

This is not an obvious wine, but one that creeps up slowly, takes time and impresses quietly. It delivers depth rather than power. Glints of pepper and allspice shine amid the restrained red, tart cherry fruit. The slightest of tannic grips stems from concentration rather than extraction. It's elegant Alsace Pinot, quiet but firm.
Brick red in color, this wine also smells of brick and smoke. On the palate, it's moderately structured and robustly ripe, showing burly blueberry and mocha chocolate flavors with unfettered fervor.

It's firm, dark and toasty, with full-flavored black-cherry fruit accented with dense veins of espresso, charred nuts and bitter chocolate. The structure supports those dark notes, and the chewy tannins and lengthy finish amplify them. Drink now through 2028.

Bosc pear, yellow apple and honey scents follow through to the radiant, medium-bodied palate, along with nectarine and Mediterranean herb notes. An energizing mineral tone adds depth.

Cascina Adelaide always stands out in a crowd of Barolos thanks to the overall intensity of its Nebbiolo characteristics. Thanks to careful winemaking techniques, Preda takes that extra step: the fruit is brighter here and the spice notes are noticeably more piquant. You'll also taste fine mineral notes, violets and green olive.
Rich and dry, with pleasant blackberry, cherry, currant and cedar flavors. Sometimes Central Coast Cabs can be green, but not this one. An elegant, complex wine for drinking now and through 2012.

It's certainly delicious now, but this should age well through 2022.
This is a classy package, and the wine lives up to it, showing extra dimensions of power and weight. The flavors are layered and unfold gracefully; apple to citrus to pineapple.

Intense and concentrated, this puts to rest any ideas that Merlot is incapable of making “real” wine. The flavors are smooth and chocolaty, the mouthfeel liquorous, ripe and lush. High-toned fruits and flowers slide into the mellow tannins, all resolving in a superripe, decadently rich finish.
Here's a soft and plush Montepulciano d'Abruzzo that should pair well with meat dishes or oven-cooked pasta, such as lasagna. Concentrated flavors of black cherry, cassis and berry flavors are followed by a polished finish.

With apricot, orange, honey, butter cream and vanilla flavors, it's a simple wine at a fair price.
Apple blossom intrigues on the nose of this light-bodied, low-oaked white. It's both steely and revealing, showing succulent mango, peach and pear. The acidity is lively and balanced.

Chock-a-block full of strawberry, black cherry and a sliver of orange peel, this wine is big-boned, well-structured and fleshy. Mouthfilling and juicy, the palate shows touches of black tea and tobacco, making for a lively tension between the earthiness and exuberance of fruit. Drink now through 2022.

Opening with a pretty, yet rich fruit nose of dark cherry and plum, the structured wine has been tamed into a soft, chocolate-brushed finish with just the perfect amount of acidity.

This is a crisp, medium-bodied wine, with pleasant aromas of apricot, lemon and pineapple. A smidgen of almond nuttiness marks the finish.

You'll want to stick this Bordeaux blend in the cellar because right now the tannins dominate. There's a very rich vein of cherry, currant, cassis and new oak flavor, and the wine is totally dry, but those tannins give it a sticky astringency that obviously calls for time out. Give it a year or so, then try again.

Ripe plum and berry aromas are supported by a full dose of smoky, savory oak. The palate is round yet jagged, while flavors of toasty, chocolaty berry fruits are also lightly herbal and heavily oaked.

The blend on this Claret-style red is a bit different this year—half Merlot, 40% Cabernet Franc and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon. As with the other 2011 Cayuse reds, this has a noticeable shift to floral, delicate aromas, with the savory/funk present but somewhat muted.

With its fresh, bright fruit, touched by minerality and flintiness, this is a delicious but relatively lightweight Chablis. The fruit is pure, clean, tightly crisp, with just a more exotic hint of pineapples.

Your basic California Chardonnay, showing ripe tropical fruit, honey and oak flavors, brightened with acidity. Pretty simple, but not bad for the price.
An intensely herbaceous wine, its very fresh acidity a part of the juicy currants, gooseberry and grapefruit flavors. It is light, fresh, a fine apéritif wine.
Shows a dryness and earthiness that mark Calera's most ageworthy Pinot Noirs. But that doesn't mean it's not good now. It is, with impressive black cherry, licorice, bacon, vanilla and sandalwood flavors, wrapped into a drily crisp, silky texture. Drink through 2012, at least.
Vibrant fruit, red apple and blue flowers appear with intensity on the nose to create a racy, clean red wine. The acidity is good, as is the structure, but the 15% alcohol does hit the palate hard. Pair it with cream-based pasta (to counter the alcohol), white meat and roasted winter vegetables.
Warm and the slightest bit raisiny, but overall it's a bright, fruity blend of Monastrell and Tempranillo that's tasty and worth every dollar. Flavors of black cherry and vanilla are cuddly, while the finish is long and of medium potency. A treat for those who enjoy fruity, somewhat softer reds.
A little on the sugary sweet side, but the apricot and tangerine jam flavors are brightened by crisp acidity.
This is a big, somewhat heavy Pinot Noir in its youth. It has the weight of a Grenache, with furry tannins housing flavors of red and black cherries, red currants and mocha. It's quite a good wine, but juvenile. Give it 2–3 years in the cellar, and it should glide through 2014 or so.

Syrah can be expressive even when slightly green, as it is here. Strawberry and raspberry fruit flavors are set amidst sharp, slightly chalky, citrusy acids. Best to drink this with grilled meats.

Pair it with oven-baked cheese flan or crispy fried potatoes. You need fatty foods to match that sharp acidity.

This wine is frankly high in alcohol, clocking in at 16% by volume. But it's also incredibly delicious, offering soft waves of milk chocolate, black cherry jam, red currants, bacon and black pepper. Drink this wine at night, with rich stews or barbecue, but be careful about driving.

Terrific, versatile food wine.
Aromas of new leather, iris, ripe berry, baking spice and a balsamic note of menthol come together on this. On the palate, notes of clove and star anise accent a core of ripe Marasca cherry and crushed raspberry. Fine-grained tannins provide the framework.
With a soft, heavy mouthfeel and hot, candied raspberry and cherry flavors, this Reserve Pinot is a disappointment. It's okay, but tastes like a simple little Pinot Noir for drinking now.
This is showing a bit of muscle, and some still-integrating barrel flavors, but it's already a wine that delivers plenty of pleasure. Forgive the flaky faux-wax topping (not thick enough to be called a real capsule) and enjoy the well-ripened blackberry fruit, the nicely-layered creamy chocolate, the touch of underbrush and the appealing length. Drink now through 2022.
This is a bold, ripe wine, full of fruit and equally full of dense tannins. A blend that includes Cabernet Sauvignon, it is solid, powerful and spicy from wood aging. The structure is still young in this impressive wine. Drink from 2019.
This is charred smelling, with herbal, jammy, heavy aromas of mocha, coffee and berry fruit. It feels syrupy and cloying, with heavy extraction, borderline overripeness and sweet flavors of brown sugar, mocha, baked blackberry and oak. Warmth and a note of carob dominate the finish.
This is a round style of wine, with its ripe apple fruits and soft texture set against a fresh, tangy backdrop. Although it is young, the wine is very drinkable now, but the fresh acidity will allow it to mature further. Best drink it from 2017.
A négociant wine, sharp and spicy, with vivid acidity and some real punch in the midpalate. The flavors suggest thistle and fern – real Northwest fare – rather than riper fruit. It sets up well in the mouth and despite alcohol listed at just 12.5%, has good presence and power.
Delicate and feminine with tight peach and apricot weaved into an attractive aromatic embroidery. Extremely dense lather builds up each time you swirl your glass, making this wine perfect for dried or baked desserts. Imported by Vitis Imports.
This is richly concentrated and dense, showing an inky dark color with blackberry, leather and cured meat notes. A soft chocolate tone appears on the close.
This still-young blackberry-rich wine is bursting with fruit. Its structure is restrained, with a background of tannins that support the juicy fruitiness. Produced from organic grapes, it will need to age further, so drink from 2019.
Ripe, juicy pear notes make nose and palate immensely appetizing. They are highlighted by zippy, fresh lemon accents that create a lovely balance on this fun, fresh summer wine.
There is an attractive, light prickle on the tongue of this fresh, crisp and fruity wine. It is dry, tensely tangy with a green, zesty character. Drink now.
This soft Grenache has flavors of red cherries, licorice, beef jerky and pepper. It's a dry wine, but very rich in smoky, caramelly cedar. Drink now.
Almost black in color, this is a hugely dense, dark wine. It brings out the tannic side of the grape with hints of black coffee and dark chocolate. Under all this concentration, there is some fruit that is still waiting to get out: black plum and black currants with fresh acidity. Just wait until 2017.
Smells ashy, but gets better as it airs, showing ripe, flashy raspberry fruit and a coating of sweet oak.
A rich wine, with delicious juicy white fruit flavors that roll around the mouth. The fruits are right up front initially, but then the structure of toast, apple skin tannins and some spice come in, giving fine complexity, promising good aging. Keep for 4–5 years, probably more. Imported by Wilson Daniels Ltd. Cellar Selection.
Intense but perilously close to syrupy, with narrow but heady blueberry, blackberry and black pepper flavors. There's an exorbitant amount of sweetness upfront and on the finish, but the middle is less than stellar, even showing some medicinal notes.
Bristling acidity lends vitality to this full-bodied Chardonnay. Fresh tangerine, lemon and lime flavors are moderately concentrated on the palate, accented by touches of savory nut and smoke.
Based in the village of Cramant, Voirin-Jumel has access to Grand Cru Chardonnay vineyards. This crisp and tight wine is packed with acidity, fresh citrus and a taut, steely texture. It is still young and fruity, and could do with some bottle age.
Fragrant and deeply colored, I like the intensity of the flavors, which include dried herb, orange peel, citrus and pear. It's an interesting, somewhat offbeat wine—a more complex, more rustic and evolved style.
At first tight and a bit unyielding, it sends up little wafts of scent—cinnamon and spice—before slowly broadening out with classic Bordeaux notes of lead pencil, cedar and graphite. Lean but not mean, this shows the grip and polish of very skillful winemaking, married to superb fruit. Classic black cherry and cassis, with the acidity and lean muscularity that distinguishes the best Washington Cabs.
Aromas of toasted bread and vanilla echo in the rich, buttery flavors of this full-bodied and lavishly textured white Rhône-style blend. The oaky spices make it serious and complex while mild pear and almond flavors take a second seat.
Sharp scents of rind and perfume seem almost Viognier-like. The bright flavors echo the aromas, with citrus rind, oranges and apples. Nicely focused.
Features citrus-flower and lime aromas. Lightweight, and with a slight spritz, this is a correct and refreshing Vinho Verde, with tart lime and quartz-mineral elements. A blend of 95% Alvarinho and 5% Trajadura.
More mature and minerally than most, with some earthy notes as well as a sharp smokiness. Apple, citrus and grapefruit flavors dominate the developed, smooth-textured palate. Nice overall, with good body. A stand-up cava.
This big and imposing wine pushes the boundaries with assertive charcoal and smoked meat aromas, tons of tannin and an oaky, astringent finish. Best to drink after 2022, by which time the mouthfeel may have mellowed.
Richly textured, dense and soft in the mouth, this mountain-grown Syrah has slightly sweet flavors of cherry and blackberry jam, mocha, licorice and root beer. It's an easy wine to toss back with everyday fare.
Aromas of pear, citrus and almond should be familiar to anyone who knows Chilean Chardonnay, but to call this wine elevated or beyond regular would be a stretch. The palate is slightly lemony and green, and the finish has a persistent tang. Seems like basic Casablanca Chard to us.
Held back longer than most Chardonnays, this single-vineyard wine is beginning to pick up bottle complexity. It's a connoisseur's wine, not dazzlingly rich and sweet, but dry, acidic and minerally, with lemon and orange citrus fruit flavors. You have to appreciate subtlety to like this artisanal wine. Should evolve in interesting ways over the next six years.
Not to be confused with the winery's Vintner's Reserve, this has a limited two-barrel production and is priced lower. While cranberry and citrus flavors feature in both, this one has a pretty, lingering chocolate note, suggesting extended aging in oak.
Open on the bouquet, with a pleasant spiciness. The flavors veer toward tangy nectarine and apricot, while the snappy finish is long and slightly bitter. Shows good citrus character and plenty of pop. Quite good for a white from central Spain.
This is the first Dineen designate from :Nota Bene, and it's worth chasing down. Focused dark purple and black fruits line up—cherry, plum and cassis—with a rich layer of espresso and a lick of graphite following. The 22 months in barrel brings an interesting hint of caramel to a nicely balanced finish.
Dry and delicious, this lightly colored rosé opens with a compelling waft of rose water and exudes copper-pink color. A refreshingly searing acidity maintains vibrancy from start to finish, accented in grapefruit. This quaff is great on its own or throughout a meal.
A touch of mineral astringency accents crisp, primary flavors of white peach and melon in this sprightly off-dry Riesling. It's not a complex wine but tart tangerine acidity marks a refreshing finish. Drink now.
This well-oaked Cab opens with reedy berry scents along with notes of lemon peel, coconut, tobacco and black currant. A narrow palate evaporates into a pool of snappy acidity, while short, choppy, citric flavors of red plum and currant end with oaky vanilla but even more wiry acidity. Drink through 2019.
This blend of 95% Shiraz and 5% Viognier displays some cool-climate character in its red berry and herbal pepper notes. It's medium bodied and slightly dusty in texture, with a tart, mouthwatering finish. Drink it over the next few years.
Aragonez, or Tempranillo, is grown more widely in Alentejo than in Setúbal where this wine comes from. The move gives the wine a softer character, with fresh blackberry acidity and a smooth, ripe fruitiness. It has some gentle tannins to balance the fruit. Drink now.
LAN's modern interpretation of Rioja is ripe, fragrant and beefy, with mineral, charcoal, pine and black cherry coating the unctuous nose. Runs a touch soft and plump on the palate, probably a reflection of the hot '03 vintage. But along the way there's black plum, licorice, molasses and maple flavors. A big, new-wave wine that has a lot going for it.
Once conceived as a Merlot specialist, Northstar seems to have drifted, well, south, and is now crafting more of a Right Bank Bordeaux blend. A confusing array of vineyard sites are packed into the wine, which seems to have wandered into a kind of mid-life identity crisis. Pleasant strawberry and raspberry fruit anchors a rather simple palate.
Comes out of the bottle with a slightly smoky, struck-match aroma, then settles down into melon and pear tinged with anise. It's full bodied, but not long or intense enough on the finish to warrant a higher rating.
Lightly amylic-pear drop, resin, mineral, stone-fruit and peach-skin aromas dominate the youthful nose of this wine. Very clean and mineral-focused. The medium body and vibrant acidity give the palate a firm texture. Given its short, crisp finish, it is best consumed between now and through 2013. Good by the glass or with light fare.
Classic Albariño aromas of granitic minerality combine with apple and stone-fruit notes gets this off to a good start. A smooth, citric palate and clean, fruity flavors of orange and peach finish easy and fresh, with proper acidity.
This blend of Syrah, Petit Verdot, Aragonez and Alicante Bouschet shows power, with dense tannins shouldered by ripe black fruit flavors and a solid structure. From the Estremoz region of the Alentejo, it's a powerhouse of flavors and juicy acidity. Drink after 2016.
Shows some ultraripe Porty flavors and bitterness that come from the tannins of raisin skins. That accentuates the dryness, and compromises what otherwise is a pleasant Dry Creek Valley Zinfandel.
Very forward and correct, with a bit of piquant snap to the nose. That same perky quality carries over to the palate, where some coffee character darkens blackberry fruit. Racy and solid, and on the money.
Honeysuckle perfume introduces this fragrant fresh Riesling. A shade off dry on the palate, it balances spine-tingling lemon and tangerine flavors against earthier notes of wax and crushed minerals. Drink now through 2019.
Elegant but gripping, with cherry, violet and leather notes on the nose, followed by a rapberry and rose-infused palate. Black earth and berry notes flavor the long finish. The very austere tannins will need until 2012 to come around.
This is all Pepper Bridge fruit, a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Merlot. Nice fruit flavors of cherries and cassis roll into a lightly peppery wine with a mix of barrel toast flavors and a textural midpalate.
Lovely, fresh and lightly sparkling, this vibrant, delightful wine opens with heady violet and red berry scents. The refined, almost ethereal palate delivers crushed raspberry, strawberry, tangerine and ginger notes alongside tangy acidity.
Although based in the Hunter, Brokenwood has reached into South Australia for this Shiraz, which offers lifted, rather perfumed aromas of raspberries and strawberries supported by vanilla underpinnings. A hint of mint creeps in on the finish, framed by supple tannins and crisp acidity. Drink now-2015.
Starts with clean but basic cherry/berry aromas, but with a candied twist. The palate is more lean and sharp than ideal, with zippy red fruit flavors that carry some scour. Lively and peppy, but a little sharp in the long run.
This wine went through native yeast and malolactic fermentation before aging for more than two years in all French oak and the results are mixed. There's faint cherry amid a heavy load of forest floor and wild horse, the wine's layers somewhat muddled.
A juicy, delicious Sangio, whose bright acidity underscores a lush mix of raspberries, blackberries, boysenberries and plum. The alcohol is a substantial 14.8%. The wine benefits from an extra year of bottle age, and is now beginning to hint at grace notes of leaf and tobacco.
Although the oak in this wine has settled, it still coats the mouth with a smooth film. Grape, clay and barnyard aromas lead the way, with more barnyard and berry fruit flavors following. Drink up.
There's a ton of dark, chocolaty toast atop the succulent fruit in this tasty Merlot. The spicy plum and black cherry flavors carry hints of sweet tobacco and chocolate cake. Though not a massive wine, its broad flavors are full and engaging.
The best of Korbel's sparkling wines, and one that can stand next to bubblies that cost two or three times as much. Rich and dry, it has a very creamy mouthfeel, with subtle, complex flavors of lime, grapefruit, strawberry and yeast. It's a brut-style wine made from Chardonnay and Pinot Noir.
This reserve-level Cabernet—made from grapes sourced partly from 35-year-old vines—is lovely in its wealth of detail. A brambly, elegant mouthful of berry and cherry flavors mingles with a note of rose petal. The finish is soaked in graphite, with length, grip and finesse.
Hints of cinnamon and clove reflect a small amount of new oak aging, but the dominant flavors are of plum and dusty earth. Not a powerhouse, it's a balanced, food-friendly wine at a reasonable price‹the kind of wine that wins friends, not ratings competitions.
The Herrenberg vineyard has a produced a wonderfully rich Grüner, its rich tropical character broad but never far from freshness. Pear juice and peaches dominate, with just a fleck of spice, pierced through with mouth watering acidity.
Aromas of menthol, red berry, coffee and blue flower waft from the glass along with whiffs of chopped aromatic herb. The aromas follow through to the velvety palate along with Marasca cherry, raspberry and licorice. Firm, fine-grained tannins provide a structured framework. Drink 2025–2033.
Mature black cherry, leather, grilled herb, ground pepper and balsamic notes are just some of the aromas and flavors of this stunning Nebbiolo. It's well balanced with bracing, noble tannins and bright acidity but it still needs time to come together. Drink 2018–2035. Giuliana Imports, PDX Wine.
90-92 Barrel sample. A finely balanced wine with expressive acidity and ripe blackberry fruit flavors. The aftertaste is dry from the firm but managed tannins.
This shows more texture than fruit, but it has weight and richness that will come forward in the next two years. Its clean apple fruit is likely to be the dominant factor.
Neutral on the nose except for a whiff of apple, this is a wine to drink now. A round, pulpy palate is balanced by citric acidity, while waxy flavors of baked apple and peach finish briny and round, with a hint of green banana.
Dark garnet in the glass, this wine has a nose of strawberry, black plum, caramel and smoked meat. It offers a good balance of acidity and tannins, with flavors of blackberry, blueberry, smoked meat, vanilla and mocha. The vanilla flavor is extended on the palate thanks to lingering silky tannins that eventually dissolve in a note of orange zest.
This boasts thick, sun-drenched notes of mature fruit, intense spice and moist earth. The wine's nose is slightly stewy in essence and has some medicinal qualities on the finish. Drink it with pasta and ground beef ragù.
Light in color, this wine brings aromas of peppermint, herb, sarsaparilla and spice. The flavors are light and transparent, showing a very pretty sense of styling.
Merlot makes up half of this wine, with the balance Cabernet Sauvignon (40%) and Cabernet Franc. It announces itself with nuanced aromas of herb, dried leaves and flowers, along with black currant. The flavors are palate coating and textured, showing depth but also restraint.
Blonde de Seigneur was first produced by Georges Vernay in 2000. It is a wine which shows up elegance rather than power, great black fruit expression with fine tannins. It has some dry tannic structure, but there is plenty of fruit here, perfumed and with layers of smoky wood. A really great wine from a medium vintage.
At first this profoundly compelling wine seems rather light, but as it pirouettes on a base of cherry and sassafras, it constantly shifts and sends up shafts of previously undetected flavors. Popcorn, saffron and just the faintest hint of barnyard emerge—suddenly it becomes a full-throttle cherry bomb that can best be described as yummy.
This is a lavish, layered and lovely wine from an extreme coastal vineyard above Cambria. It shows fresh-cut fennel, wild mint, dried lavender, Earl Grey tea and cran-raspberry aromas on the great nose. The palate's strong herbal character of crushed sagebrush, wild thyme and black pepper spices up the dark plum and strawberry flavors.
All of the charms of this Merlot, Syrah and Zinfandel blend are on the surface, but what a pretty surface it is. Polished raspberry and cherry fruit, bacon, cream and a splendid array of flashy spices characterize the flavors.
A very light shade of pink, this wine is quite delicate, maybe too much so, showing light strawberry, bubblegum, nectarine and tangerine-peel notes on the nose. The palate offers a lot of texture but not a ton of flavor, with raspberry and dried-lemon elements.
This spent about a year in 30% new oak, and some portion was American. Those aggressive scents and flavors still dominate, with the typical vanilla and pickle-barrel highlights. More bottle age is in order for maximum enjoyment. At the moment the fruit is primary and the barrel notes not entirely integrated. Drink after 2020.
This is an intriguing and complex red with loads of minerality, black pepper, charred meat, earth and charcoal. But the fruit notes are in there, too: prunes and red, ripe cherry. The tannins are a bit nervous still and the wine should be cellared a few more years.
Spicy black cherry aromas are lightly floral, lemony and suggestive of a woodsy candle. The palate is balanced and bold, with ripe blackberry and spicy flavors. Rich, strong and a bit chocolaty on the back end. A winning wine for the price.
Gorgeously purple in hue, this sharp, peppery Lemberger offers loads of concentrated blackberry and plum flavors. It's lavishly textured yet sharply balanced, marked by crisp acidity and fine tannins. Savory complexities of smoked meat and tobacco linger through a long, velvety finish.
This Merlot-based rosé is a bit on the sweet side. It's juicy and simple, with red plum fruit that finishes with enough acidity for balance.
Sweet cherry aromas seem almost like Grenache atop graham crackers, while the palate is lean, green and topped off by brandied cherry. Adequate as a cheap quaffer but not up to the next level.
Now in a smart clear blue bottle, this is Aveleda's estate wine. It is always a classic, with just some extra weight to give it distinction. The flavors are apple, brightened with lime, finishing with vibrant acidity.
This is brilliantly purple in color, with jumpy, untamed black-fruit aromas. In the mouth, it is tannic and clawing, with a cheek-drilling mouthfeel. Syrupy blackberry flavors offer baking spice and clove accents, while the finish is showing unabsorbed oak and monster tannins.
There's an attractive meaty or earthy quality to this Primitivo that gives the wine dimension and personality. Black olive, red berry and spice come through and the wine tastes thick and succulent in the mouth. It leaves a lingering endnote of spice and smoke. 4 g/l RS.
This estate red is named after its mountainous locale—a brambly vineyard on Pritchard Hill above Oakville. It combines quite ripe Cabernet Sauvignon with 15% Cabernet Franc, 15% Petit Verdot and 5% Merlot, projecting power and prestige with perfumed violet, dark cherry and savory leather and tobacco notes. Soft, pliable tannins add weight and texture. More time in bottle should add nuance; enjoy 2024–2034.
The Borsao brand is a bargain pioneer, and while the wines aren't $4.99 anymore they are still squarely “value” oriented. This rosé is fairly steely and fresh, with pithy grapefruit and nectarine flavors. Lean and peppery on the finish, and ready to be consumed right away.
Volcanic ash over granite gives this vineyard its structured character, which carries over into this wine. Wood aged in large barrels, it has a rich firm character that will allow the wine to develop. Powered by acidity and tannins, the ripe black fruits are juicy and concentrated. Drink this wine from 2018.
A great apéritif, this is bone dry and tart in acidity. It really gets those tastebuds whistling, with some good lime, grapefruit, lemongrass and honey flavors.
A green-gold shade, this wine leaps up with buttery scents and flavors, at first more nutty than toasty. It has a tight core of mixed stone fruits, with toasty barrel flavors to wrap it up.
This is for you, if you like your Zins in a sweet, soft style. It tastes like the filling from a black­berry and cherry pie, dusted with exotic spices, like cinnamon and black pepper.
This hasn't been my favorite Testarossa Pinot, although it's a very good one. It's a big, ripe wine, possibly ageworthy, with exuberant cherry, raspberry and new oak flavors. It has a gritty tannin structure that contributes to a slightly rustic mouthfeel.
A rich, rounded wine with a dominant, soft, Merlot character. The wine also offers a firm tannic base over which there is a more fruity character and spice and fruit cake flavors on the finish.
This is a pleasantly quaffable Viognier, with restrained apricot and melon aromas and flavors. It's medium bodied, without much texture, but a clean, refreshing finish.
With its dark color and rich fruit, this is instantly approachable. Tannins are well integrated into the ripe plum and black cherry fruits. With fresh acidity and a core of dry tannins at the end, the wine could age. Drink from 2016.
Sharply defined aromas of spice, chiseled mineral, dried tobacco and cassis open the bouquet of this dark, concentrated wine. There's a floral note of spicy potpourri and cinnamon stick, tight tannins and bright acidity.
Round, soft and approachable now in the California style, with ripe cherry, licorice, mocha and brown sugar flavors that last long, with a spicy finish. Defines the delicious, drink-me-now style of a young red wine.
This is a bright and perky red wine with well-defined layers of ripe fruit, spice and smoky oak. Made with the native Raboso grape, the wine shows impressive sophistication and detail. Pair with lamb or roast pork.
You'll get nutty aromas as well as honey and freshly baked bread in this fruit-forward expression of Chardonnay from northern Italy. Its texture is smooth and thick and the wine warms nicely over the palate.
The color alone sets this wine apart from its peers; it's what can only be called Barbie doll pink. Fresh and foamy, it spurts out of the bottle as if to say “Par-tay!” Fruity and flavorful, it carries hints of rose petals, citrus zest and cherry Lifesavers.
This wine's vividly layered nose blends dusty garden herbs of oregano and marjoram with hints of chile pepper, wet concrete and plum skins. The palate is supple and complex, showing dynamic spices and herbs, cut olives, savory meats and pipe smoke, much like a Middle Eastern tagine.
Offering both herbal acidity and delicious spiciness, this wine is balanced, grassy and also ripe. It is a fruity, modern style, ready to drink now.
Interesting to compare this to Rockledge's '02 Zin, with which it has little in common. This is a ruder, more rustic wine in tannins. It's extracted and jammy in red berry fruit, and dry.
A proper, textbook Pinot Noir—it's dry, nicely crisp, with smoothly astringent tannins. It has pleasant, complex cherry, pomegranate, plum, tobacco, bacon and sandalwood flavors. Not an ager, so drink up with upscale fare.
Buttery from the onset, with coconut, olive and plum making up the bouquet. The fruit is jumpy and acidic, so it dances on the palate, supported by wood and tannin. Not a lot on the finish besides vanilla and butter. Seems more tart than it should be.
This opens with black-skinned berry, clove and cooking spice aromas. The straightforward palate shows ripe black cherry, black plum and white pepper notes alongside smooth tannins. Drink soon.

Made near Panzano, in the famed “golden amphitheatre”—regarded as Chianti Classico's best vineyard site—this is a gorgeous wine with bold, opulent characteristics and deeply penetrating aromas. It exhibits beautiful saturation of color and notes of plum, prune, resin, pine and natural rubber. The structure is solid and firm and so are the polished tannins.
Vintner Ettore Righetti presents an extremely food-friendly Ripasso that boasts power and concentration, without being too heavy or chewy. Aromas here include cherry maraschino, licorice, tar and dark chocolate.
Martinborough isn't known for Sauvignon Blanc, but this is a solid example. A complex nose of melon, passion fruit, green pea and bitter green herbs turns crisp and bright in the mouth, with sweet-pea and mint flavors.
Here's a light and brilliantly crystalline Prosecco Brut with subtle aromas of mineral, white flowers and stone fruit. The easy bubbly—made by a sisters-only team—closes with a playful touch of bitter almond.
The quality of Faugères continues to be impressive, none more so than in lesser vintages. This 2002, with its fine structure, balancing tannins, fruit and acidity is dry but has layers of tarry black fruit flavors, leaving a great, fresh, lifted taste in the mouth.
Give this a few more years of cellar aging to better integrate the oak spice and toast elements that appear on the bouquet. Nebbiolo's legendary aging potential shines through with tight tannins, bright acidity and a beautiful medley of balsamic and herb aromas.
Start packing your cellar with 2010 Ribera gems like this wine, which is offering graphite and minerally plum and berry aromas in front of a full-bodied, hard-driving palate. Ripe, extracted blackberry and lightly herbal flavors finish with tons of residual weight and tannins. This is loud, burly and delicious; drink from 2016–2030.
Spice rules this pure, estate-grown Syrah, which boasts a classic nose with streaks of compost, cured meats and oolong tea. Though the stem and herb flavors are abundant, they are swaddled in ripe black  fruits and highlighted with licorice and coffee grounds from 22 months in barrel.
As always with a grand cru from Gevrey-Chambertin, this wine shows immense power. It is dominated by black fruits as well as signs of the 60% wood aging. Behind, the red cherry fruits are developing along with the lively acidity. It needs to age and should not be drunk before 2019.
This wine starts off a bit closed, but with time opens up to express attractive notes of small red berries, herbal twigs and whole baking spice. Medium weight with soft tannins and balanced acidity, this is a food-friendly wine that's sure to pair with most red meat or game dishes without overpopwering them.

This big, brawling bruiser of a red wine is a blend of Carignan, Syrah and Valdigue. It has outsized tannins, a rugged texture and enormously extracted fruit. Cherries, blackberries, black raspberries, chocolate and coffee cascade across the palate, and finish dry and spicy.
A whole universe of fresh flavors opens up: lime zest and kaffir lime leaves, green Seville orange peel and camphor. This is pure, straight-laced, unfussy and honest refreshment. As clear as a mountain spring and as bracing. That last lick of freshness will take you to a weightless citric heaven.
Supremely dense, with plum and berry jam, charred beef and molasses on the nose. The flavors go straight to blackberry, vanilla and chocolate, while the feel is full-bodied and probably a touch more tannic than desirable. Flush and even more tannic on the finish. Needs food and/or time in the cellar.
Rubbery, lightly spicy aromas of plum and berry are typical in this wine with a decent mouthfeel and oaky flavors of raspberry and plum. A dry, medicinal, lightly bitter finish reverberates with a forced oak character.
This independent company has a reputation for its aged tawnies. This 10-Year Oldis in the sweet style, but it has a fine freshness, as well as flavors of figs and firm, structured fruit at its core.
This offers a bouquet of peach and honeysuckle. It is lightly sweet, with flavors of white peach, apricot, orange rind, and honeyed herbal tea and a nice flash of lemon candy on the finish.

The pineapple, orange and vanilla flavors seem a bit thin. But it's nicely dry, with a clean burst of acidity.
This 100% Cabernet sure is oaky, but the butterscotch, toast and caramel flavors blend in seamlessly with the fruit, which is of gargantuan proportions.

Just at the beginning of a long life, it will develop in the bottle for at least 10 more years.
Smoky and lined in restrained streaks of black pepper, this is a big-boned, robust and brawny wine, girded by a foundation of tobacco and big tannin. Drink now through 2020 with gigantic slabs of braised or barbecued meat.

Drink now–2025.

This 100% varietal wine is blend of Minnick Hills (66%) and Morrison vineyards. An intriguing mix of dried herbs, poblano pepper, pink peppercorn and red fruit is kissed by barrel accents and meaty notes. The acid is bright, the feel supple and the finish extended. Drink now.

With the structure of 2007, this is a firmly textured wine, with its fruits hanging off its firm tannins. Bright acidity and black-currant flavors lend interest.
The alcohol level of nearly 16% is the star, or the villain, of the show. It gives this Zin a hot, peppery mouthfeel, not to mention going to your head. On the other hand, the wine is dry and richly flavored in wild berries and spices, and the tannic quality is very fine.
This friendly blend of Sangiovese and Syrah offers density, chewiness and succulence. Aromas include blueberry, black currant, peppercorn and anise seed and the wine offers bright, thick flavors. Pair it with meat or pasta.
A zesty, lean-boned wine, but give it credit for offering classic pepper and raspberry aromas mixed with a touch of pickle and green.

Aromatically brooding at present, it shows intricate notes of barrel spice, thyme, coffee, cranberry, black tea and red and black fruit. The palate is tightly wound, with bright acid and lightly chewy tannins that need some time in the cellar to stretch their legs. Best from 2021 to 2030.
A dark, roasted, smoky opening is the greeting on this burly Tempranillo from Zamora. Grabbing tannins pinch like squeaky rubbery, while this tastes of savory, roasted black fruits. A meaty, chewy, tannic finish is confirmation of overall toughness. Drink through 2021.
As is often the case with Rogue Valley wines, the tannins are dominant and abrasive. But flavors are good, with a mix of graphite, olive, iron filings and coffee grounds—more than pure fruit. The tannins, acids and darker flavors rule, creating a wine with rigid structure and a tight, firm finish.
Shows little on the nose, while the palate is bland and flat, with simple apple and lemon flavors. Soft and chunky white wine with some drab tropicality.
This is a first bottling of a new block in Laetitia's fine, large estate vineyard. It's a good wine, but not necessarily deserving of its own designation. Marked by crunchy acidity and tannins, it shows underlying flavors of cherries, cola and oak. Might age well, might not.
Sangiovese fruit is presented in its most genuine and clean state, with bright berry nuances, violets, moist earth, tobacco and cola. There are wood elements, but they are unobstructive, clean and otherwise relegated to a supporting role. The bouquet shows wild berry, bramble and bright acidity.
Although certainly sweet, this wine is much more than that. Alongside the honey and syrup flavors are intensely bright pineapple flavors and lively acidity. It's the balance of this wine that is so impressive, with all the elements properly in place. Drink now and until 2020.
Slightly warm and salinic on the nose, with raspberry, plum and tomato leaf aromas taking over. The palate is modest but honest, while the flavors are of sweet berry fruits with pepper on the back side. Kind of generic; sticks to the script.
Lots of fruity richness in this Pinot. Brims with ripe raspberry and cherry jam flavors, with oaky overtones of buttered cinnamon toast. The alcohol is nice and moderate. Drink over the next four years.
The cold, uneven vintage gives this rosé a green, New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc-style gooseberry aroma and flavor that makes it odd. There are some good watermelon and strawberry flavors, but it tastes unripe.
Nondescript in aroma, this soft Cabernet Franc offers pronounced tannins and a taste of red currant.
This blend of 60% Syrah, 30% Mourvèdre and 10% Grenache is ripe and jammy, with intense aromas of blackberry and raspberry preserves, baking spice, chocolate and a touch of pepper. Well balanced with a slightly creamy texture and medium tannins, the fruit dominates the palate and lingers long onto the finish. Drink now–2015.
High in alcohol, this full-bodied Syrah is almost like Port, with flavors of blackberry and blueberry jam and milk chocolate. It's pretty tannic, too. Not for everyone, but lays claim to the lush, opulent style.
Ripe aromas of cassis, prune and brandied black cherry indicate the concentration on this Cabernet. A palate that doesn't hold back is jammy but a bit heavy. Ripe berry, toast and charred flavors take on a chocolaty note on the finish. This wine is all about full extraction and big fruit. Drink through 2022.
A blend of Malvasia, Riesling and Tocai Friulano, the name of the wine means flowers of the grapes. It is a deliciously aromatic wine, spicy, perfumed, with flavors of honey and citrus. Light acidity at the end stops it being too over the top.
This has strawberry fruit with acidity and a tang of kiwi. It is warm, rounded and on the sweeter side of brut. Ready to drink.
Spicy, woody aromas of oak and root beer are equal to the black-fruit aromas this Malbec is offering. A mix of fresh acidity and creamy oak clash a bit on the palate. Flavors of herbal berry fruits and chocolate finish with rubbing tannins, a flavor note of hickory, and a hint of toasty mint.
Lightly astringent cherry and berry aromas are intriguing and complex. This eases across the palate with weight and ripeness prior to baked berry, cassis and prune flavors. Earthiness becomes a more dominant characteristic the longer this sits. Drink through 2021.
Big, rich and oily, with intense aromas of smoke and nut oil that build on the palate into flavors of peach kernel, spice and layers of minerality. A long, mouthcoating finish cinches this wine's quality. The only catch is that of 800 cases produced, only 25 are scheduled to be imported to the U.S.
The Grenache (20%) blended in shows itself with its aromas of raspberry and spice complementing Syrah's blue fruit. The flavors are full bodied and lush, pulling no punches but staying in balance.
Despite a hefty dose of Grenache (60%), this is a dark, forboding wine, loaded with earthy notes and a full, firm, somewhat stern mouthfeel. It's impressive for its concentration and clearly needs time in the bottle, but it's unclear if it will ever offer truly hedonistic drinking. Imported by International Gourmet Corp.
This opens with aromas of bread crust, citrus zest and a whiff of crushed aromatic herb. Aged on its lees in barriques, the medium-bodied palate offers toasted oak, mature yellow apple, candied lemon drop and a hint of bitter almond.
Easy and enjoyable Pinot, with real varietal character in the soft, silky texture, crispness and cherry, cola, cinnamon and vanilla flavors.
Made entirely from Dijon clones to emphasize the fruit from this site, this wine is voluptuous in style, with a backbone of caramelized apple and pear flavor. Fig and quince contribute secondary characteristics of rounded richness, as a bite of salty lime marks the finish.
Earthy aromas recalling truffle, underbrush, tilled soil and leather lead the nose. The vibrant palate shows juicy wild cherry, clove, white pepper and mineral alongside velvety tannins and firm acidity. This comes around beautifully after time in the glass so open it up ahead of time to let it breathe.
Smooth and rounded, this exhibits the opulent side of Chablis while retaining an elegant structure. It has flavors of yellow and white fruits that combine with a nutty character, a mineral texture and a refreshing, crisp finish. Age for 3–4 years.
A rich, creamy, toast- and caramel- flavored wine. There are impressive layers of complexity here from the apples and cream taste to the ripe acidity. Swathes of perfumed grapefruit and green fruits waft over this rich wine.
The five classic Bordeaux varieties find new expression in this Barossan blend. It's cherry-scented and cheerful, with hints of raspberry and vanilla to keep it interesting. With its creamy, supple tannins and mouthwatering finish, this seems likely to be best now through 2012.
Actually from the Green Valley, a firm, young, minerally wine, with a flinty tang. There's also tremendous oak influence in the form of smoke, cream and butterscotch, but the richness comes from exotic Meyer lemon, Key lime pie and green apple jam fruit. Brilliant and compelling.
Big, leathery and spicy, this wine is burly and robust on the palate, with layers of flavor. Bursts of blueberry cobbler find their way around subtle streaks of dried herb.
This sparkling wine has a smooth, creamy mousse and perfumed apple and pink-grapefruit fruitiness. Light minerality gives texture, enhanced by the bright, crisp acidity and aftertaste.
Made from Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, this has a rustic texture that frames raisin, currant and sandalwood flavors. It will pair well with beef ribs.
One of the last ‘98s to be released, and still dark in color. The tannins are hefty, although they're of the soft, pliant kind, and acidity is low. Oak overshadows the fruit. Not offering much now, and doesn't seem to be an ager.
From estate vines planted in 1993, this deeply fruity wine has a flavorful blend of banana and other tropical fruits with citrus and citrus rind highlights. Full bodied, almost fleshy for a Pinot Blanc, its mouth-cleansing acidity leaves a fresh, lemony flavor on the tongue, ready for another sip or a bit of pasta, seafood or poultry.
Le Ragnaie offers an attractively well-balanced Rosso with equal parts spice, dark fruit and tobacco on the nose. In the mouth, this wine is full of dimension and power and its rich berry flavors last a long time.
From one of the most celebrated vineyards in Barbaresco, this structured wine offers aromas of mature black fruit accented with whiffs of balsamic herbs and new leather. The palate delivers crushed black cherry and rasberry layered with notes of black pepper, licorice and menthol alongside assertive tannins. It needs time to unfold and develop. Drink 2016–2026.
The top cuvée from Château Famaey is a rich, new-wood-aged wine. With spice, mint and toast flavors, it's opulent, ripe and full of black fruits. Even at five years, it's still young, with tannins that are dense and concentrated. Drink from 2016.
This is an attractive, soft blend of Arinto, Viosinho and Antão Vaz. With white fruit flavors and a warm, ripe texture, it's crisp, fruity and ready to drink.
Underbrush, camphor, balsamic notes, game, French oak and oak-driven spice lead the nose. The tight, firmly structured palate shows oak, mature plum, baked fruit and a hint of vanilla alongside assertive, grainy tannin that dry out the finish.

Here's a sweet, simple Cabernet, offering black cherry, chocolate and spice flavors. Drink now.
From a six-acre site further inland than many of the producer's other sources, this wine shines in classic coastal expression nonetheless. It presents a mix of earthy, stemmy forest and black tea, with a touch of reduction and lightness of oak and power. Delicately textured, it delivers a refined style.
This deep red-violet colored Bordeaux-style blend offers a bouquet of elderberry and black currant. Strong tannins stay in the forefront amidst cooked fruit flavors of elderberry, cassis and blueberry with hints of mint and anisette that linger into the cool, syrupy finish.
Tropical fruits and a mix of grass and green herbs make for a nice bouquet. The palate on this Casablanca wine is juicy and round, not pointy, with citrus and nectarine flavors. Finishes with green apple tang; definitely gets the job done.
Citrus and green pear combine with yeasty notes to give an impression of subdued but creamy fruitiness. It's an easy-drinking, savory and versatile white, with some peppery spice.

From the Buonconvento area of Tuscany, this is an oak-aged red wine with aromas of red cherry, toasted almond and cola. It offers an immediate and vertical delivery of aroma and refreshing crispness in the mouth.
This bottling from Guigal's own Hermitage holdings is incredibly rich and ripe (15.5% alcohol). In fact, it comes dangerously close to being overblown before the syrupy cherry fruit is reined back in by underlying spice and minerality. Expect that minerally edge to assert itself more with time in the cellar, making this a wine worth revisiting in 10 years' time.
A mineral-driven wine with typical herbaceous flavors, some pineapple and peach fruit and a tangy, lemon-zest aftertaste. It's crisp and fresh, ready to drink now and over the next 2–3 years.
A soft but spicy nose starts this flavorful sip from Thorntree. Open, fresh and friendly on the palate, the wine has a simple but elegant character. Pair with poultry, grilled seafood or enjoy every day on its own.

Whispers of smoke and fresh herb are a counterpoint to the heady notes of white flower, sweet peach and melon on this gorgeous Bordeaux-style. It's elegantly composed, with a rich, creamy texture, a bristle of acidity and a crushed-stone minerality. This is undeniably a top pick from Long Island.
Two talented winemakers, Sandra Tavares da Silva and Jorge Serôdio Borges, jointly produce wines under the Wine & Soul label. This vintage of Pintas, black as ink, is richly spicy, with peppered fig and raisins over a dense core of dusty tannins. It is seriously powerful, but bears its weight well.
Two bottles were tasted; the first sour and disjointed, the second, considerably better, with tart lemon and green apple fruit and some pretty orange-peel highlights. It's finished with a screwcap so a bad cork is not an issue, but watch out for bottle variation.
A bit raisiny, with some bitter raisinskin tannins, but despite some unevenness, it's a dry red wine suitable for everyday purposes. Offers full-bodied flavors of blackberries, currants and cola.
A quite remarkable mauve-pink in color, this offers faint cherry aromas. It's nearly sweet on the palate, with strawberries and hard red berry candy flavors.
Considered warm by Central Coast standards, Paso Robles is not always ideal for Chardonnay, but the veteran squad at Castoro did well on this nicely tight bottling. Key-lime pith and crisp Gala apple show on the nose, while solid acidity delivers flavors of rainy slate and squeezed citrus. There's good grippy tension to the sip as well.
Briny and dark copper-orange in color, this is a weighty wine, though the alcohol level is low. The tannins and leathery texture of the Syrah shine through, checked by tangy citrus and a hit of white pepper.
This is quite light, with a leafy character and barely ripe fruit flavors that hint at tomato paste. Some pineapple and vanilla flavors come in, making this a rather odd, though still interesting, budget bottle.
Toasted nuts and mature peach are, unfortunately, matched by hints of sulfur and cardboard box. The mouthfeel is good with creamy texture and medium acidity.
Very tart and acidic, this is a wine that cries out for oysters. The lemony fruit is highlighted with notes of ginger, celery and a broad mineral streak. Nice complexity for such a low-alcohol (12.4%), high-acid bottle.
The Scrapper is aptly named, packing plenty of flavorful punches into a structured but softly tannic wine. Peppery, especially in aroma, it offers full-bodied leathery black cherry fruit and concentrated layers of savory chocolate. It's delicious and would make a fine pairing with any steak.
Here's a gorgeous wine with a deep, inky color and super extraction that is elegant but powerful at the same time. This is a balanced wine, but it's also an intense wine, with loads of ripe fruit, spice and tobacco. It feels smooth and rich, with a finely crafted texture that is velvety and supple.
Quite sweet, but ultimately a bit simple, this partially botrytized Chardonnay clocks in at 12% residual sugar. A fleeting whiff of volatile acidity might bother sensitive tasters, but there's also plenty of ripe pineapple and dried apricot flavors. Imported by DC Imports LLC.
A nose of peach, spice and citrus notes leads this light and lively white made from Roditis and Sauvignon Blanc. Lean but likeable, it offers a lemon overtone on the palate and a fresh, spicy finish. Pair it with grilled seafood, Thai dishes or cold chicken salads.
This is a jammy, mature Amarone that imparts aromas of berry preserves, blackberry tart and sun-ripened strawberries. The wine is sweet and chewy in texture and offers bright berry flavors and sticky tannins.
Full-bodied, plush and ripe, this is a bit of a throwback style of Chardonnay, marrying peach, vanilla and mango notes into a delectable whole. Toasted oak gives a bit of structure without straitjacketing the luscious fruit. Drink now–2018.
Hogue's Reserve Cabernet is tight and nicely structured, with aromas of black fruits, barrel toast and tar. It's tough and chewy, herbal and tight, and should be decanted so it can stretch out a bit before being drunk. With the extra airtime you'll get more black cherry, currant and smoke, and the green tannins subside.
A soft wine that has easy but attractively ripe fruit. This is not a wine for aging, but in 2003, the estate has made a very drinkable wine. Patache stands for an ancient coaching inn, recollected on the wine's label by a coach and horses. Imported by Grands Chais de France.
This pricey, low production Cab hails from the lower slopes of Spring Mountain, and shares that region's terroir in the hard, firm tannins and stony minerality that undergirds the cassis, cherry and cedar flavors. Very fine in structure, polished and focused, it will blossom this year, and age well for many more.
A single-vineyard Sangiovese made Chianti-style, meaning it's dry as dust with pronounced acidity. Pretty rich in flavor, though, with a ripe streak of cherries and sweet chocolate. Dry, dusty tannins kick in in the finish.
Rick Longoria's light winemaking touch even plays into this Spanish grape, which is daintier than regional counterparts. Red and Bing cherries mix with purple flowers, some dried fruit and vanilla paste on the nose. The palate leans herbal, with anise and chopped Italian herbs, also showing brick minerality and oak on the finish. The wine would definitely shine brighter with food.
A pleasing blend of black cherry, chocolate and herb flavors, all couched in powdery tannins that should smooth out nicely in the cellar. This moderate-bodied Merlot is good for drinking now, too. Finishes clean.
Lemon in color, with pronounced floral aromas—elder-flower, honeysuckle and acacia—alongside white peaches and nectarines. There's a strong mineral focus on the nose. Sweet, yet deliciously crisp and juicy, with ample flavor concentration. Taut and lively, and has a long minerally finish.
At first a bit sharp and volatile, this has both substantial residual sugar (50 g/L) and significant alcohol for a late harvest wine. It's spicy and lightly honeyed, and opens nicely into a mix of candied pear and pineapple fruit, with streaks of vanilla running through.
Buttercream, sea salt, caramel and lemon candy aromas show on the nose of this solid bottling. The flavors are full but not overly ripe, with yellow apple, poached pear, white peach and a sea salt character that keeps it mouthwatering.
Tantara's 2012 Pinots tend to be cloudy and light like this one, which delivers aromas of cranberry and allspice. It's very soft on the palate, with light chai flavors and the tartness of barely ripe pomegranate.
Overtly sweet, with orange and vanilla flavors, and lively acidity. This would be a lovely wine to sip on a summer day, or with fresh fruit.
This low-alcohol, off-dry wine offers tart citrus and apple fruit. Light cinnamon accents and significant acidity somewhat offset the 22g/L of residual sugar.
Black cherry, mocha and cola on the nose, followed by a balanced, bright array of red and black berries give this wine a fun, easy-drinking character. Good overall structure and length, with a smoky finish. The wine is a great everyday red choice.
Made entirely from Nebbiolo, Italy's most noble grape, this offers a fragrance of McIntosh apple, grapefruit and yellow peach. The palate displays an enticing depth of flavors including red cherry, strawberry and notes of cinnamon-spice alongside a refined and persistent perlage.
An impressive Cabernet, but one in need of cellaring. The primary fruit flavors of blackberries and blueberries are delicious, as is the fancy coating of smoky oak. And the tannins are rich and sweetly ripe. Give it until 2016 or 2017 to begin to integrate.
Shows slightly sweet flavors of pineapple marmalade, green apple tart, honeysuckle and buttered toast, fortunately balanced with crisp, citrusy acidity. It was made from grapes grown in the Los Alamos region of Santa Barbara County.
The blend is 50-50 Viognier and Roussanne, sourced from Gamache Vineyards. Scents and flavors suggest orange candy, with a slightly grainy, baby aspirin quality. Lemony and forward; a good quaffer.
Aromas of fresh herbs, kiwi and pineapple are followed by off-dry tropical-fruit flavors that trail toward the finish.
Offers toast, cream and yellow fruit on the nose and similar banana cream, toast and yellow peach flavors on the palate. Aged in French oak, with 50% malolactic fermentation; strikes the right balance between oak and fruit.
Shows deep, concentrated flavors of blackberries and black currants, with classically fine, complex Napa tannins. It's 100% Cabernet, with 50% new oak, and although the label doesn't say so, the grapes come from a Howell Mountain vineyard. Beautiful now, and will develop over the next 6–8 years. Decant for hours if you open it now.
Attractive red fruits dominate this light and fruity wine. Good acidity and bright flavors are smoothed by wood, while the aftertaste brings back the fruit. Drink now.
This limited, two-barrel release from Jaxon makes a strong case for the quality of Southern Oregon Malbec. It's dark to the point of black, and the flavors continue to emphasize black cherry fruit, along with dark chocolate, roasted coffee and clean earth. Tannic and chewy, it is a solid choice for anything grilled.
A well-built red, this features a tasty core of plum and raspberry flavors surrounded by appealing, slightly sweet oak accents that come out as vanilla and cinnamon. Perhaps it's not tight or tannic enough for everyone, but it should be a crowd pleaser.
This fabulous Cabernet has been blended with Merlot, Cab Franc and Petit Verdot. It's incredibly complex in both flavor and structure, offering waves of blackberries and cherries, currants, dark chocolate and toast that go on and on into a long, spicy finish. The grapes come from various sources, including St. Helena and Atlas Peak, showing winemaker Tom Hinde's mastery of the art of blending.
A beautifully perfumed wine. It shows an elegant side to Cahors, offering intense and juicy blackberry fruit that override the dark tannins. The wine has weight and power and remains finely proportioned. Age for 4–5 years.
Since last reviewed in 2008, the Alloro Vineyard's grapes seem to have gained in complexity and sophistication. Elegant and fine tuned, this new release combines scents and accents of rose petals, wet rock and raspberries with generous, supporting acidity. The finish extends gracefully with the finesse of Premier Cru Burgundy.
Good fruit, s  with plenty of soft cranberry/cherry flavor, and very light milk chocolate in the finish.
Here is a lean and more compact Fiano from Puglia that offers drying mineral and some yellow fruit. Overall, the wine is neutral and the impression it leaves on the palate is short and simple.
So rich, so opulent, this is fantastic to enjoy now. It really nails it, with intricate flavors of buttered toast, butterscotch, honey and vanilla that ride high on top of the pineapple and tropical fruit flavors. The winery is best known for Cabernet Sauvignon, but with this release, it's competing at the highest level of quality Chardonnay.
Despite some floral notes, this tight, dry wine is all structure. Its power comes from the dry center, showing intense acidity. Very dry, firm and hard-edged.
Extremely tight, clean and minerally aromas of chalk, citrus pith and lemongrass make for a very crisp and fresh nose on this white wine bottling of the typically red Grenache grape. The palate is just as zesty, with apple skin, green papaya and underripe mango flavors, showing flashes of tropicality while remaining light and tight.
Made from 65% Sangiovese and 35% Cabernet Sauvignon—organically farmed—this polished red opens with aromas of black-skinned fruit, violet and Mediterranean herb. On the full-bodied palate, tobacco and aniseed accent a core of ripe black cherry, while firm tannins provide support.
This wine has pleasing richness, lending warmth across a full palate. Forward berry and cherry flavors fill the mouth, offering an accessible burst of fresh flavor in a somewhat blocky frame. There's a jolt of spice and a streak of cola, all quite tasty. The wine spent 19 months in 53% new French oak.
Tastes hot as a chile pepper, and no wonder. The alcohol is 15.8%. Some red wines get away with it, but this one doesn't. The berry-cherry flavors are baked, and the wine is clumsy and inelegant.
Light straw in the glass, this wine has aromas of pineapple and lemon zest. Refreshing on the palate, it offers flavors of clementine, lemon, orange rind, and honeysuckle. The finish features a lasting sense of brightness.
Funky and intriguing on the nose, this proffers scents of narcissus and farmyard, with touches of char and dark fruit. Medium bodied, this has an open texture, with integrated acids and malleable tannins. Flavors of tart blackberry candy, leather and Dr. Pepper surface on the palate.
Made from a blend of Corvina, Syrah and Oseleta, this savory wine is made by one of Amarone's leading producers. It offers red currant, bell pepper and black pepper flavors. It's tightly wound but fresh, and would pair nicely with grilled portobello mushrooms.
Cherry and berry aromas are earthy, ripe and blocky. This feels round, complete and easy to drink. Flavors of loamy berry and black plum finish dusty and earthy, with just enough acidity to create length and modest complexity. This is 60% Garnacha and 40% Tempranillo.
The real deal in a cool-climate Syrah. Dark and broodingly dry, it smells like grilled lamb, roasted rosemary, white pepper and other Provençal herbs, blackberries, cassis and smoky oak. High in alcohol but balanced, this 100% varietal wine is huge, powerful, dramatic and tannic. Drink it soon with the best grilled meats.
This tangy white shows true Mosel character with scents of wet stone, apricot and lime in a delicate, energetic frame. It's crisp and slightly sweet but refreshing throughout. Drink now to 2012.
Even in inland Alentejo, the Portuguese think of the ocean and of seafaring. This smooth, fruity wine, with its soft tannins and touch of spice, is ready to drink. With a round texture, rich berry fruits and balanced acidity, it is a fine, fruity wine for now.
Both a study of clone and stainless-steel processing, this wine offers fresh-cut pineapple, ripe Gala apple, honeydew and even peach, with a citrus-skin sharpness to the nose. The flavors are delicate and familiar but complex and deep, with Anjou pears, lemon-lime soda and apple flesh. It's a lively stainless expression.
This companion wine to the famous Harlan Estate comes from the same Oakville vineyard. Decadent and vastly complex, it opens with cassis, grilled meat, cedar, spicebox, cigar box and cheddar aromas, and then turns medium- to full-bodied in the mouth. Terrific black cherry, blackberry and cassis fruit, pure and refined. Perfect elaboration of oak, char, tannins, acids and fruit, like a symphony orchestra working together. Drink now through 2015.
With a touch of initial mineral austerity, this still-young wine offers tannins and a solid structure as well as black cherry and dark plum fruits. Beautifully balanced, it will develop slowly, leaving its minerality and rounding out.
A beautifully rich and rewarding expression of tropical fruit and creamy texture, this estate white spends nine months in large French oak casks and is selected from the best lots. Supporting acidity keeps it refreshing in waves of lime and grapefruit.

Boasting cherry-vanilla cola and ripe fruit notes, this is a young, fresh wine that shows hints of savory tones on the palate. Drink now.
A good, solid, slightly rustic Cab, with cassis and sage flavors that are wrapped into dry, slightly green tannins. Fine now, but doesn't have the stuffing for the long haul. Drink now–2010.
Past vintages of Moccagatta's Basarin Barbaresco have been stellar, but this bottling still needs time to find its feet. The fruit is youthful and raw; the tannins are tight and astringent. Give this wine 8–10 years to evolve.
Menthol and savory herbs juxtapose rich black cherry and berry flavors in this off-dry Dornfelder. It's simple in style but enjoyable now for its juicy, fresh black fruit character.
There's a sense of familiarity in the scent of lemon candy that wafts from this slightly off-dry Riesling. Medium-bodied in style, it's juicy on the palate with ripe melon and peach flavors accented with tangerine acidity. Delicate hints of tea leaf and lemon zest add nuance. Drink now for it's youthful exuberance.
This bright Sauvignon offers an aromatic medley of stone fruit, papaya, dried hay and fragrant yellow rose. The wine has good structure and a polished, clean finish that would work with fried finger foods or mozzarella bites.
Manfred Prüm looks to have followed up his amazing 2005s with 2006s that come close in quality. The 2006 WS spätlese shows a certain reserved minerality on the nose, but opens up into a gorgeously layered palate of apple, vanilla and citrus flavors. It's medium-bodied but zesty and fresh at the same that it's creamy and rich. And there's plenty of concentration and length on the finish.
After a lack of international success with Merlot and Cabernet, Syrah is being touted as the next hot red from Hawkes Bay. From a top-notch vintage, this wine offers scents of tar, prune and white pepper, then flavors of blackberry, prune and pepper. Finishes with crisp acids and soft tannins.
Here's a super-modern, piacione (roughly translated from the Italian as “no one can resist it”) wine with deep layers of vanilla, toast, roasted espresso bean, blackberry, balsam notes, smoke, spice and tar. The wine is thick and soft in the mouth and almost ready to drink now (or in five years). The finish is delicious with a long cherry-flavored fade.
Continuing in a tart and juicy vein, as in previous years, this boasts a concentrated and immaculate palate layered with citrus, peach and melon. The abundant fruit is perfectly supported by mouth-puckering (in a good way) natural acidity.
Sweet, jammy berry aromas are a nice opening. The wine is tight in the mouth, with smacking tannins that draw down red berry and herbal flavors. For the most part this is a complete, standard type of Rioja with juiciness and crisp acidity.
Savory tones of dusty mineral and smoked nuts persist from nose to finish on this slightly off-dry Riesling. Pressed apple and pear flavors on the palate are crisp, finishing with lingering earthiness. Drink now through 2019.
Ripe, almost overripe, with pie-filling flavors of cherries and blackberries that veer past currants into suggestions of raisins. Feels fat, opulent, rich, heavy, and that impression is compounded by lots of toasty, sweet oak. Dramatic, but lacks subtlety and control. May develop in the bottle over the next 4–6 years.
Dark concentration and an inky, midnight color describe this Amarone's rich appearance. On the nose, however, it offers vibrant and lively tones of cola, mineral, cherry and dried flowers. There's even a soapy, or perfumed incense-like tone hidden at the back.
Aromas of violet, underbrush and baking spice lead the way. The savory palate doles out black cherry, clove and white pepper set against firm tannins and lively acidity. Enjoy soon.
This interesting, complex wine moves from tangy candied citrus to baking spices and long concentrated flavors of dried plum, apricot and more. Think Christmas fruitcake with a touch of leather and you're there.
A hint of rose petal perfumes white peach and grapefruit on this elegant off-dry Riesling. The midpalate is softened by a burst of luscious apricot, while a zesty steak of lime balances a long, meandering finish.
This is a lovely wine that very much lives up to the power and thickness associated with Barolo from the Serralunga d'Alba subzone. It opens with big, sweet tones of mature fruit, vanilla spice, dark cola and toasted hazelnut. It feels wonderful in the mouth as well, thanks to the softness and richness of its texture.
A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (70%) and Syrah, brooding aromas of ground stone, herb, brown stem and black fruit give way to dense layered blackberry flavors. It shows great focus, poise, texture and exquisite length. Best from 2021 to 2027.
This delicious and affordable wine offers a fragrance of blue flower, tilled soil, game and leather, along with whiffs of mature black fruit. The juicy palate delivers ripe blackberry, black cherry, black pepper and licorice alongside firm but refined tannins.
Mellow earthy aromas of mossy black fruits, vanilla and licorice feed into a smooth palate with moderate depth and layering. Blackened flavors of coffee and dark chocolate accent black-fruit and mushroom notes, while this finishes with prune, pepper and toasty flavors along with a glassy feel. Drink through 2019.
A fine Pinot Noir that needs some time to come around. Right now, the oak and fruit haven't come together, giving a butterscotch edge to the cherries. But it's dry, moderate in alcohol and crisp, and just needs a few years to develop. 2010–2013.
The 2010 Meredith Mitchell designate is less ripe and more acidic than the richly flavored 2009. It carries a whiff of volatility that grows more noticeable after being open for 24 hours. Its modest cherry fruit is set against balanced tannins.
This is delicious, as Longoria's wines tend to be. It's dry and full bodied, and shows the firm tannins of a cool-climate Syrah. Yet it's also jam packed with blackberry, cassis, anise and dark chocolate richness. Really nice now, especially a great steak with some mushroomy additions.
Lighter framed, and a touch on the traditional side in terms of its lean color and subdued aromas of dried fruits and herbs. In the mouth, cherry, beet and chocolate mix nicely, while it finishes fairly large and expansive. Still firm and needing a few years of cellar time. The blend is Sangiovese, Cabernet and Merlot.
While this Grüner does not give away too much on its rather closed nose, the savory hints of pepper, arugula, pear and thyme unite beautifully and insistingly on the midpalate. The wine gets full marks for refreshing, authentic typicity.
Light fruit, muddled aromas, candied flavors and a heavy aftertaste don't really add up to a lot. Yes, it's acceptable. But it's also aging quickly and won't be improving.
Dark-skinned berry, forest floor, pipe tobacco, new leather and balsamic notes float out of the glass. On the elegantly structured palate, taut, polished tannins and vibrant acidity frame ripe red cherry, exotic spice and aromatic herb flavors. A lingering star anise note announces the close. Impeccably balanced and loaded with class, it's still young and needs time to fully develop. Drink 2022–2037.
Aromas of green apple, tuberose and a whiff of bread crust meld together on this vibrant white. The palate offers honeydew melon, white peach, bread crust and tangerine while tangy acidity gives it a crisp finish.
This is the producer's inaugural offering of the variety, made in tiny amounts, but boy oh boy, it's good. Bright blue and black-berry succulence exude vibrancy and freshness on the palate complemented by savory hints of tar, black licorice and char. Velvety soft tannins allow the fruit to speak.
A blend of Chardonnay (60%) and Viognier, this is lightly reductive out of the gate, along with aromas of Band Aid and apple. It drinks a hair off dry, with melon and apple flavors.
Complex and precise, this lovely Cabernet—blended with 10% Merlot and 3% Malbec—layers cassis, herb, bark, earth and graphite elements within a cigar box coating. Those streaks of tobacco are wedded to a touch of espresso as it weaves through a lingering finish.
Bone dry, acidic and subtle in citrus and tropical fruit flavors, this is a Chardonnay that doesn't insist on standing on its own. Instead, it's perfectly content to let the food star, remaining in a supporting role. For pairings, lobster risotto comes to mind, or just a delicious mayonnaise-based sandwich.
With chocolate as well as fruit flavors, this is a structured wine. A bitter edge gives the juicy damson fruit a jolt. However, it should develop well to give a ripely textured wine from 2016.
This medium-bodied wine is a great value and strikes a good balance between pure fruitiness and more complexity. It has friendly cherry and berry aromas and fairly rich flavors. A smooth, lightly tannic texture adds the right bite.
Starts with leather, cedar and chocolate, then adds in plenty of cherry-berry fruit and some herbal notes. It's full bodied and richly textured, with a long, lush finish that just lacks a little nuance. Drink now–2018.
Would you believe Cabernet Franc, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay and French Columbard in a dry rose wine? It's good, too, with rich berry-cherry flavors and some real depth and complexity. Particularly nice is the long finish, which continues the spicy,  fruity flavors. Drink very cold.
This is a soft, lush Chardonnay, with ripe, jammy apricot, orange, mango and honey flavors, accented with buttered toast and vanilla. It's a satisfying Chardonnay at one of the better prices out there.
This structured wine is firm at this early stage, with tannins and a touch of bitter-chocolate extraction that needs to diminish before the black fruits get their chance. Keep this dark, solid wine until 2022.
The nose of this wine is brimming with dark fruit, spice and toasted-oak fragrances. The palate shows oaky notes of coffee and toast, with soft plum and pepper undertones. It's straightforward, with a drying, tannic finish.
Heavy and yellow, with oxidized aromas of papaya and melon. The wine has acidity but it isn't creating any vibrancy; instead, the wine is chunky, clumsy and tastes of banana and lemon. Acceptable but not really cutting it.
Shows fine Siduri character, a silky, dry wine with pleasant Pinot Noir flavors of cherries, currants, mocha and cola. Doesn't have the weight or density of the winery's single-vineyard wines, but the price is right.
Just 8% of this reserve spent time in new oak, putting the emphasis on juicy jammy flavors of cranberry fruit. It rolls into sour cherry, some citrus and a most refreshing, clean and vivid mouthfeel. Drink now and into the mid-2020s.
Loaded with fruit—apricot, pineapple and passion fruit—this is an attractive, medium-bodied Pinot Gris with just a hint of sweetness. Enjoy it over the next year.

A blend of Arinto and perfumed Verdelho, the wine is ripe with yellow fruits and pear. It has spice and a clean, clear texture that is immediately attractive and drinkable. The wine is ready to drink.
Steely, minerally and very textured, this has concentratio and taut layer of acidity to go with the lime fruit. Powered by its structure, it will age for 3–4 years.
Merlot makes up nearly two-thirds of this blend with the balance Cabernet Franc. Brooding dried herb, cocoa and dark fruit aromas lead to rich but well-balanced black-fruit flavors backed by a firm core of tannins.
The dainty bouquet of this Grenache-based rosé leads with aromas of white flower, red cherry and firm peach. There's a pleasant tartness to the palate, with flavors of red currant and rhubarb that finish bright and refreshing.
A blend of 57% Merlot, 26% Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc all come from Alder Ridge Vineyard, shows notes of milk chocolate, cherry, herbs and tire rubber. It's lighter in style with a slightly gritty feel to the tannins.
Unabashedly buttery and oaky in aroma and flavor, this first-class, full-bodied wine has a mouth-filling, creamy texture that lingers long into the finish. It starts with buttered toast and almond aromas and opens into a rich pear-and-hazelnut palate, its flavors unfolding in nuanced layers.
This rosé, made from Pinot Noir and Syrah, is brilliant pink in color, with aromas of strawberry and cream. The silky palate shows pronounced red cherry and vanilla flavors.
Intensity is the keyword here: the butter, toast and ripe yellow fruits are both ripe and powerful. There's some spice, balanced with acidity, finishing so fresh, young and crisp.
Slightly grassy on the nose, along with hints of lime and green bean. On the palate, it's light in body, offering only watery green bean flavors.

It shows a pleasing sense of restraint, accenting the Syrah's suppleness with an elegant styling that keeps the attention high.
Good example of cool Central Coast Pinot, with its polished, jammy flavors of cherry and raspberry and dusty spices, complexed with smoky oak. Bright acidity and gentle tannins make for an easy drink. Light, but a pretty good value.
This is a dry red wine exuding bell pepper and oak that was made in large quantities in partnership with musician Dave Matthews.
Kevin Riley likes to toss in lots of little bits into his blends, and this one features 11 different grape varieties. Baked strawberries and red plums show on the nose, along with dewy herbs, crushed gravel, dried oregano, basil and smoke. Light red fruit is present on the palate, along with caramel and vanilla. It's a fresh and lively wine, if not super complex.
There's an herbaceous streak to this wine but it's more than compensated for by black-cherry fruit and exciting smoked meat aromas that kept me going back for another sniff. Supple and ready to drink now and over the next few years.
The wine is packed with fruit: blackberry and damson flavors that are given a great lift by the acidity. It has a spicy side to it, adding complexity and filling out the tannins. Drink this wine from 2018.
Herbal flavors descend into stemminess, with the aggressive tannins swamping the fruit. The finish is hard, earthy and tasting of green tea.
After struggling with this vineyard for a number of years, Joe Benziger seems to have gotten a handle on this finicky mountain fruit. Even in this so-so vintage, the wine is complex and pleasurable, although tannic. Hold until 2008.
Although the wine is dry, it has a delicate softness that gives a broad spice and fruit character. The acidity is already well integrated into the ripe texture. It's not a wine for aging, but for drinking now as an apéritif.
A pure expression of Cabernet Sauvignon from the volcanic soils of Mt. Etna, this shows a drying mineral nuance of brimstone and graphite, backed by black fruit and spice notes. The tannins are superpolished and silky. This is a beautiful marriage of grape variety and terroir.
Vanilla cookies and sulfuric match stick are about all you can draw from the bouquet. This is flat in feel, with candied, flabby flavors of green fruits. The finish is bland.
Super-fruity, with jammy flavors of pineapples, green apples, peaches and spicy golden mango. A bit sugary sweet, too.

This big but balanced wine has melon and apple aromas, lots of fruit and toasty oak in the flavors, and a super-smooth and rich texture. The finish lingers.
This is an impressively complex Vinho Verde, obviously made for food. With its tangy acidity and tense mineral texture, this blend of a range of the regional grapes is structured and with a delicious, refreshing aftertaste. Drink now.
The deep color matches the bold grapy flavors. With a touch of sweetness, soft texture and syrupy balance, this will chase down a spicy burrito or kung pao chicken.
Overripe flavors of raisins and prunes mar this Cabernet Sauvignon, despite the fact that the vintage was so cool. The wine is marked by the soft tannins and herbaceousness that you often find in an Alexander Valley Cabernet. Not ageable, so drink up.
Shows stalky hay on the nose along with apple and lemon drop. The palate is crisp, focused and elegant, with driving acidity and bright flavors of apple, lemon and nectarine. As a barrel fermented wine, it's lightly woody as it finishes long and strong. 90% Viura with Malvasia.
A very bright, tropical Sémillon from Amador-based Andis. Winemaker Mark McKenna uses 35-year-old vines to make this layered, slightly sweet but completely in balance wine. Enjoyable lychee, just-ripe pineapple and fig permeate; the wine gets even better as it opens.
A touch of honeycomb swings alongside ripe pear and peach notes, creating a very inviting appetizing nose. The palate emphasizes this juiciness even more with the slightest touch of residual sweetness and a flowing fluid palate that only shows its concentration towards the end.

This pretty Satèn (a sparkling expression of Chardonnay) offers creamy notes of vanilla, yellow rose, custard and toasted nut. Those bright citrusy notes often associated with the variety shine through on the close.
The En Cerise is all Syrah; very dark, young and toasty. It already shows streaks of smoke, pepper, grilled meat, cassis and pomegranate. There's baby fat—bacon, wood spice—but terroir behind it. Herbs, grainy fruit, nuances of grain and herb and wood and earth, all very clean.
It's hard to find a favorite within Dr. Loosen's excellent line up of 2015 auslese, but this bottling stands out for its kaleidoscope of fruit, floral and earthen complexities. Sumptuous and ripe, fleshy white peach and grapefruit flavors undulate on the palate. It's finely framed, edged by sharp lines of slate, spine-tingling acidity and swathes of fennel and earth. The finish feels fragile, laced in sweetness and lingering.
The wine is all fruitiness, with attractive acidity and almond and lemon flavors. Made to be drunk instantly, it has the lightest texture, white fruit flavors and a fresh, crisp aftertaste.

Dark chocolate, black cherry and a hint of raspberry fill the nose and palate, with secondary floral hints. This blend of Blaufränkisch and Merlot is slender but muscular, with immense structure, ripe tannin and en edge of iron-oxide. It has the graceful but strong physique of a male ballet dancer. Drink 2016–2020.
Consistent from vintage to vintage, Three Rivers makes their Chardonnay in a soft, buttery, palate-pleasing style, showing round fruit flavors spiced up with citrus highlights. A very good value.

A gentle lift of crushed black cherry rises from the glass. There also is an edge of medicinal herb. The body is light and juicy, fresh and highly aromatic.

Concentrated lilac and violet flowers paint a pretty picture to the beef char and creosote darkness on the nose of this bottling from a Los Olives vineyard. The palate blends boysenberry, blackberry, coffee and bittersweet dark chocolate, loaded atop a very firm structure.
Powerful but reduced, with gritty berry aromas and a ton of clove on the nose. There's a carry over of the clove in the mouth, and also roasted fruit flavors, wood spice and sweetness. Powerful for sure, but arguably a bit too woody for its own good.
Light aromas offer notes of apple and pear. The palate of thhis wine is cleanly made, showing no obvious new-oak impact. It's a straight-down-the-fairway interpretation of this variety.
Lemon mousse, pear and peach notes open the nose of this fresh Greco di Tufo. There is a drying mineral tone at the back that holds the wine together nicely.

A thin peach nose is the initial impression, followed by good balance on the palate and a decent mouthfeel. Then comes the finish, however, where we detect signs of early oxidation

This is Baron-Fuenté's top wine, made as an expression of pure Chardonnay. It is tight, textured and ready for some bottle aging. The minerality is palpable with its zingy edge and lemon-zest flavors. While the wine can be drunk now, it will be much more complex in a few months. Drink from 2017.
Big, fat and very soft, this wood-aged wine shows just hints of minerality underneath rich creaminess. The acidity, though, is missing, the white fruits overripe.

This expression of Perricone (a little-known grape from Sicily) is weighed down by aromas of Band Aid, dried rose petal and old spice that distract from the variety's natural fruit flavors. The wine appears old and past its prime.
In this vintage, this historic wine shows a different personality with its ripe aromas of blackberry and raspberry jam. It opens with notes of spice, tobacco and black pepper.
For Chilean Cab, this is forced and rocky. The nose is mulchy and sour, with coffee grinds, herbal notes and heavy turned earth. The palate is tannic and biting, with herbal berry flavors and a woody cover. Meaty on the finish but hard in texture. This is not a friendly wine.
Easy drinking Zin, with good flavors of wild berries and spices wrapped in a creamy texture. Even though the wine is fully dry, it has a softness, almost a butteriness, that is almost sweet. Turns real long on the finish, with a ripe fruitiness that lasts.

Here the blend is two thirds Cabernet Sauvignon, the rest an even split between Cab Franc and Merlot. Straightforward and unadorned, this wine is tightly defined, with sleek and juicy red fruit flavors.

This is a cheerful, concentrated white, stainless-steel fermented, that's floral and nutty on the nose. Thick and rich on the palate, it dances in lemon essence and tropical pineapple. An additional 8% Sémillon is blended in.
Big and rich in the mouth, with gorgeous, velvety tannins. Offers a juicy plum and cassis core, with oak, tobacco and earth accents, and a char and cocoa notes on the back end. As compelling as the flavors are, it'll be the mouthfeel that wins you over (this is one of those Cabs that could taste like eggs Benedict and still be delicious—its mouthfeel is that good).
Toast, oak and sage aromas follow through to the lean palate along with espresso, dried cherry and a note reminiscent of buttered popcorn. It's tightly wound, with aggressive tannins that leave a bracing finish. Give the tannins a few years to soften then drink soon.
A common wine, slightly sweet and simple in construction, showing jammy flavors of raspberries and cherries. Finishes somewhat bitter, with green tannins.
Lagarde regularly makes consistent, true wines and this Cab is compact, solid and smooth, with spice and a lot of berry fruit on the nose. Refined, deep and pure on the palate, with blackberry, marzipan and licorice flavors. Very nice Argentine Cabernet for the money. Drink now into 2011.
Upon first pour, this only shows some earthy hints of evolution. With air, the aromas awaken and lovely notes hayflower notes emerge. The palate is laced with elderberry and dried oak leaf flavors and framed by smooth tannins. Just a little bottle age has given this an almost timeless elegance, proving a wine doesn't need power to shine, just depth. Drink now–2025.
This is a really luscious wine—100% varietal—with unusual richness. The flavors are dense and detailed, a mix of sweet grain, clover and beeswax along with lychee, pear, white peach and pink grapefruit. Smooth and full-bodied, it keeps on going through a lingering, lightly honeyed finish. The label is a colorful drawing of a blonde angel surrounded by stars.
Naggiar makes at least 15 wines from its estate vineyard, and really hit a home run with this classic that should have a long life ahead of it. The color is dark and intense right to the rim, while aromas blend a subtle spiciness with bold and complex fruit notes. Flavors convey concentrated dark chocolate, black cherry and espresso. It's enjoyable now with big proteins, but will be best after 2020.
Apricots and honey mark this wine. It is just off dry, just hinting at sweetness, more to do with soft perfumed fruit. It's a great apéritif style with its fruity character. Drink now.
Savory notes of herb and pine join the scent of ripe yellow plum with the faintest echo of passion fruit. The palate is full of juicy yellow plum toned by lemony freshness. Rounded, fruitful, spicy yet streamlined, this is utterly drinkable, so lay on more than one bottle!

During the harvest last fall winemaker and owner Vicki Pariente said 2007 would be a lean year in Rueda with some great wines. Hers is very pungent and full of nettles, sweat and other cool-climate symptoms. Which doesn't make it a bad wine; just tight, lean and green. If you have liked Dos Victorias Verdejo in the past, stick with it in '07.
There's a faint coppery tinge to this wine's rosy pink hue, and the fruit is somewhat muted, but this remains an enjoyable drink. Leather and scorched cherry flavors are carried by a supple, rounded mouthfeel, finishing with moderate length and intensity. Easy to drink, but not one to hold more than another few months. Certified biodynamic.
Hot, raw and unbalanced, this is not a successful wine despite good fruity flavor.
A closed nose leads to a very fruity, off-dry palate of rich pear flavors: juicy and ripe but tinged with more grounded notes of fresh earth. This is flowing and rounded but fresh and beautifully textured.

With 3% Syrah, this wine has a leathery, gamy character to it, the grapes grown at high elevation. Blueberry and blackberry notes provide a robust backdrop of fruitiness, as chewy, smoky tannins support concentrated black cherry flavor on the finish.
Made from biodynamically grown grapes, this wine is remarkably floral, high-toned and rewarding—a complex commingling of anise, green apple and grapefruit flavors. A gravelly texture gives it context and supports the lingering, succulent acidity.
This ambitious launch is from the owner of Laetitia. The grapes are from the Sierra Madre Mountains of eastern Santa Barbara County. Almost totally Cabernet Sauvignon, the wine is clean, balanced and dry, with an elegant structure. It's rather like a good Third or Fourth Growth. The next step is to build in layers of depth and complexity.
Friendly, ripe pears and stone fruits seem to smile from the glass with this wine. Zingy citrus freshness provides zip on the dry palate that has a fruitful, rounded body and a perfume akin to pine and spruce. It's an appetizing, refreshing composition!
Basic and aromatic, but not what you'd label complex. This is easygoing Gewürz with a sweet, honeyed set of flavors that offer a modicum of spice. Honeysuckle and spice notes work the finish, and as a whole it's a nice wine for simple occasions.
Creamy and crisp, this boasts enticing scents of hawthorn and black locust flower while the tangy palate evokes tangerine, white peach and green apple. Vibrant acidity brightens the fruit flavors.
A lovely Syrah, dry, rich and deeply structured. Appeals immediately   for currant, mocha, Provençal herb and peppery spice flavors that have an exotic edge of balsam-splashed grilled Portobellos. Best now and through 2009.
Retour relies on fruit sourced from so-called “old vine” Pinot vineyards. It's full, fleshy, round and brightly fruity, with plenty of spicy chocolate from extended barrel aging. Some whole cluster fermentation and native yeasts contribute to the complexity. A very fine debut.

Light and fruity, it's fresh and crisp with citrus and toast flavors. Already balanced and with good final acidity, it can be drunk easily now.
Purple in color, with ripe, meaty, earthy aromas mixed with herbs, exotic berry fruit scents and vanilla. This is feisty and full-bodied Pinot with integrated plum, blueberry and well-applied oak. It's a little more citrusy and zesty than in previous vintages, and definitely a heavier style than its Cincuenta y Cinco counterpart, which will allow it to age for another four to seven years.
This wine doesn't try to conceal what it is, a 100% varietal exploration of a hearty grape, though in this case, from a relatively cool area. Black-purple in color, it offers structure and tension atop developed flavors of mocha chocolate and plum.
Tastes like sugared mashed cherries, with heat from excessively high alcohol, namely 16.1%.
Lavish vanilla and cedar nearly take over this wine, leaving just enough dark, plummy fruit to peek through, yet the wine remains true to its varietal roots in its silky mouthfeel. A bitter coffee note sneaks in on the finish. Seems ready to drink.

Red fruit aromas show strongly in this wine. With its juicy acidity and soft tannins, it has fine fruitiness and will age quickly. Drink from 2019.
The blend on this complex red wine is mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, with some Petit Verdot and what the winery calls “other reds.” It's the most interesting of Geyser Peak's 2011s, showing ripe, forward black cherry and red currant fruit, but also notes of dried herbs, minerals, bacon, black pepper, licorice and espresso. While it's not an ager, it grows more interesting as it breathes in the glass.

Here's a thin and lightweight expression from Calabria (the “toe of the boot of Italy”) that offers delicate tones of white flower and peach blossom backed by fresh crispness and zest. It's a very easygoing and informal wine overall.
It's not easy distinguishing one Emiliana Chardonnay from the other; they're all more or less similar. Novas shows a touch of match stick and aromatic harshness, which is offset by softer melon and peach aromas. The palate is full and pulpy, with melony, obtuse flavors. Good for Chile, and decidedly not bitter or pithy
Red-fruit aromas come with notes of leather, spice and stalkiness. Spiky acidity creates a sharp mouthfeel that turns earthier as the acids fade. The flavor profile is tart, with herbal leanings and raspberry. A slight bitterness and not much fruit are what you get on the finish.
Earthy, smooth and seductive, this offering from one of the oldest wineries in the Sierra Foothills has aromas like wet earth, subtle spices and plums. Flavors suggest black-skinned plums and dusky spices, with a relaxed, velvety texture. The acidity is mild for this varietal, while the body is full and the finish lingers.
Shows cherry, tobacco and spice flavors and is nicely dry and silky, but is tired, dull. Lacks life.
94-96 Barrel sample. New wood aromas, follow with solid, dark fruits. This is a powerful wine, which shows elegance and structure together and in balance. A wine for long-term aging. The wood element needs to be watched, though.
Rich, lusty aromas of blackberry, graham cracker and coconut are hard-driving in this blend of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Merlot.

A heavy, full-bodied commingling of cola and dark cherry, this offers bites of minty bay leaf along the way. This accent is welcome and yet risks getting overcome by the ripeness of fruit.

Named after the 15th century owner of this estate, the wine comes from a selection of the best parcels. With impressive tannins, a dense structure and rich bold black fruits, this is a powerful wine. It is full of ripe fruit with a mineral texture and has a good future. Drink from 2021.
This is a blend of Sonoma, Santa Clara and Santa Barbara counties. The vineyards are not specified, but they're clearly of high quality, for the wine is balanced, elegant and delicious. It shows classic Syrah flavors of blackberries, cassis and chocolate, with a spicy edge of white pepper and cinnamon, and is just about as good as Testarossa's more expensive Syrahs.
95-97. Barrel sample. This wine is immensely dark, powered by black plum and a ripe, complex structure; its elements are already molding into place. Expect great things of this wine.
This vineyard-designate Brut sparkling wine opens with subtle tones of sweet grapefruit and lemon curd followed by softer touches of peach and honey. The creamy bubbling is followed by a touch of white pepper.
Rich chocolate and raspberry purée highlight this blend of 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot and 15% Cabernet Franc. High in alcohol, it tastes powerful and a bit bittersweet, with dusty, chalky tannins.
Like all of Beringer's 2001 gold letter single-vineyard Cabs, this one is a cellar laydown. It's hard in tannins now, a dry wine that leaves the palate rasping because it's so astringent. Yet the fruit is gigantically ripe, flooding the mouth with blackberries and cherries that are the essence of those fruits. With all that ripeness, the acidity is crisp and fine. Drink 2008–2020.
Thick and meaty, this Syrah has an unusual-but-welcome aroma of marshmallow, surrounded by notes of dark plum, black currant and a streak of dark chocolate. With a long, lingering and rich finish, this will be great to drink in the winter months.
This Riesling is slightly sweet, but it's balanced by crisp acidity. The tangerine, green apple and peach flavors have a honeyed finish.
Heady aromas of honeysuckle and orange blossom waft from the glass. The easygoing palate offers green apple and citrus alongside bright acidity. It closes on a note of bitter almond.
Ruddy, primary red cherry and berry notes persist from nose to finish on this blend of Baco Noir, Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Ripe black-fruit flavors are fleshy and ripe on the palate, but demure in concentration and length.
The winery's annual showing of “minimal intervention techniques,” this wine offers lime peels, yellow grapefruit and cut grass on the expected and excellent nose. There is a nice pepperiness to the palate, from green pepper to chopped oregano, basil and thyme.
This is a very good wine, but judging from the acidity and tannins, it will benefit with some time in the cellar. Dry and silky, it shows rich flavors of raspberries, cherries, currants, chocolate-covered mints, anise and cedar that are lush and decadent. Decant now, and should come into its own in mid-2010.
With  this bottling, Kenneth Volk has produced the quintessential cool-climate, unoaked Chardonnay. The grape  variety reveals itself strongly, with classic peach and tropical fruit flavors that are very ripe, almost apricoty. The Santa Maria Valley's chilly climate shows up in brisk, mouthwatering acidity, while the finish is thoroughly dry. Additional richness was provided by sur-lie aging, which brings creamy notes.
Combining blackberry jam aromas with rich, ripe fruit flavors, this wine is medium to full bodied, and feels relatively easygoing for this grape variety.
There is an interesting mix of grapes here —with Cabernet Sauvignon with Bordeaux origins blended with the local Négrette and with the Syrah more commonly found in the Rhône. Such is the eclectic nature of Southwest France vineyards. The wine itself is mature, soft and fruity, with light tannins and a perfumed edge. The red-plum fruits are juicy, ripe and with an attractive balance of acidity. Drink now.
This fresh, fruit-driven wine opens with aromas of black pepper, blackberry and violet. It's not overly complex but very tasty and bright, with berry juice, cola, sassafras and a pinch of spearmint.
Grove Mill usually does well with its Riesling, and the 2006 is a refreshingly light-bodied wine with a long, tart, mouthwatering finish that nicely balances its residual sugar. Flavors of green apple, pineapple and lime are complemented by a touch of kerosene.
This wine's intense grapey, jammy aromas lead to very fruity and blackberry jam, melted butter and strawberry syrup flavors. It's medium bodied and sweet.
In this solidly made wine, the varietal character shines through, with cranberry and cherry fruit precisely defined. It offers medium depth and good balance, with a light lick of chocolate in the finish.
Close in quality to Cabernets costing far more, this has elaborate blackberry, cherry and currant flavors. The all-important mouthfeel is dry and crisp, with fine tannins. It's not an ager, but shows plenty of class.
Fresh, clean and showing nice white-fruit aromas along with a hint of sweetness. For the most part, this bargain-priced wine hits the spot. It offers fresh apple, peach and mild oak flavors, and the finish is crisp and of moderate length. Seems a little brighter and better than the average value Chard from Chile. Drink right away.
Chewy tannins and tart acids buttress the midpalate's broad berry flavor. The fruit seems to thin out on the finish, concluding with more bone and muscle than succulent flesh. Pairing this with a rare burger would help tame the structural components.
Tight and tannic now, giving an unrelieved mouthfeel of astringency. That's despite concentrated, powerful blackberry-pie filling, cassis and richly smoked, sweet oak flavors. Give it 5–7 years in the cellar to come around, if not longer.
Juicy and ripe, this bursts open with a flavorful mix of brambly berry, cherry compote and red licorice. It's full and broad, ready for near-term drinking, and yet has the acid backing to age 2019–2021.
Not the darkest, biggest or richest Shiraz to ever come out of Australia, this is nevertheless a delightful wine. A green peppercorn note accents red raspberry and cherry fruit, with just a hint of vanilla in the background. Drink it over the next year or two.
Citrus and floral aromas are mild. This blend of Viura and Chardonnay feels round and chunky, but hardly stocky. Bland flavors of orange and grapefruit fall off on the finish.
Some unripe flavors suggest green mint and asparagus. They limit the score, despite some good blackberry tea, currant and white-pepper flavors. Drink up.
The wine is ripe and fat. It has apple and pear flavors along with a smooth texture. Mouth-filling and dense, the wine seems heavy.
Gilles Nicault, who oversees the Long Shadows portfolio, makes this pure Cabernet. If this had a Napa Valley label on it, it could sell for three times the price. The structure is full and fleshy, but with the vividly bright fruit that screams Washington State. Juicy acidity underscores the berries, cherries and plums; the generously applied new oak adds texture and layers of caramel, coconut and chocolate. A bottle that belongs with Washington's (and California's) best.
Oak, almond and nutmeg represent the rounder, lusher aspects of the 10% Sémillon in this Sauvignon Blanc-based wine, complemented by creamy pear, peach and melon. The two work together well, providing soft layers of crisp goodness in a glass.
This smells jammy and full, with leather, baked black-fruit and balsamic aromas. Saturated, deep and honest on the palate, with a flower note interspersed with blackberry and spice flavors. It falls off a bit on the finish, but on the plus side it's not pounding or aggressive.
Amarone usually delivers soft, smooth tannins but Capitel Monte Olmi, on the other hand, exhibits tight, astringent firmness followed by sweet, jammy fruit. Give this wine another five years to soften in the bottle.
Perfumed with scents of dried flowers, figs, cherries and tea, this round, voluptuous Ribolla is luscious and fruity. It's dry, with a tea-leaf astringency that builds on the palate, and it finishes with a flurry of rose petals and caramelized honey flavors.
With this bottling, Marimar Estate confirms itself as one of the two best, most consistent producers of Albariño in California, along with Longoria. The wine is brilliant, with brisk acidity, dryness, modest alcohol and complex flavors of citrus fruit and zest, minerals, white tobacco and ripe figs.
Ripe flavors of berry, cherry, cassis and toasted oak dominate this perky young Syrah. The tannins are pure Napa—supple and intricate—while the acidity provides a deft touch of tartness. Drink now.
A ripe, apple-flavored wine, this has a round feel that is pierced by crisp, citrusy acidity. Made from grapes that were sourced from the hills above Puligny-Montrachet, this is a generous selection, with yellow fruit flavors that are balanced by the refreshing, crisp finish.
Rubber, smoke and a bit of char combine to give this Garnacha-Graciano blend a hard exterior. The palate is reasonably round, with roasted berry flavors. Finishes a little stewy and slightly tomatoey and herbal, but overall it's a good wine with true Navarran character.
The wine's strong toasty character is balanced by the potential of the ripe fruit and acidity. It's still showing as young, the wood aging covering the fruit. Wait until 2017 and the balance will be right there. This cuvée is harvested from des Demoiselles plots, one of 13 chateaus in the Ducourt family.
Tough in acids and tannins, with a gritty mouthfeel. Although the blackberry, black currant and cedar flavors are very rich and pure, the wine's aggressiveness interferes with its enjoyment. Doesn't seem likely to improve with age.
This vineyard site, like many others in Green Valley, was once planted to Gravenstein apples. That heritage persists in this wine's tartness that highlights an earthiness of sassafras, pomegranate and even citrus, bright elements atop a velvety-smooth texture.
Light on the nose, this shows delicate aromas of Asian pear, honeysuckle, squeezed lemon wedge, fresh coconut flesh and a tiny bit of butter. The palate is also demure yet delicious, with lightly poached apples, squeezed lime and a chalky textural grip.
This is the second of Black Kite's 2009 Pinot Noirs to be released, following the Redwood's Edge last year. It's an impressive wine, dry, richly textured and crisp, showing complex cherry compote, chocolate-covered mint, spice and sandalwood flavors. It's clearly delicious, but gains extra charm from the smooth texture and elegance. Drink now-2015.
The problem is the high 16.2% alcohol that makes the wine hot, Porty and sweet.
A light toasty, meaty aroma and savory flavors help this wine stand out from the pack. Full bodied, it's well structured due to firm tannins and acidity. It should be best after 2018.
Cullen's signature red is 80% Cabernet, 12% Merlot and 8% Petit Verdot this vintage, with a moderate 13% alcohol. Has aromas of black cherry and ink. The same fruit is showing (and is quite tangy) on the palate, moderated by tealike tannins. Full and round, but tough around the edges and not too giving quite yet. A few years in the cellar may turn that around.
What appears as apply, plummy fruit on the nose gains ample spice on the palate. Fermented and aged in used barriques, this wine has an unusual style that really demands food. It's fresh and fruity but with added roundness from wood.
Toasted walnuts, almond paste and dried fruit merge nicely, leaving a velvety smooth trail in the mouth. This wine is a powerhouse despite the higher sugar content, which should soften the effects of 15% alcohol.
Lovely scents of white spring flower, white stone fruit and citrus set the tone on this vibrant savory white. On the mineral-driven palate, notes of saline and Mediterranean herb accent grapefruit, lemon and white peach. It finishes crisp and clean.
This is a very fairly priced Cabernet given its quality. It's made from 100% Cab and all estate grown in the high elevations of Fair Play in El Dorado County. Oaky and smoky, it whispers of mountain fruit, with herb, cassis and blackberry highlights amid a background of savory earth. Age 3–5 years.
Plump and round in the mouth yet not fat or heavy, this is what 2003 can deliver when the wines are well made—easy to like, easy to drink Rieslings of great mass appeal. Ripe stone fruit blends with apple and citrus, picking up hints of melon on the finish. Imported by Magellan Wine Imports.
Pale in color, this is a drier than usual Rosé d'Anjou. It is fresh, soft with attractive wild strawberry fruits and a touch of orange peel. The wine has a tangy texture that makes it extra refreshing. Drink now.
A little thin in flavor, this is nonetheless nice and dry, with gentle tannins framing cherry, herbal tea, spice and sandalwood flavors. Drink up.
Like the winery's other 2005 Chardonnays, this one, tasted in March, is tightly wound and minerally. The aroma will show little if the wine is too cold. Flavor-wise, hints of tart tangerines, lemongrass, green apples, candied ginger and vanilla cream swirl into a smoky oak, spicy finish. This is a Chardonnay that needs some time in the bottle. Drink now and for a couple of years.
La Froscà is a rich and luminous Soave Classico that delivers vibrant tones of stone fruit, lemon blossom and dried sage. This expression shows a very pure and pristine aromatic quality.
The wine is rich, solidly tannic with a dry core. It has the dense color associated with this grape, more normally found in Bordeaux. There are juicy black elements and balanced acidity, with a dry core that makes for a firm wine. Drink now.
This is a very nice Cabernet for drinking now and for a few more years, although you'll want to decant it for several hours. It's dry and tannic, with flavors of blackberries, black currants and cedar, and it has that ineffably hard to describe quality of elegance.
This medium-bodied Chardonnay displays some vegetal notes of canned corn and a slightly oily texture on the finish.
Soft and supple in the mouth, with plum and oak the key flavor components. There are hints of sweetness here, from the brown-sugary aromas that appear with time in the glass, to the ripe, ripe fruit on the palate. Still, it's an excellent, delicious wine. Drink now–2008.
Warm and mulchy at first; this is a muscular, dark wine despite the bargain price, and it's tight, tannic and herbal but serious in weight, structure and depth. The palate shows creamy, oaky, herbal fruit in front of a full, grabby, tobacco-accented finish. Elevated size and structure is what brings it up a notch.
Direct, woody aromas of cherry, raspberry and minerally crispness set up a medium-bodied palate housing round tannins. Ripe, loamy flavors of mixed berries exhibit a touch of raisin, which carries over to a peppery, blackened finish.
Elegant in fine-grained tannins, this well-made, complex wine offers savory cranberry and cassis plus brighter, spicier red fruit, alongside a layering of graphite, dried herb and chocolate. Full bodied, it remains balanced throughout, finishing with length and breadth.
Maycas is Concha y Toro's Limarí Valley project, and the wines show terroir and personality. However, $55 is a lot to ask for this minerally, reserved style of Chardonnay. The palate and nose are narrow and stony, with pineapple and citrus flavors and tight, driving acidity. 500 cases made.
This ripe, juicy wine opens with yellow stone fruit, Spanish broom and faint nut aromas. The medium-bodied palate doles out ripe Golden Delicious apple and mature Bartlett pear flavors, while a pleasant bitter almond note backs up the finish.
This blend of Merlot, Malbec, Petite Sirah and Cabernet Sauvignon is powerful and rich. Aromas of baked black currant, vanilla and brioche are inviting, as are the palate's black cherry and cola flavors. The tannins are a tad chunky, but a grilled steak will take care of them.
Herbaceous and brisk, this elegant, medium-bodied Cabernet perks up on the palate with its crisp red-fruit and acidity. Straightforward yet pleasantly accented with hints of violet and black coffee, it would pair well with a variety of earthy, fall braises.
An intriguing, well-made wine, it conveys saucy red-fruit aromas that come with notes of raw oak, leather and herbs. It smacks the palate with hard tannins and raw verve, while flavors of vanilla, mocha, licorice and berry fruits finish crisp and woody. Drink through 2017.
Brooding aromas of moist soil and dark cherry are followed by big bold cherry flavors that coat the palate. The variety's often burly tannins are kept well in check.
Baking spice, leather, menthol, chopped mint and ripe berry aromas come together on this elegantly structured wine. The firm palate shows mature black cherry, raspberry jam, anise, cinnamon and dried sage while assertive, fine-grained tannins provide support. Drink 2020–2032.
This blend of 70% Roussanne, 14% Grenache Blanc, 10% Viognier and 6% Picpoul Blanc shows potential but is still finding its way. Aromas of Key-lime pith, sea salt, honeydew and walnut oil lead into a slightly bitter palate with tobacco flavors, dried yellow fruit, orange rinds and more nut oils.
Stalky smelling at first but good on the nose thanks to a solid berry core and leathery accents. Feels fresh and pinched, with medicinal flavors matched by equal amounts of red fruit and oak. Finishes clean but short, with decent weight.
89-91 While the tannins are dense, this wine has excellent powerful fruit and great, solid black flavors. It has the fresh acidity of the year.
Here's an inky dark wine, with aromas of plum, leather and forest floor. The palate offers ripe black-fruit flavors, richened further by oak, chocolate, vanilla and café au lait sensations. It closes with drying wood tannins.
Here's a lovely Moscato d'Asti with a pristine and bright quality to both the bouquet and mouthfeel. Not as creamy and frothy as most, the wine drinks like a still sweet wine (the bubbles are light and delicate) with a zesty touch of lemon zest on the close. A perfect apéritif wine.
The aromas on this wine are quite light, conveying wood, herbs and red fruit. This contrasts with the sweet, rich fruit flavors with a gentle grip of tannins.
This is an easy-drinking, crowd-pleaser of a wine. Light to medium bodied, it has fresh strawberry and cherry flavors and a soft, smooth texture.
The smell of canned mushy peas pours out of the glass and just won't release its iron-handed grip. That same intense vegetal character is present at all other points as well, from the thick palate to the murky finish. It doesn't have much going for it, but at least it's consistent.
Structured, rich, but also with good fresh acidity, this is one of the best wines in the Quinta do Portal range. It has lively, vibrant red fruit, along with dry tannins, some vanilla from wood aging. Great acidity in the aftertaste.
Made from the local Rufete grape, this is a prickly, slightly pickled wine. The flavors seem underdeveloped and pithy like pink grapefruit, while the palate feel doesn't really mesh. Too out there to savor a second sip.
Cocoa, baking spice and blackberry aromas lead to opulent herb and dark fruit flavors. This is high-octane but generally holds it well.
Earth and spice make for a nice entry and flavor profile into this wine. However it becomes thin and somewhat diluted on the palate.
St. Helena is the source of this blend of Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Entirely unoaked, it's a dry, crisp, rustic wine, and full-bodied for a rosé, with heavy flavors of cherry pie filling.
This simple sparkler opens with fresh citrus and peach followed by bright acidity and smooth effervescence. Those easy-drinking and refreshing qualities make this Prosecco the perfect summer sipper.
A fresh array of boysenberry, black raspberry, white pepper, crushed violet and dried lavender show on the nose of this bottling by Michael Larner. It's a very lively wine on the sip, with more boysenberry and black pepper as well as crushed lilac character.
This refreshing and crisply designed Viognier conveys restrained aromas of white peach and vanilla. The palate shows yellow melon and creamy peach, but with a razor-sharp edge of acidity and a compelling chalky texture. The acid sizzles into the finish.
Fruity and attractive now, it features touches of lime, spicy underlay and tight crispness. It's ready to drink, very fresh and fragrant.
Saint-Croix-du-Mont is on the slopes across the Garonne river from Sauternes. In years like 2005, it can produce some fine sweet botrytis wines. This has honey, a bite of botrytis and a great lemon edge. Worth aging, but ready to drink now.
Starts with roasted, leathery aromas that feature hints of burnt beef and berry compote. The palate is layered and nicely balanced, with berry flavors hitting first and chocolate coming next. Espresso is the final act, as it ties the mouth to the finish in impressive fashion. A big load but one that's still manageable.
Offers crisp acids and good structure, which only nature can provide. Flavors range from citrus and apples through ripe peach. Its major flaw is that it's so sweet, it's like a dessert wine. If it were dry, it would be gorgeous.
From some of the property's oldest vines, this wine conveys a nostalgic component that's hard to resist, an approachability that meets length and breadth. Baked bread, cherry, vanilla and black tea give way to zesty acidity and a note of forest floor, but nothing competes with the allure of rose petals and orange blossoms that beckon around every corner.
Gentle fruit notes hint at yellow pear, cantaloupe melon and ripe apricot. On the palate, the fruit develops real drive and is edged by the yeasty spice so typical of Grüner, accentuated by appetizing apple tartness and citric lift. The more you savor, the more this gives.
This is slightly bigger and earthier than Ara's other 2009 Pinot Noir, with notes more of beet than cherry, and hints of dried herbs and mushrooms. It's a sturdy wine that could stand up to braised meats.
Tropical is how to best describe the bouquet; it's melony and sweet, but not that zesty or pungent. The palate is round and works well, while flavors of orange pith, lime and sweet grapefruit are just lively enough. Drink now or wait for the 2010.
Pure Merlot sourced from several Columbia Valley vineyards, this opens with inviting toasty scents, quickly moving into a broad, flavorful palate loaded with pretty cherry fruit. The balance between fruit and barrel is perfect, and the wine is ready for near-term enjoyment.
Divus is a bold, earthy expression of Montepulciano with ripe aromas of forest fruit and red cherry, followed by spice and black peppercorn. There's a touch of cherry sourness and bitterness on the finish as well.
Fleshy fruits of white peach and guava and fragrant white flowers trend tropical on the nose of this bottling, but are cut by green apple and citrus skin flavors. The palate is broad with guava cream, apple blossoms, mango and lime chiffon flavors. Quite tasty, but very tropical.
Green Conference pear makes a quick appearance on the nose before yielding completely to grapefruit and lemon zestiness. The palate is streamlined, linear and very refreshing. This is mouthwatering and and totally clean-cut.
A tough, gritty, drily astringent wine with flavors of raisins and cedar. Turns bitter on the finish. Syrah, Sangiovese and Viognier.
A lower selection of grapes than the winery's superior Dona Rosa results in a fresh wine full of apple, nectarine and minerality. Not particularly complex but goes down nicely. Classic everyday Albariño.
Stash this one in the cellar unil 2019 or 2020. Tasted in January 2014, it's tannic, tart in acidity and enormously rich in red cherry jam, pomegranate and persimmon fruit flavors, enriched with sweet, smoky oak. A real beauty from this well-respected vineyard.
A very deep red color catches the attention. Next, strong, wild aromas like smoke and black rubber lead to a rather fruity but still firm and tannic texture. The flavors are more like blackberries and blueberries, but the overall effect is slightly viscous.
This blend of Négrette, Syrah and Malbec sourced from vineyards close to Toulouse is dense, ripe and packed with spicy black-plum fruit. It's opulent and generous, with a smooth rich texture, sweet tannins and a hint of wood aging. This needs 2–3 years to mature.
Floral strawberry notes subtly perfume the nose on this taut and creamily fizzy sparkling brut. The slender, light-footed palate is enriched with some of that broader Pinot-structure and slips down rather easily. This makes for a classy, grown-up apéritif—its dryness lets the fruit and structure speak, offering an echo of beautiful floral overtones.
This is a nutty, almondy rendition of Roussanne, almost to the extent of veiling the remaining pineapple-tinged fruit. It's broad in the mouth and soft in texture, with a trace of warmth on the finish.
A perennial powerhouse Chardonnay from the Cape, this vintage starts off with strong aromas of popcorn and butter before smoothing out and offering flowery orange and white stone fruit notes. Full-bodied, with beautiful balance, the flavors of papaya, mango, spice and vanilla are perfectly integrated. The finish is long;  the only thing this winner really needs is a little more heft in the midpalate. Imported by Vineyard Brands.
Fragrant, aromatic, open, and wonderfully accessible, this smells like fresh-cut roses and violets, and tastes of cherries and chocolate. It's a broad, smooth effort that is open and drinking well right now.
A lush nose of mocha, cinnamon, pepper and clove starts this smooth wine with style. Flavors of cedar, spice and rich fruit are complex and delivered in a mouthfilling, structured wave. A spicy finish adds to the appeal. Ageable but good to drink now; pair with cheese and smoked meats. A blend of 50% Syrah and 50% Kotsifali.
Fresh and clean with a personality largely driven by citrus, stone fruit and toasted bread or yeast, this Italian sparkling wine shows background tones of talc powder and almond skin. There's a touch of sour fruit on the close.
Initial aromas of desert herbs and blackberries lose steam with airing. A flush palate delivers candied cherry and chocolate flavors that carry over to the solid finish.
There is a hint of earth and roasted pumpkin on the nose. The palate has a similarly smoky and dusky aspect and surrounds crisp red-cherry fruit. The body is light with a slight but fine tannic grip. A pleasantly bitter finish counters the pumpkin richness. The finish is very fresh and dry but strangely moreish. This will benefit from a bit of bottle age. Drink now through 2022.
Bacon, sawdust and earth along with cassis and raspberry kick start this lively, acid-driven red. The palate offers tart plum and raspberry, all steered to a point by piercing, laser-beam acidity. Oak plays a prominent role throughout, especially on the finish. The gritty tannins, firm feel and strong acids call for a few years of cellaring.
Delicious, rich and fruity, this is full of peach and citrus fruits that add lift to the wine's ripeness. It's a great apéritif and would also pair well with seafood.
You'll notice a unique and terroir-driven note of freshly milled white peppercorn that distinguishes this Amarone. In the background are generous tones of berry, black mineral and toasted almond. Pair this extraordinary wine with roasted meat or aged cheese.
This is a big, powerful, firm wine, with a top layer of ripe, glamorous fruit flavors. Blackcurrant jelly fruits are shot through with ripe acidity and soft tannins. It should develop relatively fast, but then last well.
This wine starts with a slightly confected cherry nose, leading into delicate bordering on thin flavors of red fruit and cherry. A very soft wine for fans of light, easygoing reds.
Aromas of scorched earth, underbrush, red berry and a whiff of cellar floor lead the nose. On the firm palate, ground pepper, tobacco and sage accent sour cherry while brooding tannins offer firm support.
Fresh and light, this Champagne shows lots of lemon and lime nuances, with slight green-apple and herb notes. It may deepen and improve with age; right now it’s probably best as an aperitif.
Smooth and rich, this is a big wine, initially almost Chardonnay-like in its creamy richness. But then the Riesling's fresh perfumes and intense acidity kick in. White berries follow, while there are hints of white pear. Age this wine for 5 years.
A bright nose of cherry, vanilla and rum cake leads into a moderately intense midpalate, with bright endnotes of dried mint and ginger on the cool, crisp finish.
The local Bical grape gives this wine a delicious and refreshing character. It offers lemon, crisp pear and green plum flavors, all laced by a mineral texture. It is ready to drink, although it will be better from 2016.
Ripe raspberry and strawberry notes are followed by mild tones of vanilla spice, rum cake and tobacco. This blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Sangiovese has a clean, smooth mouthfeel.
At the age of four years, this Cab strikes you as very fruity and also sharp. It has jammy cherry, blackberry, black currant and baker's chocolate flavors that taste like they have a squirt of lime juice for tartness. The oak overlay is strong in char and vanilla, but balanced. The overall impression is of power and elegance, but immaturity. Try holding until 2013, and could develop for many years.
Spunky, lively red-fruit aromas of raspberry and plum are the foyer to a healthy, juicy, fresh Tempranillo with simple red plum and raspberry flavors. A clean finish confirms this basic Rioja's drinkability factor.
An intriguing waxy character shows strongly on the nose of this bottling, with ripe lime and green-apple aromas as well. The flavors are light and delicate, with a touch of pomelo that grows with patience into more tropical yet still restrained papaya and bubblegum elements.
This Cabernet Sauvignon-Carmenère blend is a green machine with a pyrazine-led explosion of green bean and bell pepper aromas. Robust and grabby on the palate, this tastes heavily of herbal plum and canned green bean, while a minty finish includes flavors of olive and bitterness. This feels right but smells and tastes extremely green.
Situated at the mouth of the Pinhão river in the heart of the Douro region, this vineyard has produced a warm, ripe, finely fruity wine. It comes from some of the oldest parcels of the vineyard and is fermented in old open stone fermenters. The wood aging has added to its richness. Drink this wine from 2017.
This is a ripe, fruity wine full of wild strawberry fruit. It is soft although with fine acidity and a crisp aftertaste. The wine is ready to drink.
Throw some steaks onto the grill and drink them with this robust Petite Sirah. It's high in alcohol and dry, with somewhat overripe flavors of blackberry jam, raisins and prunes.
A mix of four clones, it is deeper, more concentrated, and less accessible than the La Serenne bottling, with bass notes of rock, iron and clay. Dusty, tannic, herbal, earthy and slightly metallic, this is a unique expression of Washington Syrah, with black and purple fruits, Asian spices, coffee liqueur, licorice and coal tar, green tea and herbs.
A touch scattered on the nose, with leather, oak and bright berry fruit. Surprisingly tart on the palate, with plum, cherry and berry flavors. A snappy wine with a good core of cherry, but ultimately more racy than classy.
Dry, crisp and slightly viscous, this white shows excessive vanilla from oak treatment that smothers the fruit expression. Medium, buttery finish.
A big, wood-aged wine, which at this stage shows considerable flavors from the Burgundy barrel aging. But then there's the fruit—red berries, cherries and sweetness—merging into what will be a soft, velvet wine. Give it 2–3 years.
Subtle on the nose with hints of pineapples, toast and vanilla, this dry, full-bodied Viognier is surprisingly refreshing on the palate with a wonderful core of fresh apple and pineapple flavors. Brisk lemony acidity and pleasant lemon pith astringency balance out the 13.8% abv. Drink now.
Stylized and excellent Shiraz. Briar and chili powder aromas are subtle; the wine is broad on the palate, with flavors of plum, raspberry and vanilla bean. Tannins are soft and approachable at first, but feel thick and wooly by the time you reach for a second glass. 1,000 cases produced. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates.
Smells resiny and a touch chemical, with cornflakes and vanilla bean notes. The palate is resiny and dusty, with sweet, candied, vanilla-infused flavors that crowd out any fruit that might want to make a stand. Finishes with faux oak notes and more vanilla.
Just 10% of this wine was fermented in new French oak which adds a bit of weight and length. Grapefruit, peach and lime mingle on the palate, a briny afterthought providing an edge. Smooth and refreshing, it ends in a long dream of lemon.
Chile's most expensive wine is excellent, and with only 50 cases being imported it's definitely a collector's edition. The nose is deep, dense and black as night, with olive, tobacco, coconut and bold black fruit aromas. The palate is racy and tannic, and the flavors of plum, cassis, blackberry, chocolate, prune and fig are elevated. A tough and ribald wine that will be at its best from 2012–2015.
This medium-bodied wine has more earthy and floral flavors than straightforward fruit, so it's something a bit different. Well-priced and easy to drink, it can please a crowd.
Drink this wine anytime you need something dry, full-bodied and tannic. It's bold in black currant, leather and pepper notes. The tannins will hold it for many years, but the wine is at its fruity best now.
This is a concentrated and ripe wine with a solid structure that will allow it to age. With bold berry fruits and firm tannins, it is still developing. Give this serious wine until 2019.
If you're unfamiliar with Charbono, it's kind of like Petite Sirah in its inky color, thick tannins and full-bodied mouthfeel. Summers' 2009 is a big wine, bone dry and modest in alcohol, with deep blackberry, grilled meat and black pepper flavors. It's a good barbecue wine that will probably live for 20 years.
Based on the local Castelão grape, this wine is aged in wood for eight months. Its ripeness and soft tannins are both fruity and lightly structured. It is full-bodied, yet has enough acidity to bring out a juicy, fruity aftertaste.
Dusty aromas comprise the dull nose on this bottling. Once sipped, there isn't a lot of distinct flavor, save for some blackberry notes. It will work for a backyard barbecue of ribs and saucy chicken.
This 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Cabernet Franc and 20% Merlot blend has herb-laced blackberry aromas. The dense palate doles out raspberry jam, toast and clove flavors through close-grained tannins that grip the finish. Drink through 2018.
Cracked pepper, thyme and cedar feature on the nose, while the blueberry and black-cherry fruit comes out more on the palate, alongside hints of coffee grounds and asphalt. There's ample weight, while the texture is somewhat loose and open-knit, more corduroy than suede.
This offers ripe cherry and blackberry notes, followed by bright acidity and a palate that bears medium density. It's a great food wine to pair with breaded veal, sausage or meatloaf.
88-90 Barrel sample. Packed, fruity wine, dominated by very fresh acidity. The wine is crisp as much as rich, maybe on the lean side.
A very lean, dry style that focuses on its acidity and green fruits. This makes it a style that needs good bottle aging—the sample tasted was too young. But for those who like dry, crisp Champagnes, this is beautifully made. Imported by Domaine Select Wine Estates.
This is a dense, rich and soft wine, mostly Cab Franc, with 13% Petit Verdot, 4% Cabernet Sauvignon and 3% Malbec. The PV shows through in the wine's thickness and color, followed by flavors of caramel, graham cracker and billowing campfire. The power is intense.
Aromas recall floral air freshener, ripe black berries, spice and menthol. The palate offers sweet blackberry extract accented with notes of grilled herbs and mocha alongside raspy tannins.
Overt can't-miss aromas of mustard and sauerkraut would be fine if this were a hot dog, but it's not. In the mouth, this feels strained and wiry. Sour pickled flavors of cabbage and plum finish raw. This is loaded with challenges and flaws.
Seems rather oaky, with cinnamon, clove and cedar notes all taking the lead over modest black cherry fruit. It's on the lean side for sparkling Shiraz, but maybe you're looking for a touch of austerity, not full-blown fruit.
For sheer deliciousness, it's hard to beat this Syrah. It shows intensely concentrated blackberry, cherry and liqueur flavors, with rich, smoky oak complexities, and the mouthfeel is pure velvet. For all the richness, the wine finishes dry and elegant. Compellingly good, and a worthy alternative to a great Napa Valley Cabernet.
The luscious fruit mix starts with a suggestion of marmalade, then adds plum and cherry. It gains complexity with streaks of graphite, black olive and smoke, polished, lightly earthy tannins and plenty of power through the finish. An interesting, somewhat unusual style of Ethos.
A spicy, floral nose leads into flavors of peach and apple in this assertive Sauvignon Blanc. Dry, medium-bodied and full of fruit, the wine is a nice solo sip or can be paired with anything from grilled seafood to Asian cuisine.
This is a pretty great deal for a wine of this quality, made by consulting winemaker Shane Finley. Mellowed in flavor and oak, it takes time to open in the glass, but does, imparting forest floor, cardamom and a bite of bittersweet cranberry-raspberry within a medium-bodied, smooth texture.
The blend is classic Bordeaux—85% Cabernet Sauvignon, 7% Merlot, 5% Cabernet Franc and 3% Malbec. It's got grip and a sensuous mix of wild herb, black olive and mountain berry. There is plenty of acid to support it, and winemaker J-F Pellet has been pulling back on the new oak, so that newer releases of Pepper Bridge are more structured and tilting more toward a European sensibility, which is to say, ageworthy.
This tropical mélange of fruit and blossoms lives up to its equally ebullient packaging. While deft in body, it bounds from the glass with floral perfume and juicy watermelon and cherry flavors. It's zesty and bold yet spry and fresh—an aptly named accompaniment to summer.
Ripe, loamy blackberry and plum aromas precede a grabby but mostly fresh palate that's loaded with sweet, basic flavors of spiced black plum and fig paste. A jammy, warm finish is beefy in size.
The wine is fresh, its baked apple and green plum fruit cut with intense citrus. The vineyard, with its pure chalk soil, shows strongly in the minerality and steely texture of the wine, promising aging. Drink this complex wine from 2016.
This marches in a completely opposite direction from the oaky, fruity, buttery style of modern Chardonnay. It's bone dry and minerally, with mouthwatering acidity and traces of oranges and limes. The minerality is like a lick of cold steel. What a great food wine at a great price, although production was a paltry 230 cases.
Very dry, tart and earthy, this is a solid Chardonnay to drink now, at a fair price. It has everyday flavors of peaches and green apples.
Fermented and aged entirely in stainless steel, this wine is dominated by tropical fruit, swimming in pineapple and banana aromas and flavors. Unfettered by oak, it boasts sizzling acidity and, while tasty, is somewhat one-dimensional.
This wine is a blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Brooding aromas of wood spice and red and black fruit lead to sultry, well-balanced dark-fruit flavors with a persistently long finish.
Acidic and minty, this Pinot Noir just doesn't have enough richness, despite some modest cherry and cola flavors. Its dry and silky qualities are pleasant.
Here's a bright Chardonnay with a clearly identifiable citric vein that slices through the chewy fruit and pulpy matter. The wine is crisp and lively throughout and offers bright aromas of lemon zest, exotic fruit and stone fruit. Pair it with grilled sea bass with fennel seeds.
“Dosage Zéro” means no sweetness has been added to this sparkler and the result is an intensely nutty wine with aromas of toasted almonds and walnuts, fresh apple and peach cobbler. Those toasty, nutty notes spread evenly throughout the mouth thanks to the wine's smooth creaminess. Imported by Paterno Wines International.
Blackberry, tobacco and balsamic aromas lean slightly towards vinegar, and there's a distinct tangy quality to the palate. Otherwise, the wine is very nice, with plum and blackberry flavors. Tobacco notes reappear on the finish along with toasty oak. Will do best with food.
This delivers the best of both worlds for this aromatic grape. Crispy cut-grass notes blossom into tropical pineapple guava and green papaya. A laser focus of lime on the palate subsequently opens toward green pears, freshly cut oregano and dill, and an apple skin-driven bitterness.
This partnership between the Rhône's Michel Chapoutier and his American importer seems remarkably consistent. Peppery clove aromas presage a medium-bodied, silky wine that combines spice with black olives on the midpalate. It's long, finely textured and espresso-tinged on the finish.
There's a smoky, meaty quality here with mature fruit, cola, mesquite and cured meat nuances in the background. La Colombina boasts impressive intensity and lingering spice flavors.
This Shiraz offers wonderful purity of fruit, ranging from blueberries to raspberries, just touched with hints of cracked pepper, cinnamon and toast. Atypically structured for a wine under $20, this medium-bodied example of Margaret River Shiraz should drink well from 2013-2023.
Rustic, flat and chemical at first, with offsetting caramel sweetness to the nose. The palate is big and dark, with herbal, candied flavors and a peppery, creamy finish. Not the most pure wine to process but for 85% Alicante Bouschet it's not bad and seems to get better in the glass.
This is a soft, simple wine, that's ripe with orange, green apple, pear and lime flavors. Honeyed on the finish, it tastes like it has some residual sugar.
An impressive wine, a real star, with its honeyed aromas, rounded green fruits and a concentration of power that is balanced with acidity and a light, floating aftertaste.
From a biodynamic vineyard in the heart of Sancerre, this wine is tight, mineral-driven and very young, well balanced between herbal and citrus flavors. These are lifted and filled out with the ripe Rocha pear flavors that give an extra juicy element. The wine will age well and will be better after 2018.
This tastes like it could be anything from Chardonnay to Sauvignon Blanc to Grenache Blanc, but it's rich in honey, orange and buttered toastflavors. It's seems a little sweet, but it has a good cut of acidity.
Young and appealing now for its vibrant, upfront cherry and oak flavors, this supple Cab has a lush, fine array of dusty tannins, as well as fine acidity. It's beautifully balanced, a tremendously fruity wine that's has a classic structure and elegance.
A formidable rival to Moscato notoriously produced in Italy, this soft sparkler is sure to please. Rose petals, sweet lychee and peach purée draw you into the creamy yet effervescent texture. The long, juicy finish ends clean and satisfying.
The bouquet on this Priorat is raisiny, with tobacco and schisty aromas. The palate is one part jumpy and another part stewy and clumsy, with baked berry flavors that come with a tangy citric edge. The finish is long, with tobacco, stewed fruit and hard tannins. Drink now through 2015.
A nice discovery at a great price. This is a spicy, bold and concentrated wine with exciting oak accents that are like earth, pepper and cardamom resting on a firm palate of rich berries, grilled meat and black pepper flavors. The fine-grained tannins add good grip to the mouthfeel.
A grapefruit pith note dominates the finish, taking away from the more traditional refreshing lift that one might expect from Sauv Blanc. But the rest is gorgeous and inviting, with notes of white peach, hard gooseberry and white cranberry throughout.
A heavy, cheesy-smelling wine that turns rougher and more gaseous as it opens. The palate is high in acidity, yielding underdeveloped, tart black cherry and plum flavors. Sharp on the finish, with a lean feel. Doesn't ever find a groove.
This is a jammy, lusty wine with aromatic notes of graphite on top of core blackberry scents. The palate is chunky and full, while the flavor profile is pure jammy blackberry. A quick, staunch finish is a fine conclusion.
The bouquet on this blend of Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Noir is stuck in neutral, while flavors of citrus and lemon bend towards sour. The finish is briny and tangy.
The 2005 and 2006 bottlings of this Cabernet were awesome. So is this 2007. At the age of more than six years, it's just beginning its long journey. It's still tannic, but with ripe, sweet tannins that frame gorgeous, deeply satisfying blueberry, black currant, mocha and cedar flavors. It drinks well now, and will develop further in the bottle over the next eight years.
This young Aglianico opens with aromas of ripe black and red berries, oak, espresso, leather and vanilla. The concentrated palate offers red cherry, raspberry and licorice alongside drying wood tannins.
Off-gold in color, this wine bares aromas of candied fruit, pineapple, pear and exotic fruit. The wine's texture is naturally round and smooth thanks to the rich glycerin.
Another of Noceto's stellar small-production Sangiovese, this one plummy with tobacco and sour cherry most prominent and a slight hint of sweetness as it finishes. Dos Oakies comes from the winery's oldest vineyard section of Sangiovese and has a loyal following of Sangiovese lovers.
Pungent, minty and quite tannic, this young wine needs more time to pull its flavors together. There's a nice whiff of vanilla cream wrapped into the finish.
This is a lovely, sophisticated Sauvignon Blanc, with rich aromas of candied fruit, apricot, honeysuckle and amazing aromatic intensity. Thick, creamy and enduring on the palate, this beautiful wine shows the structure for long cellar aging.
It can't be easy to turn a hearty red grape like Aglianico into an informal, easy-drinking red. Despite the grape's famously unyielding tannins, Terra di Vulcano has an easy approach, with notes of bright berry, dried herb and a touch of green pepper at the back.
When Zweigelt is vinified as a simple country wine, this is the joyous, easy-drinking thing you get. There is no heaviness; instead you have a slight grip of tannin and fresh, lively acidity along with peppery spice. This calls for platters of charcuterie.
This offers a classic Nebbiolo nose of rose petal, dark berry, tilled earth and a balsamic note. The lean palate shows sour red berry, grilled herb, clove and a hint of mocha on the finish. Tightly compacted tannins and brisk acidity need time to unwind. Drink after 2019.
This very limited block selection is too thin, herbal and green to offer much pleasure. Tannins are stemmy and overtake the fruit.
One of the best vintages of Rubicon to date, and for the price it's a fantastic value that's great for building up your cellar. Right now, the wine is still young and tight, with firm, gripping tannins that need some time to mellow. Fortunately, there's a great concentrated black-fruit core and enough acidity alongside the tannins to support long-term aging. Spicy and earthy, with accents of black tea, cedar and crushed violets. Try after 2016.
Importer Robert Kacher has an impressive stable of rosés from the southern Rhône at terrific pricing. this one, from the undervalued right bank of the valley, features 70% Cabernet Franc. Peaches, cherries and hints of peppery spice combine easily, then end on a note of wet stones. Drink now.
The vineyard is located in the western part of Sonoma County, near the little town of Freestone. The cool 2011 vintage lends mouthwatering acidity to the wine, brightening flavors of red apples, pomegranates and persimmons. Right now, it's juvenile and tight, with primary fruits that are unintegrated with oak. Give it at least eight years in the cellar, and it could be going strong at the age of fifteen.
This ultraripe and fruity effort tastes of raspberry compote. There are drying tannins and a hint of bark or leaf, with just a bit of warmth on the finish. The fruit comes from two of Red Mountain's finest sites—Kiona and Ciel du Cheval –
For a higher-priced wine, this has some issues. The nose is heavy and murky, with leathery, baked aromas. In the mouth, it's somewhat choppy and acidic, thus punctuating the cherry tomato portion of the earth-and-leather flavor profile. Lingering oak accents the finish, which is zesty and leans toward sour.
Scented yellow plum jumps from the glass and also fills the palate with easy, unburdened joy. The mousse is somewhere between creamy and frothy and disperses great freshness. The finish is wonderfully dry and emphasizes a punch of lemon.
I'm a big fan of Abacela's wines, and appreciate the effort to do a varietal cab franc, but this wine could benefit from a bit of blending. Tart, spicy and slightly sweaty, it has the expected blueberry fruit and leathery tannins of cab franc, but the tannins are so dry and dominant that they undercut the middle of the wine and skew the finish. Interesting but not entirely complete.
Mildly burnt smelling, with whiffs of charred toast and forest fire. Plenty of black cherry, plum and brown sugar comprise the palate, which is also laden with licorice and spice. Numerous merits secure its place in the box seats, but could be too oaky for some folks.
A beautiful orange pink color sets the scene for this intense rosé. It has maturity now, but certainly not old age, retaining great swathes of fresh red currant and grapefruit to go with the toast that is just showing. It is sophisticated and full-bodied, a wine that commands attention.
Spicy and smoky, this wine is dark with tannins and dryness. Its dark chocolate and bitter coffee flavors suggest tough extraction. The fruit does not stand a chance.
Alluring toast and spice aromas lead to bright red cherry and raspberry flavors that are well accented by oak flavors of cinnamon, nutmeg and black pepper. The wine has good complexity combined with a firm and appetizing texture due to moderate tannins and acidity.
This Cabernet from Drama has a nose of savory meat, pepper and cassis and offers an intriguing blend of savory and fruity flavors like raspberry and cherry. The rich mouthfeel and lingering finish add appeal, as do the tannins, which are smooth but ageable. An impressive, unfolding red.
With 12% alcohol, you might expect this to be on the dry side, but it's not. Instead, it's sweet and oily, with ripe apple, pear and peach fruit vying with notes of crushed stone. Lingers a bit stickily on the finish.
A very crisp wine, with a fine mineral texture, this pulls in the direction of green fruits, citrus and a tangy, zesty character. Brisk and fragrant, it needs another few months to be at its best. Screwcap.
Pungent and spicy, dark and brooding, this wine brings it with deep, sappy berry fruit and overtones of meat and garrigue, all with muscle and verve. Tannins are firm and hard, showing some ripe stem and earth flavors, and plenty of barrel toast. Muscular and warm, this Syrah walks the line perfectly between the Rhône and Barossa.
Intensely floral aromatics distinguish this pure varietal wine. Those body powder scents linger in a soft, lightly floral palate, along with flavors of citrus flesh and rind.
This longtime winery recently rebranded all of its packaging into a more art-driven style, and it is buckling down on winemaking as well. This bottling from Sierra Madre Vineyard shows light aromas of white peach, grapefruit and the slightest hint of butterscotch. The chalky flavors are easy to like if not overly complex, with light lemon and nectarine touches.
A pleasant, complex and highly likeable Pinot Noir for drinking now. It's made in a lighter style, with a silky mouthfeel framing cherry and raspberry Lifesaver candy flavors. The acidity is especially nice, giving the wine a bracing feel.
This is an impressive, powerful wine. It speaks of the hard landscape of the Douro Superior, with its structure and dark tannins. At the same time, ripe dark fruits push through the still-young tannins giving the potential for a rich, black fruit dominated wine. Predominantly Touriga Nacional (60 percent), this wine is a new venture created by João Nicolau d'Almeida (who has run Ramos-Pinto for many years) and his family. Drink from 2018.
Traditional and elegant, this Barbera opens with notes of leather and seasoned wood. More fruit shows through on the palate, with cherry and plum flavors leading to a leather-infused finish offering up just the slightest brush of tannins.
The complexity starts with dusty mineral tones that slowly segue into perfectly mature blackberry, balsam tones and spicy oak notes at the end. It is that amazing evolution of aromas, which reads like a storybook of Tuscany, that makes this wine a standout.
Vincent Lataste's organic wine is light, bright and immediately refreshing. This is a wine that shows a strongly herbal side. It has citrus and green apple flavors that are crisp and tight. With perfumed acidity at the end, the wine is delicious to drink now. It won 2016 Best of Wine Tourism award for B&B in giant wine barrels.
Here is Viognier picked early enough to feature flavors of citrus rind rather than ripe peach. There is also a powerful herbal note, tasting of juniper and quinine, that lays down a spicy spine in the wine. All stainless, no malolactic; it's crisp, precise and laser-like in its focus.
A jammy, grapey bouquet offers blueberry and spice aromas but not much complexity or nuance. The palate is lively, with acidic cut and leathery, herbal flavors of raspberry, plum and pepper. This is bouncy feeling and tastes earthy and chocolaty on the finish. Drink now through 2015.
While rich, this wine is well balanced with its fresh acidity and wild strawberry flavors. Citrus and a tangy orange texture are both attractive and give the wine a great lift. Drink now.
At nearly 80% Merlot and the remainder Malbec, this is a medium-bodied red possessed of bright, vibrant cassis fruit with chocolate and herb overtones. It finishes firm without being hard or tough, so it may be consumed now and over the next 5–7 years.
A little bit of oak and forest gives this basic Cab some early complexity, and in the mouth it doesn't disappoint. There's nice red fruit and some grabby tannins and acids. It's a true everyday performer that should please most red-wine drinkers.
Dry and tannic, this Cab has flavors of cooked berries and cured tobacco. It's kind of old-fashioned.
The wine is easy-drinking, smooth and tasty, really needing no further aging to show its stuff. Polished tannins, round sweet fruit, plenty of baking spices and a chocolaty finish—what's not to like?
You might want to give this 2–3 years in the cellar to meld. Currently, the palate is thick and heavy with jammy raspberries and cherries, with quite a lot of new French oak.
This is a full-bodied wine, soft and smooth with integrated tannins, yet robust in black cherry and graham cracker. The savory fruit is seasoned in baking spices and a touch of herbes de Provence, finishing with aplomb.
Translating to “The Boss's Red,” this blend of 50% Zinfandel and 50% Merlot is a bomber, with aromas of violet-laced fudge cake, ginger snaps, stewed black cherries, vanilla and sarsaparilla. The palate is all about purple flavors, with ginger-molasses spice as well as lifting spearmint and lilacs.
Marked by excessive oak, with toasty-sweet caramel flavors dominating the ripe blackberry and cherry pie flavors. Nice tannins, though. Drink now.
Open-grained oak aromas sit on top of dark-berry scents. This blend of Tannat, Merlot and Zinfandel is ripe and beefy on the palate, with jammy weight. Toasty black-fruit flavors are peppery and spicy, while this displays a firm grip on a dark, smoky finish.
Tasmania, with its cool climate, has become Australia's best region for sparkling wine. This cuvée features hints of biscuit and ginger on the nose, while the flavors lean toward ripe, tropical fruit. It's light to medium in body, with a dry, clean finish.
Enticing scents of violet, rose and woodland berry escape the glass. Full bodied and polished, the palate delivers black cherry, cranberry, licorice and crushed herb while austere fine-grained tannins and bright acidity provide an age-worthy framework. It's still young and taut and needs several more years to fully develop. Drink 2023–2033.
Sweet oak and mint aromas vie with berry fruit on the bouquet. Feels chunky, round and full, with sweet plum, ripe berry, lactic and mint notes. Falls off on the finish, which is sweet but simple.
The term “feinherb” is only rarely seen on German wine labels, but it indicates a dry-ish version of whatever prädikat is in question, sort of a halbtrocken. This version is nicely balanced, and yes, on the dry side, with apple and melon aromas and flavors that finish dry and minerally. Imported by Chapin Cellars.
Flinty notions of (good) reduction still grace the closed nose and bring memories of Burgundian cellars. The palate has a masterfully light touch. The fruit is tart and red, hinting at red currant and crushed cranberries with a pleasant, inviting tartness that exudes aroma and focuses the palate with its preserving freshness. Yet there are notions of fragrant and ripe raspberries. This is a silky babe in arms, so wait for the wine to unfold fully from 2017 to 2020.
Grapy and floral smelling up front, this Bonarda smells reduced. A tight, rubbery palate is drawing but freshened by a mild shot of acidity. Savory oaky plum and berry flavors finish baked, minty and oaky.
Here's a balanced, young Cab-based Bordeaux blend. It's juicy in tutti-frutti Lifesaver candy flavors of blackberries, cherries and raspberries, yet is quite dry, and the acid-tannin structure gives it an elegant framework. Seems best now for its youthful pizzazz.
This firmly structured wine has dense tannins that are built for aging. It's a rich, complex blend that is half Touriga Nacional, yielding both perfume and minerality. Drink from 2019.
Beautiful and lush, with wildly delicious raspberry, cherry and red currant flavors. That's not all. There are fine mineral notes, the acidity is near perfect, and the tannins are soft, ripe and succulent. Balanced in alcohol and gorgeous to drink now, making it one of the best Solomon Hills Pinots ever.
There's the slightest trace of oxidation on this wine that adds a cardboardlike characteristic to what would otherwise have been a pristine Prosecco. And despite its peach and citrus flavors, the mouthfeel lacks a tonic, crips edge.
Both tannins and ripe berry fruits are in juicy balance in this wine. It gives it density as well as a crisp character that is enhanced by the smoky flavor that comes through. Drink this wine from 2018.
Leafy, scratchy aromas of dried plum and raspberry give way to lemony, grainy oak scents. This is medium bodied, tightly wound and tastes of dried red fruits mixed with cocoa powder. A spicy, dry, crisp finish reinforces the wine's limitations.
Pale to mid-gold in color with a heady nose of exotic spice, rose water and floral blossoms with a hint of smoke. Round and warming on the palate. Sweet yet fresh and juicy with moderate intensity of citrus and stone fruit flavors. Some savory earthy notes on a moderately long finish.
Ripe and juicy, this opens with aromas of dark berry, leather, underbrush and a whiff of game. The round, chewy palate doles out black cherry extract, clove, tobacco and star anise while meaty tannins provide the framework. Drink 2018–2023.
Huge investment is paying off at Labegorce. And it has not resulted in a wine that is simply modern in style. For here the new wood is well integrated, the fruit is structured, and never too extracted, and the ripeness also has layers of Bordeaux dryness.
Plenty of new oak is announced via aromas of coconut, mint, vanilla and burnt toast. but offsetting that is lively berry and cola flavors. As it opens and settles in, you get a wall of fierce tannins that aren't likely to fade any time soon. So unless you have years to cellar this wine, it will likely hold onto its hard, tannic personality. Hold another three years, if possible.
The aromas leap out of the glass, with notes of freshly peeled tangerine, white flowers, jasmine and honeysuckle. It drinks quite sweet but manages to stay in balance. It's a delicious example of this variety. Enjoy it for dessert.
Smoke and fruit, citrus peel and cream—what a seductive combination! This is subtly oaked Sauvignon Blanc of the finest order, from verdant Styria. The palate is taut but elastic, there is focus but also charm and whole oceans of gentle, tropical fruit with a fillip of lively citrus. It is hard not to drink this now but if you have patience, or even better, a whole case, do wait and this will flourish. Drink 2015—2020.
A long with aromas of dried cheese, earth and rubber, there's enough clean black fruit to bring it home. The palate is snappy and fresh, with edgy, lively plum and berry flavors. The finish is short but offers some flashes of quality. Basic but solid Cab.
This solidly structured wine shows the firm tannins and mineral structure typical of wines from Côte du Py. It has dense black cherry fruits along with sacidity that cuts through the structure. It could age another year, but is worth drinking now.
Il Palagio offers easy aromas of black currants, cola, spice and subtle shadings of tobacco and leather. The wine has medium intensity and washes over the palate in a bright and refreshing way.
This dense, ruby-colored Barbera delivers aromas of plush fruit, drying mineral, toasted nut and moist tobacco. There is a nice ensemble of fresh cherry and blackberry in the background and the wine tastes rich and dense in the mouth with a long, smoky aftertaste.
Lavender honey and lanolin notes are warm and enticing in this semisweet Riesling from Lamoreaux Landing. A tad sugary on the attack, it gains balance on the midpalate thanks to delicate green floral tones and ample notes of bitter lemon pith.
Hard, dark tannins, a good amount of wood  and acidity—if that doesn't sound initially promising, the ripe black berry juice and jam flavors come pushing through, creating a powerful, chunky wine.
Brambly soft vanilla marks this wine that's otherwise bright in blueberry fruit and zesty acidity. Medium in weight, it has an abbreviated finish.
Referring to the altitude of the vineyards from which the grapes for this wine were sourced, here's a defined and moderately intense Cab that delivers. Cassis, black berrry, tobacco leaf and a soft eucalyptus herbality appear throughout, with a suggestion of fresh coffee grinds unfolding on the finish. Balanced and structured with medium weight and appropriately gripping tannins.
Funky aromas that recall game and farmyard carry over to the palate along with sweet vanilla and toast. Warm and forward, it ends on an overripe, overly sweet note.
A bit off course as Verdejo goes, with spritz to the palate and then mealy citrus and persimmon flavors. Lingers but doesn't do or say much on the finish. Not bad but it doesn't click.
Too leesy and oaky for my taste, with tough, earthy-lemony flavors underneath. Acidity is tart.
This wine displays all of the intensity of expression of Cold Creek. Aromas of toasty spices and pear are light but lead to a full, rich-feeling palate, with the acids providing a perfect counterbalance.
A very nice example of a dry Gewürz. Name an exotic spice, and you'll find it here, especially cinnamon. The fruit is all about oranges, pears and lychee, while acidity is brisk and fine. Will challenge home chef and sommelier pairing talent. Pork and stewed fruit come to mind.
Leathery aromas mix with black tobacco leaf, blackberry, blueberry and dark-chocolate chips on this reserve-level bottling by the regional pioneer producer, now owned by William Foley. Woody yet ripe fruits consume the palate, which shows more blueberry as well as elderberry, wild mint and a slightly caramelized finish.
Easygoing and fresh, this ruby-colored wine offers sweet cherry nuances with lighter aromas of almond and ground cinnamon. It's a cheerful and sunny wine that shows good integrity of fruit and a clean, crisp finish.
You want decadence, opulence and fabulosity in your Chardonnay? This one's for you. It's tremendous in ripe pineapple, pear, peach, mango, lime, tangerine and papaya flavors. So much fruit, while the oak application is never heavy handed, applying just the right touch of buttered toast. Where does all that vanilla honey come from? A magnificent example of a first-growth California Chardonnay, at a great price.
This everyday Tempranillo opens with mildly burnt and stalky aromas, but there's enough fresh plum and berry on the nose to keep things positive. The mouthfeel is wiry and alert, while plum and raspberry flavors finish short.
A lovely flinty character graces the yellow apple, peach and orange cream aromas on the nose of this friendly wine. It's quite round and mouthfilling, with a prevailing smoky flavor on the palate that's reminiscent of baked apple with bacon crumble. Drink now.
There's a good streak of acidity behind this dry wine, which is fortunate because the tannins are very soft. It has just enough crispness to balance the ripe cherry and sweet green herb flavors. Similar to Sangiovese, this is a pleasant sipper now.
Spice and herb notes accent smoke and earth on this bristling off-dry Riesling. The palate boasts pretty floral tones against ripe white-grapefruit and peach flavors, along with an acidic backbone that drives the finish long and steely.
Heady aromas of honeysuckle, jasmine and white stone fruit lead the way on this round semisweet sparkler. On the silky palate, tangy acidity brightens ripe white peach, green apple and candied tangerine slice. A creamy mousse provides the polished backdrop.
This is adequately pungent on the nose, with a touch of the veggies. The palate is modest in acidity but not flat or flabbby. Flavors of green fruits mix with a hint of asparagus, while controlled capsicum and bitterness work the finish.
Shows a nicely crisp, silky texture and ripe cherry flavors, but there's something about the tannic structure that's a little rustic. And despite low alcohol, there's a stewed taste in the finish. Drink now.
An evenly dispersed nose of sage bark, cherry compote and lightly toasted cedar introduces this bottling by Fred Brander, a Santa Ynez Valley winemaking pioneer now actively trying to create a new Los Olivos District appellation. The flavors are balanced between cherry fruit and oak, with smooth tannins throughout.
There's a touch of juicy sweetness here that recalls ripe blackberry or strawberry tart. You'll also recognize tones of spice, leather and tobacco that make for balanced background flavors.
Equal parts Malbec and Merlot add to the whole of this wine, which is thick and extracted in black fruit and firm tannins. With a floral undercurrent and spicy rocky tones, it combines blackberry and currant with a rich addition of caramel.
Cyprus's historic dessert wine is well represented in this aged selection. On the nose, toasted nut, spice and citrus. A nicely balanced and rich array of spice, nut and bright lemon character on the palate give the wine an opulent yet lively feel. A unique wine, and delicious with dried fruit, cheese, nuts.
Plump and ever so ripe, with hedonistic cinnamon, caramel and coffee aromas atop jammy black plum and prune. A tiny bit soft on the palate, but with enough racy kirsch, cassis and nutmeg to rank it as a showstopper. Port-like at the end, where you finally feel some tannic weight.
This finest selection Chardonnay is a blend of the winery's various vineyards. It's pretty oaky, with vanilla, buttered toast and honey dominating, yet there are enough tropical fruit, orange, pear and apricot flavors, and brisk acidity, to counter-balance the wood. Drink now.
With floral aromas mixed with darker notes of asphalt, mineral, leather and berry fruit, this opens well. The palate is rubbery in feel but structured. Flavors of bold berry fruits, chocolate and herbs end chewy, warm and chocolaty. For a basic Carmenère-Cabernet blend, this is on the money.
This bottling from the Dwarf Oak Vineyard offers pear, struck flint and smoked nut aromas, with the slightest hint of tropicality. The palate is rich with melted butter and roasted macadamia nut flavors—due, perhaps, to the warmer valley climate.
Some tasters will really love this Walla Walla Valley Syrah for its massive flavors of liquorous coffee and vanilla. A cookie dough baking spice flavor abounds, but at the moment, the fruit seems hidden. Perhaps it just needs more bottle age to balance itself out—time will tell.
The Singerriedl is the most renowned vineyard in Spitz, and this ripe but cool example shows its great minerality and taut apple skin tannin structure. Rounding the wine out is an attractive, creamy finish.
Along with the Freedom Hill bottling, the Savoya is the wine of the vintage for Ken Wright. A beautifully-crafted mix of brambly berry, thistle and herb, this textural and detailed effort keeps developing added complexity as it rolls across the palate. Blackberry, black cherry, and hints of truffle infuse the complex, deliciously satisfying finish.
Fronton, a small vineyard area just outside Toulouse specializesin the Negrette grape. This gives a dried fruit character, along with juicy black grapes and a dense, dusty texture. The wine has a touch of wood to smooth out the rustic wrinkles.

This is the second-label white wine from Château Carbonnieux. It's a fresh, uncomplicated wine, which is given richness from the wood flavors and softness from the superripe year.
Full and clean, with a bright nose of cherry, plum and pepper. This is full-bodied, with extract and tannic bite. But the flavors of berry and plum are solid and round, while burnt-toast notes darken up the finish. Lots of snap and focus. Modern and ready to drink.
A little bitter and rough around the edges, but a very delicious wine, with lots of cherry, red currant, liqueur, bacon, Dr. Pepper cola and cinnamon spice flavors. Give it a brief decant and drink now.
Dark in color and full-bodied for a rosé, this dry wine is enormously concentrated in the ripest, sweetest red and black cherries. Turns increasingly complex in the mouth, showing layers of anise, vanilla and spice.
The black-cherry, plum and soy elements of the deep, almost profound, bouquet set you up for a serious wine.

Finishes long, with firm but refined tannins and polished, dark fruit flavors. Best from 2004–2015.
This simple wine has some attractive citrus fruit. It is light, bright with plenty of acidity to keep it all fresh. It should be drunk now.
This blend of six grapes is crafted from the left-over barrels in the multi-wine Long Shadows lineup. The 2011 version is one third Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Sangiovese, and the rest a mix of Merlot, Petit Verdot, Syrah and Malbec. It's a pleasant red, ready to drink, a bit amorphous but with nice details of black olive, strawberry and sweet tomato.

Edgy acidity and a dense body give way to a long, jammy finish that ends in a burst of spice.
This is an ageworthy wine, a classic blend of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. It is rich while also having great acidity, fragrant citrus and tight, steely texture. These elements mean this complex wine, while ready to drink, could age in bottle through at least 2016.
Like the tannic 2005, the winery's '06 needs time in the cellar. It's a bit hard and closed. But it's simply humongous in flavor, offering a deep well of blackberry and mulberry flavors and various wild berries with no names. You'll also detect dark chocolate, anise, Asian spices and beef jerky. Decant now, but best 2010 and beyond.

A really good wine for the price, this offers a dark color and varietal aromas of black cherry, black olive and faint dried herbs. Next it layers handsome oak on the rich and fruity flavors. The texture is quite dense without being heavy; while somewhat tannic the mouthfeel is not drying.
A robust, complicated Syrah that shows potential, and calls for some time in the cellar. It's dry and classically structured, with firm tannins and brisk acidity framing opulent black currant, leather, Provençal herb, pepper and floral flavors. But those tannins lock down the palate. It's hard to predict a wine with no history, but this one might blossom after 2010.
On the earthy side of Zweigelt, this is a firm wine, showing spice and meatiness. The fruit is fresh and easy, the tannins soft, but there is also a rustic character. Screwcap.
An interesting Pinot Noir marked by the acidity and primary fruit of extreme youth. Dry and silky, it shows vibrant flavors of cherries, rose tea, pomegranates, cola and smoky cedar, with 40% new oak. A bit aloof and tough, although extremely elegant. Could begin to develop bottle complexity after 2010.
Visan is a village that can produce some ageworthy wines, and this looks to be in that same mold, with firm tannins framing blackberry and black olive flavors. Give it another year or two, then drink it over the next 5–6.

An intriguing mix of pepper, rose petals, stone fruit and zesty lime creates a heady aroma. The palate is more toned down but all the more appealing for it.

This wine is rich with jammy fruits and ripe acidity. Firm tannins are only just making a mark on the sweet, fleshy fruitiness.

Still spritzy, very tart and tangy, with orange peel and lemon drop flavors.

Very pungent aromas, with piercing red fruit and light touches of citrus on the nose. At first it’s shockingly tart and tight, so much so that it might throw you for a loop.

This unusual rosé is a cofermentation of 80% Pinot Noir and 20% Pinot Blanc. It's an uneasy compromise, with neither grape really taking the lead.

Dark and tight, with toasted, masculine aromas that hint at barrique aging. The palate is serious and firm as it houses dark berry and plum flavors along with chocolate and smoke. A forward wine that should please most fans of Tuscan Sangiovese.
Visually, this is a stunning wine: It's extracted and dense with purple-ruby streaks and leaves thick trails of glycerin on the glass. The nose is not as intense as you'd expect but it does dole out good portions of sweet, luscious fruit, mulberries, plums, blackberries and a touch of cookie dough. It ages 12 months in barrique.

One of the two estates in the Douro still in the hands of descendants of Dona Antonia Ferreira, who created so many Douro quintas, Vallado is able to produce great white wines as well as reds and Ports. This wood-aged Reserva is smooth, lightly toasty with freshness and citrus as well as pineapple and spice. It will age for several years and will be best from 2016.
The blend is light and deft, with nicely defined streaks of melon, grapefruit and orange peel. It warms up midpalate and brings in streaks of caramel and butterscotch as it gracefully falls away, with no trace of bitterness.
This is a classic Bordeaux-style white wine with its cool herbal character and light perfume from the Muscadelle in the blend. The wine has no oak aging, just ripe fruit that has citrus, pineapple and green fruit flavors. Drink now.
The vineyard has had a long, checkered history, and Byron has dipped into it for many years for Pinot Noir that's almost always compelling. Their ‘06 is a dark, full-bodied wine. It's dense in young, jammy black cherry and mocha fruit and very spicy. Feels dramatically rich and complex, and should develop bottle nuance over the next six years.
Aromas of apricot and white spring flower lift out of the glass. The apricot note follows through to the palate, along with yellow peach, honeydew melon and almond, all framed in bright acidity. This one closes on a flinty note.
This Roussanne, Viognier, Marsanne and Grenache Blanc blend is very rich and fruity. It has all kinds of fruity, flowery, spicy and toasty flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. A nice, easy-drinking alternative to a creamy Chardonnay.
Nuits Saint-Georges is the home of the Aegerter family and its Domaine. This ripe spicy smoky wine is rich both from the vintage and from the core of tannins that are typical of the appellation. It is a smooth rounded wine although it will need some aging. Drink from 2020.
Big, rich and extremely impressive given the price; this wine competes with and beats some Riberas that cost five times more. It's textured, deep, silky and layered, with integrated berry, plum and cassis flavors. Packed and generous all the way to the finish; drink now or cellar for up to 10 more years. From 80-year-old Tempranillo vines.
Bold center-cut oak aromas are lemony and resiny, while notes of coconut and vanilla are present along with cassis and plum scents. A saturated palate is full of power and energy. Flavors are heavily oak influenced, meaning mocha and coffee notes are as prominent as plum and berry fruit. Drink this serious Malbec through 2023.
Rounded with a good texture, this is a wine that has a good future. It has weight, fruit that is fresh and well wooded showing plenty of spice and bright acidity.
Earthy aromas of tilled soil, underbrush, leather, purple flower, cedar and ripe black-skinned berry lead the way on this delicious blend of 85% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% Petit Verdot. The smooth full-bodied palate doles out juicy blackberry, red currant, licorice, exotic spice, mocha and a hint of game while tightly knit but velvety tannins lend both structure and finesse. It's already compelling but give it time to fully develop. Drink 2018–2027.
A heavy, extracted Pinot Noir, with baked cherry and blackberry flavors and lots of new oak. Feels a little tired. Drink up.
Blended with 25% Grenache, this is an enjoyable wine with notes of peppery spice and plum. It's all about mouthfeel, light fruit flavors and citrusy acidity.
This is a full-bodied yet succulent, supple wine, loaded with dark fruit. Black cherries and plums hint at sur-maturité, framed in a soft wrap of baking spices and mocha. Drink now–2020.
Ripe to the point of raisiny, with sugary currant, cherry-pie filling and root beer flavors, this Merlot lacks balance.
Sun-ripened bramble and dried herbs lend a savory rusticity to this spry yet decadently ripened Cabernet Franc. It's not a brawny wine, but powerful in impact, full of black fruit flavors and jolted by veins of fine tannin and pert acidity. It's lovely now, but structured enough to continue to improve till at least 2020.
This sensational blend of 50% Grenache, 25% Syrah, 20% Carignan and 5% Cinsault displays knockout aromas of black cherry and cassis alongside asphalt and black olive. It's an intense and compelling mix of fruity and savory, with a long, mouthwatering finish.
From Bodegas Navajas, this basic Rioja shows savory barbecued aromas along with brambly fruit notes, while the flavor profile veers toward red fruits and tomato leaf. Light in terms of mouthfeel, with some finishing oak flavor. A fresh sort of wine.
Winemaker Dan Lee selected lots of Chardonnay so rich on their own, they didn't need oak. And you'll hardly miss that barrel influence with all the intensely concentrated tropical fruit, nectarine, green apple and vanilla flavors. Shows a freshness that captivates now.
Youthfully bold, fruit-forward and slightly jammy, Sacred Hill's flagship Merlot offers bright cherries, but avoids being a one-trick pony by folding in subtle tea-leaf complexities and wonderfully silky tannins. Drink now–2017.
Here's a delicious expression that's made from organically farmed fruit. It opens with aromas of acacia flower, honey and exotic fruit. The palate offers rich pineapple and creamy almond pastry flavors that are brightened by refreshing acidity.
Herbal hints of fynbos and white-floral accents frame the bright clementine-fruit core of this wine. Subtle notes of hay and toast add depth to the otherwise brisk and lively palate. This is well-balanced and drinking beautifully now.
This Zin has candied, fruit punch flavors of cherries, licorice, raisins, brown sugar and cinnamon. It's a robust wine, mouthfilling and heady, that's best paired with barbecue.
Though better than the 2006, this shows no varietal character; it's charmless and empty. Acid and alcohol, with a lightly lemony middle; it could be anything.
Nicely rendered Chard at a reasonable price, this easy-to-drink wine keeps the oak influence understated, bolstering its pear, melon and pineapple fruit with subtle shadings of spice and toast. Clean and fresh on the finish.
A well-named wine from vintner Steve Anglim, this blend of 33% Grenache, 33% Syrah, 33% Mourvèdre and 1% Viognier is indeed great, with aromas of licorice, pencil lead, iron, black raspberry, black pepper and a touch of tobacco smoke. The palate is powered by boysenberry, cracked pepper, a touch of asphalt and then a very lifting wild-mint character.
Pretty much a copy of the '03, which I found too ripe and Porty. Although the wine is dry, it has raisiny flavors, with a stewed fruit, prune and chocolate pie crust quality. Actually tastes hotter than the official alcohol reading of 14.5%.
This is an expertly balanced wine from Temecula, showcasing region's potential for Grenache. Rosewater, cherry juice and cherry blossom aromas are lifted by herbal touches of marjoram and crushed peppercorn. Fennel, thyme and oregano flavors kick off the palate, where strong acidity carries raspberry and red berry flavors into a complex and elegant finish.
Considered by many as the finest of the Grand Crus, Les Clos is steep, south-facing and impressive just to look at. Like many wines from this vineyard, this wine has immense power and concentration. It is rich, dense and full of tight but rich yellow and green fruits shot through with intense acidity. It is still very young and needs to be aged. Drink from 2019.
Once again the best of the Zins from Angel Vine (formerly Three Angels), this has raspberry and cherry fruit, clean and vibrant, with good acidity and ripe tannins. There is a slight hint of green leaf and herb, just enough to add a bit of flavor interest.
Apple and citrus fruit carries a light and refreshing hint of wintergreen. This is a solid, fruity, no-frills, chillable style of Chardonnay.
This leads with bright aromas of orange blossom, just-ripe red apple and firm nectarine. The medium-weight palate offers ample acidic lift that complements the apple and citrus flavors. Though the finish is short, it's clean, and the wine is just so easy to like and drink. Enjoy now.
Crisp in fresh acids, with a leesy flavor and texture. The fruit veers toward tart citrus fruits, candied apples, and metallic minerals. Finishes with a lime-skin bitterness.
Here's a portly offering, and then some. Talk about a dark, soft, meaty wine. This one is so rich, ripe and loaded with black plums and berries that it's almost sleepy. But fierce tannins and lasting espresso darkness keep it going. Very good but heavier than the excellent 2001.
Aromas of spring blossom and green apple lift out of the glass. Silky and bright, the off-dry palate presents ripe pear, white peach and candied nectarine zest alongside a creamy mousse and fresh acidity.
Very deep color, potent aromas and a dense, but velvety texture paint a bold picture for this full-bodied wine. It has the drama and flavor recalling an expensive red, without overpowering tannins or a high price.
This is a structured wine, still with its tannins intact. It has a firm, dry character, the dark cherry fruit still developing. It is a dense wine with a future. Drink from 2018.
This is quite a hefty young Chard. It takes the basic elements of ripe, potent fruit, oak, and Burgundian-inspired technique and elevates it all, a Chard on steroids. The peach, tropical fruit, pear, candied ginger and charry oak flavors have an acidic scour. Drink now and for the next 5 years.
Sage-tinted cedar and black cherry combine in this proprietary blend of 61% Cabernet Sauvignon, 13% Sangiovese, 13% Syrah and 13% Zinfandel, from the producer's estate vineyard. Lean and refined, it shares a generosity of chocolate on the palate, with a slight spiciness to the finish.
San Rustico consistently makes some of the best Amarone available in the United States market. This shows fine qualities of blackberry, chocolate and tobacco, and a polished, silky mouthfeel.
The nose on this white from Greece is cheerful and alluring, with its waves of citrus and flowers. On the palate, the wine offers more than just fun—it's an elegant balance of robust and refreshing, with flavors of mandarin orange, lemon and spice shot through with a dancing acidity. Approachable but complex.
Tastes sugary sweet, with a spritzy feeling like a sparkling wine and simple flavors of raspberries and vanilla. Technically, it's a flawed wine, but millions of people will love it.
Hews closely to the Dutschke style: Full and soft, with slightly jammy dark cherry-berry notes accented by cedar and Mexican chocolate. This is a velvety, immediately accessible Shiraz for relatively early drinking, delivered at a remarkably fair price.
This rounded wine has spice, lychee and pineapple flavors. It is light, bright and fruity with a pepper aftertaste, and is ready to drink.
Creamy soft fruit, with the richness of 2005, hinting at some toast flavors. This wine is the second label from the Conti family, owners of Château Tour des Gendres, by far the best producer in Bergerac. It is a rounded, full wine, with fine, ripe white fruits, pears and nectarines, topped with light acidity.
This medium-bodied, silky blend should drink well through at least 2018. Despite the soft texture, it's made in a savory style, with notes of leather, roasted meat and ground spices backed by just enough cherry and plum fruit.
The Ovide blend stands out for its round, sweet cherry fruit, enhanced with the earthy, composty richness of biodynamically farmed wines. This new vintage has more power – more oomph – than the 2005, and should develop well over the next decade or so.
For the first release of this wine, the oak unfortunately is almost completely overwhelming. Vanilla, green wood, mocha and mint overpower almost any sense of varietal aroma and flavor.
There's lots of rich, jammy blackberry, cherry and oak flavor in this Merlot, with a gentle scour of firm tannins. It's not an ager, but offers plenty of upfront pleasure for drinking now.
This is dark in color, with full plum, berry, leather and mild chocolate aromas. Tobiano delivers a medium-to-full body, with ample stuffing and flavors of dark plum, oak and spice. This shows a smooth finish, controlled oak and good body weight. Drink now–2015.
Lots of acidity in this Pinot, maybe too much, as it gives a sour edge to the sweet raspberries and cherries. The end result is candied cough drop. Decant before serving.
What Baumard describes as a “secret blend” from its vineyards, this wine is both sweet and fresh. Honey and intense acidity are filled out with baked apple and lemon-marmalade flavors. It is ready to drink in all its fresh glory.
This delightful wine exhibits crisp acidity and Riesling's characteristic petrol, citrus, lychee and honeysuckle flavors. It's slightly off dry with a clean edge of minerality.
From an estate-grown, valley-floor vineyard on the southern edges of the winery property, this wine is complex and nuanced in berry pie and a satchel of dried herb. Sizable tannins—which show promise to be tamed with time—form the integrated structure, supporting a lengthy, mocha-chocolate finish. Cellar through 2020.
Chewing gum, dry wood and generic berry aromas precede an honest palate with modest tannins. Slightly herbal black-fruit flavors are peppery but nonspecific. A steady but chunky finish is the final act.
Seductive and irresistible, Campo del Drago offers abundant density, richness and flavor. This hearty Brunello is bursting with cherries, blueberries, spice and milk chocolate. It's a modern, hedonistic wine with chewy density and a smooth, creamy texture.
There's a slight bit of pleasant funk to the nose of this appellation blend, as well as graphite, sour cherry, soy and shiitake mushroom aromas. The palate is wound around tight acidity, with wild raspberry flavors lifted by incense and pine forest elements.
This is a crisp herbal wine, bright with acidity and marked with lemon and grapefruit tastes. It is light and bright with a mineral edge that gives it a fine texture. Drink now.
A mix of peach and lychee aromas give an exotic edge. Full in body and fleshy, this is endowed with concentrated flavors and tense acids.
Plum and currant aromas are gaseous at first, then minerally. This is tight, high in acidity and tannic. Rubbery, lightly briny cherry and plum flavors are held together by firm acidity, while this feels tight and wiry late, with herbal notes and tannic grab.
Aromas of rose, crushed herb, red berry and a balsamic note take shape in the glass. Elegant, fresh and poised, the palate offers black raspberry, red cherry baking spice and a hint of licorice framed in youthful but polished tannins. Drink 2020–2028.
There's great intensity here with bright aromas of cherry, spice, apple skin and chocolate. The wine is dark and persistent with mature, jammy fruit flavors in the mouth. Pair it with pepper-encrusted steak. —M.L.
This bottling from the Kathryn Hall family of wines is rich and juicy but not sweet at all. The nose begins with sage, clove, black cherry, concentrated violets and rose petals, with a turned-loam quality. The palate shows beets, fennel, sagebrush, dark red cherry and plum. A eucalyptus and menthol quality rises on the finish.
This slowly reveals subdued aromas suggesting ripe black-skinned fruit, scorched soil, violet, dark spice and a hint of espresso. The palate is on the lean side, with a sprinkling of clove, white pepper and a coffee note adding interest to the core of dried black cherry. Dusty tannins grip the close.
This is a firmly tannic wine although with ripe potential. It has a dense character that is good, allowing the fruit to develop. For now, it is dry so give that fruit plenty of time. Drink from 2019.
Ripe on the attack, with flavors of fleshy, yellow stone fruit and marmalade, this voluptuous yet dry Riesling is balanced, with layers of crushed stone and slate-driven minerality. Tart, citrusy acidity sends a sunny shockwave to your senses.
There is a yeasty rounded freshness on the nose. The palate is also pervaded by pleasantly creamy fresh yeast notes. Again, this is about texture rather than power. This is made from one of the few vineyards of Chasselas, a rather neutral variety, that still exists in Alsace. It's a light-bodied wine made for the table and, dare I say it, for quenching thirst.
So many things make this Chardonnay worthwhile. It's bone dry, low in alcohol, vibrant in acidity and minerally, which all give it a compelling delicacy and interest. Yet it's also intense and sweet in Meyer lemon fruit, with a touch of orange peel. If there's a criticism, it's that the oak is obvious, but that's a minor criticism.
This is from a tremendous vineyard site near the top of the appellation, situated from 1,250 to 1,800 feet. It incorporates small additions of Zinfandel and Carignane into the whole, a picture of soft beguiling violet aromas that are followed by a velvety texture and underlying grip of tannin. Rich red fruit and a taste of licorice linger on the intense finish.
Combines Syrah's blackberries and Grenache's raspberries to produce an intensely fruity wine. It's dry and smoothly textured, with soft tannins and acids. Delicious with spicy broiled chicken.
This is reminiscent of a very well-done fruit cocktail. Grape. melon and pear mingle amongst citrus freshness with some tropical hints of lychee mixed in. Wonderfully fruity, rounded and fresh with a zesty seam of acidity.
This Merlot is very fruity and forward with persistent berry jam, cassis, anise and mocha flavors. Although the tannins are brisk, it's a wine to drink now.
Winemaker Joel Aiken was lucky enough to source fruit from this famous Napa Valley appellation, and its mountain origins show in both the intensity of flavors and of tannins. The fruit is remarkably concentrated in cassis, with a tangy minerality that must come from the soil. New French oak, with its tannins and sweet toast, has been perfectly applied. The wine is vital, harmonious and young. Give it 10 or 15 years to begin to come around.
This traditional Lacryma Christi del Vesuvio is very thin and compact in the mouth with sour tones of white cherry, cranberry and bitter forest berry. It has bright acidity and would pair well with easy foods like bite-size pizzas or finger foods.
A ripe, soft wine, which has a pleasant touch of spicy wood. It is fat and full-bodied, with flavors of apricots and honey. Perhaps not as focused as Condrieu from a cooler vintage than 2003, it is likely to develop over 4-5 years.
86-88 Barrel sample. Hugely tannic, and somewhat rustic, this is dark, dense and very tough. Its tannins are totally dominant, giving the wine a hard edge.
This full-bodied wine is rich with tropical fruit as well as a more citrus character. It's ripe, packed with apples, apricots and then cut with acidity. There is a cool, fresh aftertaste.
Full, ripe fruit, flavored with green plum skins and gooseberries. There's great fresh acidity, but there is also a good structure suggesting the wine will age another year. Attractive weight as well.
Peppery and stemmy, with a wintergreen tartness that suggests unevenly ripened grapes. The berry-cherry flavors are diluted. Still, it's a clean, dry wine at a decent price.
This is from the talented team at Foley, a Rhône blend of Syrah, Cinsault and Grenache. Pale in color, the wine is extremely dry, with high acidity and nuanced flavors of rose petals, dried herbs, grapefruit zest and dusty white pepper. One of the best rosés of the vintage, it's terrific with bouillabaisse.

Generous and fragrant aromas of sweet fruit, peach, melon and a dusty mineral note are derived from the Cortaccia and Magrè chalk gravel vineyards in Alto Adige. Lean and crisp in the mouth, this is one of those drink-anytime wines that pairs with a long list of foods.
An oaky specimen that starts with maple syrup aromas, but it soon finds darker aromas of coffee, lemony oak and leather. This feels feels grippy and firm, with solid tannins and spicy, lightly herbal flavors of cassis and black plum. Dry and spicy on the finish, with a coffee-like bitterness.
The Chartrons is the neighborhood of Bordeaux where the wine merchants traditionally worked. This branded Bordeaux is softly ripe, with an attractive density along with a dry core of tannins. Ready to drink now.
Sweet and jammy in youth, with robust flavors of raspberry and cherry jam. The sweetness is balanced by crisp acidity and firm tannins, as well as a minerality that must come from the terroir. A feminine wine, Calera's '08 Jensen should gain in the bottle over the next eight years or so.
Try as we might to rally around this four-grape blend, things just aren't coming together. The nose is dry, cheesy and loses clarity with exposure to air, and while it's juicy and lively, it's also a common type of wine with high acidity and a spiky feel. The blend is 80% Cabernets Sauvignon and Franc and 20% Carignan and Carmenère.
High alcohol gives this wine a jalapeño-pepper heat, while extremely ripe grapes bring the blackberry and cherry flavors over the line into currants, raisins and prunes. An extreme, but classic, example of its superripe style.
With its ripe acidity, this is a wine that is ready to drink. It shows strong Cabernet Sauvignon ripeness, with a structure that is now soft and generous, along with cushioned tannins and an opulent feel. This is a wine to savor.
This straightforward Dolcetto has red berry and spice aromas and raspberry jam, clove and orange zest flavors. With its flexible tannins, it's ready to be enjoyed soon.

There's a tonic, soda quality to this wine that is backed by notes of apricot, almond and butterscotch. It has some sweetness in the mouth and flavors that recall chamomile tea and honey.
This ultraripe, happy Cab Franc bursts on the scene with jammy blackberry and prune aromas. The mouthfeel is lush, almost syrupy. Flavors of ultraripe blackberry, cassis and loamy earth finish warm, lusty and with chocolate and coffee notes.
The wine offers an intriguing nose of wildflowers, toasty oak and spice, followed by red berry, leather and red berry on the palate. Balanced and well structured with a good, long finish, the wine is suited to beef or lamb dishes.
Masaréj is Castello del Poggio's top expression of Barbera d'Asti, but this vintage shows warm characteristics of earth, smoked bacon, bresaola, prunes and plums. It doesn't seem to have what it takes for long aging, so drink up.
Aromas of mature berry, menthol, licorice, cooking spice and a balsamic note lead the nose. The firm palate is still tightly wound but already offers wild cherry, white pepper, grilled herb, tobacco and anise. It's balanced and fresh, with ripe but youthfully bracing tannins. Drink after 2019.
Here's a light and informal Ripasso that opens with bright berry tones, forest floor, mesquite wood and cedar. The wine's consistency is thin and bright and there are sour cherry flavors at the end.
Very ripe in blackberries, cherries, cassis, licorice and smoky oak, with deep, long flavors that are sweet in fruity essence. Already throwing some sediment, but still a very tannic wine, brooding and astringent. Needs a good six years, and could go the distance.
Broad, welcoming aromas of strawberry and baked red currant are lifted by mint leaf, star anise and white pepper on the nose. Pure raspberry flavors kick-start the palate, followed by waves of anise, bay leaf and juniper, proving this to be a dynamic and minty sip.
This Pinot Gris has a lot of character. The color shows a slight suggestion of pink (it comes from a gris or semi-colored grape after all), the flavors are like white peach, the balance is fresh and crisp, and the aftertaste is tangy. It's a very versatile lunch or dinner wine.
Fragrant with orange blossom and tart, tangerine-based fruit. The barely-perceptible residual sugar is listed at 0.53%. Solid winemaking by Lynn Penner-Ash, as usual.
It leads with dense aromas of black fruit, plum, spice and dried rose petals. The rich palate offers juicy black cherry and red raspberry accented with notes of white pepper, cinnamon clove and cocoa alongside bracing tannins. It closes on a note of black licorice. Drink 2020–2030.
Green aromas blend with coastal-influenced passion fruit, while the palate is driven by citrus, pineapple, passion fruit and some unfortunate canned vegetable flavors. Acidic and racy, but not much nuance or character. Shows the Leyda style of SB but not in blow-out form.
This shows the richness and power associated with Piña Cabernet, but is just a touch drier and more acidic than the winery's offerings from warmer parts of Napa. With blackberry, cassis and dark chocolate flavors that are wrapped into ample tannins, it's a wine that seriously wants at least 6–8 years in the cellar.
Expressive aromas of candied pineapple, apricot, tropical fruit and citrus are followed by rounded floral and fruit flavors on the tongue. A nice spicy lift keeps the wine aloft. Pair with salted nuts, cheeses.
Mint aromas and new wood flavors mark this smoothly ripe, polished wine. It has a good amount of black fruit, a dry but open texture and a rich, smoky character. The tannins and generous fruit power the wine forward.
There is an attractive lemon tang to this wine, as well as bright acidity and a creamy texture. It has plenty of fruit, and a sense of lightness that would make it a great apéritif.
This is one of the everyday drinking range from Schloss Gobelsburg. It has freshness, light green and white fruits and an exuberant burst of acidity. It is cool, green and a great apéritif style. Screwcap.
Rossana makes an ideal match to pizza or pasta with fresh tomato, a clove of garlic and chopped basil. The berry tones are bright and compact and there are light but polished tannins on the close. This lively wine is widely available in the United States.
94–96. Barrel sample. Now incorporating the Magdelaine vineyard, Bélair-Monange is a fine, complex wine, dense and just austere. The wine is firmly in the tannic style—dark and brooding.
Round and accessible, this is another easy-drinking wine from Rosemount. Blackberry, plum and dried spice flavors are varietally correct and displayed on a couch of soft tannins.
The off-dry version of Vaugondy's Vouvray brings out ripe apple as well as pineapple and lemon flavors. It is still crisp, packed with acidity, rounded out with finishing sweetness.
This wine incorporates fruit from Klipsun, Cold Creek and the estate vineyard (among others). It's the first time grapes from Col Solare's vineyard have been included in the blend. It bears ripe black-cherry and cassis flavors, and it has the acid-tannin balance that will allow it to evolve. At the moment, the finish seems unresolved, and it turns chalky.
Aromas suggest citrus, acacia flower, and hints of vanilla and honey. The creamy palate offers Bartlett pear, sage and lemon drop brightened by fresh acidity.
Made with full-throttle Burgundian techniques, with barrel fermentation in lots of new oak and sur lie aging applied to fat, juicy berries, to judge from their ripe, jammy fruitiness. Bursts with apricot, Meyer lemon, pineapple, guava, date, fig and smoky flavors. A bit over-wrought.
This 100% Vranac is garnet in color, with aromas of black cherry and black plum. It conveys flavors of fresh cherry juice and freshly sliced black plum, with a touch of pleasant astringency in the finish.
Horsey aromas of pine and juniper come with a blanket of oak that gives off lactic, plastic scents. Pinched, clamping and rubbery on the palate, this tannic blend of Garnacha, Cabernet Franc and Syrah tastes herbal, briny and saucy, with briary berry, salt and reprise of juniper on the finish.
This fruit-driven white blend is powered by Roussanee, which showcases its hallmark pineapple fruit. Hints of honey and pear add a bit of nuance, but this easy-drinking, medium- to full-bodied wine remains pretty straightforward.
Coming from one of the state's top Syrah vineyards, this wine offers aromas of herb, stem, flower, smoked meat and marionberry that are followed by a velvety palate redolent with fruit and savory flavors. It delivers a lot of enjoyment and sophistication.
Wood-aged Sauvignon Blanc is always a difficult balancing trick. This wine, the top cuvée from Château de Sancerre, doesn't quite make it, with the spicy wood dominating the lighter fruit. The hints of fruit suggest pears and pink grapefruit, but always the wood intervenes.
This is a beautiful wine at an very attractive price. It's redolent of blueberry, dried mint, cola, almond and forest berry.
This new release from Melrose fills the mouth with flavor; it runs from orange blossom to Meyer lemon to candied pineapple, finally settling into a strong citrus/tropical blend of delicious fruit flavors. It seems to strike a perfect balance, staying lively and well-defined, without becoming hot or bitter.
The nose of this bottling is both floral and savory, blending roasted beef with lilacs and a creamy boysenberry mousse. The palate is cohesive and pleasant, with dark berries, a touch of roasted game and more purple-flower petals, carried by a persistent acidity.
Brunello di Montalcino is celebrated for its amazing capacity to age gracefully. This Riserva has done just that and pours beautifully: Blackberry, espresso, licorice, tar and cola are integrated seamlessly with vanilla, toast and campfire tones. It is velvety, yet firm in the mouth with a long, long licorice-driven finish.
An interesting Zin that attracts for its range of sweet fruit and dried herb flavors. The cherries, blackberries and raspberries have complex interweavings of thyme and lavender, leaving the palate to discover new sensations with every sip. Finishes dry and smoothly tannic.
Smooth and polished, this shows real Napa character, with dry tannins framing blackberry, black currant and herb flavors. It doesn't seem to be built for aging, so open it over the next year or two.
Leather and spice are the more appealing aromas, while the palate features tightly wound but limited raspberry and red berry flavors. A narrow wine with snap, acidity and tartness but not much wealth or richness.
The nose is blowsy and dusty, with waxy white-fruit aromas. The palate is juicy and fresh but doesn't offer much body. Finishing flavors of nectarine, papaya and orange are basic.
Tight and taut from the get-go, time in the glass not resolving the thick woody tannins that envelop the plum and blackberry fruit that lies beneath. Anise, curry spice and bread flour does come to the fore, though. Add a backbone of lively acidity to this picture and the result is a wine that'll shine much more in 2009 than it does now. 59% Cabernet, 19% Merlot, 15% Cab Franc, 7% Malbec. Imported by Boutique International.
Round and full-bodied, this has a spice note and a perfumed, floral character. The wine is bright, still rather tight, needing a few months to develop.

Here is a ripe wine from a fine vintage in Cahors. With touches of spice as well as rich black-currant fruits, the wine is all about its fruitiness and acidity—ably assisted by tannins. The aftertaste just keeps the fruit coming.

A lightly textured wine that has spice, pineapple and baked apple flavors. It is medium dry and fruity with a zesty orange peel texture. Drink this wine now, or keep it until 2015.
Dark and tarry at first, then more red and floral as it opens. It shows snappy acidity and fresh, herbal-tasting plum, cherry and berry flavors along with some cocoa and spice. Fades fast on the finish, leaving a mild acidic burn.
Spicy and fruity, this is a refreshing, open, green and white fruited wine. Lively and crisp, it has good acidity and just a touch of pepper to add another dimension. Screwcap.
Plush and modern, plump and decadent: this is a blockbuster Brunello with huge concentration, density and intensity especially where those oak-related aromas are concerned. Yes, you get loads of spice and mesquite wood here but the natural intensity of the cherry and blackberry is not overwhelmed. The wine is soft, chewy and dense in the mouth. Drink after 2014.
Pristine black cherry and plum flavors are layered in swathes of savory dried herbs, char and coffee on this bold, big-bodied red. Juicy red-fruit flavors are unabashedly forward on the palate, but reined in with a shower of revitalizing acidity. It finishes with soft tannins.
This sparkler, made from from 100% Chardonnay, shows aromas of oak, stone fruit and citrus. The palate offers toast, peach and citrus flavors along with oak sensations. It's vigorously sparkling and ends on a note of walnut.
A currant flavor pushes this wine to a rich, concentrated fruitiness. It is dry, although the superripe fruit gives an illusion of sweetness. The concentration and density of the fruit are impressive. Screwcap.
This is a second wine from Amici Cellars. It's rich and forward with cherry, blackberry, licorice and mocha flavors that taste fruity-sweet, but finish dry. Elegantly constructed, it's a polished wine to drink now.
Although the aromas of cassis, spiced blackberry, maduro and dried herb are restrained on first sniff, with some air and coaxing they become more assertive. The medium-bodied palate has a pliant core, and the tightly coiled tannins come alive on the finish.
A good value in dry Riesling, this bottling features potent petrol, truffled honey and pineapple notes on the nose, while on the palate it's medium bodied, turning crisp and lean on the finish.
Classic spice and red fruits from this attractive, generous Blanfränkisch. Made to be drunk young, it is already soft, juicy and fruity, with great freshness from acidity.
Your first impression is of a rich, well-structured, important Cabernet. It impresses with ripe, cassis-laced fruit and lush, sweet tannins. Oak provides seasoning, but doesn't dominate this dry, elegant Cab. Drink now through 2010.
At first pass, this feels a little tired, with a somewhat feeble nose and flavors that could tend toward bitter. But in the mouth, the wine impresses—the fruit is pretty and round, the mouthfeel smooth. Spice and fruit come together nicely and chase away any austerity that may be lurking. The finish is good and layered.
With 11,000 cases imported, this crisp, clean Steen should be easy to find and well worth the price. Light weight but filled with ripe pineapple and Key lime flavors accented by crushed white flowers. Drink now.
Light cherry fruit is quickly overtaken by the tannins, and this wine has a sharp, high-toned edge. Quite dry and bordering on sourness in the finish, it's a modest effort from a difficult year.
Tiny amounts of Merlot and Petit Verdot were added to this succulent, elegant wine with cassis, cranberry and black cherry flavors and rounded structure. A light note of cocoa dust and soft texture balance its exotically spiced lushness with delicious integration.
The vineyard is planted with a density of 8000 plants per hectare, reducing yields but increasing intensity. With enormous concentration, it is super-rich but not quite over the top. Yellow fruits are the evident hallmark here, with pineapple acidity and a dash of pepper. Age for at least five years. Screwcap. Imported by Michael Skurnik Wines. Cellar Selection.
Refreshing, lively, this Pinot Gris starts with aromas of grapefruit and lemon and leads into zesty flavors of white pepper, lemon and grapefruit. A touch acidic, the wine could use more fruit balance, but overall an enjoyable dry white choice.
One of the few in California to use this grape, winemaker Ryan Pease makes a great case for more in this bottling, which shows broad lemon curd, soft apple flesh and Anjou pear on the nose. There is ripe stone fruit on the tangy palate, but it's bone dry and grippy with chalky texture.
Like the '05 release, Castle's 2006 is sugary-sweet, with peach and pineapple jelly flavors that taste more like a dessert wine than one for the main course.
A surprisingly strong effort, Ogier's Heritage Blanc shows some intriguing notes of orange and mushroom on the nose, then follows up with plenty of heft on the palate and a long, citrusy finish. Drink it over the next several months.
This warm expression of Nebbiolo opens with aromas of stewed prunes, resin and raisin. The palate offers plums steeped in spirits and espresso alongside green wood tannins that generate an abrupt finish.
Rich gold in color. Broad, layered aromas of very ripe fruit with hints of sweet smoke, brown sugar, honey and a savory earthy minerality. Full-bodied, bone dry, but richly textured with crisp acidity and a wide palette of flavors, ripe stone fruit, a creamy savory earthiness, sage and a balsamic kick on the finish. Very long length, slightly warm but with a lingering savory, mineral finish.
Tough, vegetal, tannic and raspingly dry, and not going anywhere. A huge disappointment. Tasted twice.
This Mediterranean blend of Syrah and Grenache is soft and open. It has the lightest touch of tannin, adding texture to its blackberry fruit and crisp acidity. It finishes with an attractive perfumed character.
This barrel-fermented Sauvignon Blanc will appeal to fans of oak. It's strong in charry, caramelized, buttered toast flavors that dominate the underlying wine, and make it taste a little sweet.
Ripe in juicy blackberry and cherry flavors, with an edge of sweet dried herbs and some oak, this polished Cab is soft and gentle. Has enough acidity to keep it brisk.
Full in the mouth, this is a rich, wood-lifted wine, the peach and apricot fruits given an edge by a light steeliness. The acidity fits well into the rich flavors here, creating a burst of apple juice over the yellow fruits. Imported by Louis Latour Inc.
Syrupy and tired. Not much going on with this raspberry-flavored Zin.
Made in the popular style, this Chardonnay has ripe fruit flavors of pineapples, limes and mangoes, and strong oak notes of vanilla and buttered toast.
This is the ripest of Ojai's current trio of '08 Chardonnays, with tropical fruit, apricot and pear flavors, but it also shows the winery's telltale acidity, dryness and minerality. Drink now.
Husky on the nose but mostly it comes across as wild, with jumpy, loud pear, melon and apple aromas. The mouth is spunky and all over the map, while flavors of tangy yellow fruits carry an acidic, herbal twinge and even a grassy quality. Lacks perfect poise but it can't be called timid or dull.
Flavors of ripe blackberry, cola and mulberry stand out in this dry, elegant Cab. The tannins are thick but the wine isn't likely to improve with age, so drink soon.
Structured with tight, dry tannins, this has a definite edge of austerity. The fruit is red berry, with cranberry dryness, showing a layer of pure juice and obvious acidity. The finish is long and smoky, with the acidity subsumed into tannins.
This is ripe, fruit-driven Shiraz with ample weight and ripeness. Hints of smoke and sage add nuance to the blueberry and black cherry fruit, while coarse-grained tannins provide adequate structure and grip. Drink now–2022.
Deep pink in the glass, this wine has a nose of strawberries and freesia. It is full in the mouth, with flavors of strawberry, tart cranberry, bitter almond and lavender. Soft but ever-present tannins are felt through the tart but pleasant finish.
A tasty, reserved Shiraz with compact, briary dark fruit and spicy accents.  Very solid and well-structured at this price, this shows much more restraint than usually seen in this price range. Not at all jammy, it's attractively understated, an elegant affordable red.
This wine carries fairly broad fruit flavors of mixed red fruits, along with leaf and earth. Tannins are well managed; the finish light and fruity.
Another fine vintage for this Wahluke Slope vineyard. A sophisticated and muscular Cabernet Franc, with smooth and smoky flavors of mixed blackberries and black currants. The blend is 88% Cab Franc, 6% Syrah, 4% Merlot and 2% Cab Sauvignon, and it opens into a pretty nose with sweet grain and clover accents, runs into ripe, powerful fruit, and finishes with a kiss of clove.
The nose blends overtly floral, fruity lead aromas with secondary notes of shoe polish and leather, but in the end it's a little mute. The mouth offers standard plum and berry flavors, while the mouthfeel is chunky and generally quite pure. This is not a thoroughbred, but it's more than a good plow horse.
Inviting aromas of toasted almond, pear and a whiff of chopped herb lead the nose on this linear white. The lively palate offers crisp apple, nectarine zest and flinty mineral accompanied by bright acidity.
This blend of Zinfandel, Syrah and Sangiovese shows dense, dark notes of chocolate, boysenberry, leather, lavender and a sprig of mint on the nose. The tannins are chalky in texture, with a balance of blueberries and menthol tones.
This is a textbook example of a mineral-driven wine, with lemon and apple aromas along with touches of hay and corn. It feels fresh, citrusy and tight, with citrus flavors leading to a pithy, tangy finish. Crisp and cleansing.
Just a bit too hot and sharp, although in its favor it is dry and shows a thoughtful balance. The cherries and blackberries have a nice earthy richness.
This expression of Nero d'Avola delivers loads of spice, cherry, leather, tobacco and prune. It has a meaty, slightly chunky consistency, and layers of sweet succulence on the close.
Spicy, slightly volatile, with smooth plum and chocolate flavors across the palate. There's some lift from the VA, and then the silky tannins carry it along for a very pleasant ride. It just lacks the extra bit of depth that would ramp it up to the next decile.
La Bandina is a bold, oak-driven blend that opens with sweet notes of spice, vanilla, campfire and tons of berry fruit and mature cherry. It tastes plush and rich in the mouth: This is by no means your standard Valpolicella.
Forward and nicely rounded off, this brings spicy cherry and cranberry fruit front and center. There are well-integrated streaks of herb, a dash of stem, and a dusting of white pepper. Give it an hour or two to breathe, or better yet, decant before drinking.
Herbal notes of bark and soft spice mingle with red cherry and plum fruit aromas and flavors. This is bright and accessible now thanks to approachable tannins and a clean, easygoing finish.
This is a perfumed wine that's concentrated and full of white fruit, pineapple and kiwi. It has a cool, mineral character lending both freshness and a rich backdrop. It could well age for 2–3 years. Screwcap.
This is a heavy, bitterly tannic young wine that shows ripe blackberry and coffee flavors and spices. The raw astringency makes it tough now, fit only for greasy foods like barbecued ribs. It should age well for a long time, but will never quite overcome its rustic profile.
So rich and ripe in fruit, you almost don't notice that it's also a complicated and layered wine in structure. Blackberry marmalade, cassis and cocoa flavors are balanced despite hefty alcohol. An extraordinarily delicious wine, but it's meant to be enjoyed in its youth. Drink up by 2016.
Quite a good wine. It's luscious in creamy flavors of blackberries, cherries and toast, and also beautifully balanced. You feel the elegant interplay of oak, tannins and acidity. Should develop over the next 6–8 years.
This barrel-fermented white wine from Jesse Katz of Devil Proof and Aperture Wines is impressively layered and complex. A reductive whiff of petrol leads on the nose yet the palate is juicy, showing a wealth of peach skin and green apple. A bite of acidity supports its fresh, fruity core.
High acidity and soft tannins mark this flavorful red, an unusual blend of Tempranillo and Grenache. It's a little on the sweet side, but the raspberry, cherry, mocha and oak flavors are delicious.
Aromas of hay, tomato leaf and medicinal herb lead the nose and follow over to the racy palate together with grapefruit, lemon drop and mineral. It's linear, with bracing acidity.
A bit of a disappointment from this winery, but the flavors here seem a touch overripe, with pruny notes intruding into the blackberries. Obvious American oak marks the nose with herbal, dill-like notes and the finish with dry, woody tannins and caramel flavors. Imported by Supreme Wines & Spirits.
A delicious Merlot, drily tannic and rich in blackberries, cherries and chocolate. Nearly as good as the winery's much more expensive Reserve. Great with grilled steak with sautéed mushrooms.
This is absolutely delicious, with raspberry, cherry and mocha flavors that go on and on. Great Central Coast acidity provides needed tartness to balance the richness. It's a beautiful, ripe, flashy and sophisticated Pinot Noir, showing the early drinkability and freshness of the Edna Valley.
The local grape Castelão is blended with Cabernet Sauvignon in this soft, spicy and fruity wine. Red fruits and balanced acidity are given a shove by a lightly tannic structure. The wine is ready to drink.
Easily as good as Chardonnays costing two or three times as much, this is a great value, and with production at 12,000 cases, it should be fairly easy to find. It's rich in orange, apricot and buttered toast flavors, with balancing acidity and a dry finish.
A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Caberent Franc, this shows pungent green tones of rosemary, bay leaf and dried herb, followed by flavors of cherry, blackberry and nutmeg. The tannins are firm and polished, and the finish is bright and fresh.
This Chardonnay is a little heavy-handed on the butterscotch or caramel, top to bottom, but its citrus and mineral accents keep the toastiness in check. Offers yellow fruit on the palate and on the nose.
This medium-bodied wine has personality. It smells like pencil shavings, black tea and plums, and tastes like prunes and pomegranate juice, finishing with that same spicy, tea-like character. The texture is smooth and the balance is good.
Obviously from a superior terroir, this Pinot shows gorgeously ripe berry fruit and spices, brisk acidity, firm tannins and a rich coating of oak. But the parts haven't come together. It's like a team that needs practice. Should peak sometime in 2012, and hold for a couple years.
Aged entirely in large casks, this rich wine offers floral aromas with hints of exotic fruit and melon. The creamy palate delivers juicy Golden Delicious apple, pear and pear accented with a graphite note and baking spices alongside vibrant acidity.
This wine is made from the same barrels as the producer's Finch Hollow offering, using the wine from the top of the barrels and left unfined and unfiltered. The result is an ethereal experience, creamy and crisp in golden apple and nectarine, its body rich, round, lush and delightfully satisfying.
Menthol and pepper ride over dark cherry and spicy plum aromas. The palate is tight and restrained, offering dusty cherry and redcurrant flavors that succumb to an ultimately green, stemmy finish.
This wine gets going with aromas of grass, citrus and mineral. Next comes a chiseled palate, bearing tight, pure flavors of lime, pink grapefruit and green herb. It's elegant and has a minerally, just-long-enough finish.
A simple wine, dry and tart in acidity, with pleasant wild cherry, red currant, sweet licorice and bacon flavors. The blend is mainly Syrah, with a splash of Petite Sirah.
While not the most structured vintage of Beaucastel, this is a full-bodied, creamy-textured rendering of Châteauneuf-du-Pape. Finely detailed notes of plum, thyme and leather mark the nose, while the flavors are ripe almost to the point of jamminess. Drink now–2025.
This is a sharp-edged wine with green-tinged fruits—apples and pears not quite ripe. It pushes accents of herb and stem forward, and will probably drink best with food rather than on its own.
This vintage of Jago presents ripe cherry aromas that are well integrated against the wine's mass of spice, chocolate and tobacco. There's plush softness here and a long, fresh finish. Imported by Tellitalia Imports.
This is a particularly creamy wine that's ripe and fruity with only a light touch of acidity. It has a soft feel with notes of creamed apples that makes it a wine to drink now.
Blackberry aromas are touched up by graphite, char and herbal accents. This feels wide, with wall-to-wall tannins and extracted flavors of loam and earthy plum and blackberry. A lead-pencil note is reprised on the finish, which is tannic in feel and loaded with herbal black-fruit character.
Tastes extremely fruity, with peaches, apricots, lemonade, pineapple juice and all kinds of other stone fruit and spice flavors. This wine could use more acidity, though, as it's kind of flabby.
A lively, toasted spice nose rolls into friendly, flirty, light and balanced flavors on this Chardonnay. Balanced fruit and minerality and a curvy but fresh finish add to the appeal. An elegant wine with personality.
Ripe, full-bodied and delicious, this wine is big and bold, pushing the envelope with late harvest flavors, seeming sweet on the palate and the finish. It tastes like blackberry jam and dark chocolate. It would make a fine after-dinner drink, too.
Full and ripe, this wine is softly rich rather than mineral, but retains plenty of fresh, crisp green fruit flavors, touched with spice and pepper.
Generic white-fruit aromas feature apple and melon. It feels sharp as a razor, with citric acidity pushing lemon and sour peach flavors, finishing tart.
Young and dense, almost misleading in its soft fruitiness, but there's tremendous power, and despite the appearance of approachability, it would be a mistake not to cellar this wine. It's explosive in fruit and berry flavors, and the tannins are so melted, you could easily open it tonight. But this is a wine with proven ageability. Should begin to mature by 2010 and drink well through 2020, at least.
The ultra-steep Kirchberg de Barr vineyards can give ripe wines such as this from its great exposure. The wine has a ripe character, the yellow fruits cut through with lively acidity, a perfumed character. Fruity, likely to age over the next 3–5 years.
This dark red wine shows the brawniness and tannic hardness of a young Petite Sirah. It's bone dry and relatively modest in alcohol, but it lacks the richness and depth of flavor to enable it to age.
Intensely concentrated in black currants, cassis liqueur and oak aromas and flavors, this Cabernet is so strong, it's practically undrinkable now. It's not just the potent tannins and bright acidity, it's the raw, jammy quality of the fruit. All these elements could begin to come together after 2017.
This is done in a wide-open, instantly drinkable style that makes it an excellent, everyday quaffer. Young Oregon Pinots often need more time, but not this one. Strawberry, coffee and cola flavors combine into a broad and flavorful midpalate, fresh and inviting.
Citrus aromas, mostly lemon, veer towards dish soap. A spunky, citric mouthfeel is tight and exact. Nothing beyond citrus flavors are present on a cutting palate. Echoes of lime propel the finish.
This bright sparkler delivers the sophisticated flavors of fresh citrus and ripe apricot that one should expect in a metodo classico sparkler from Italy. Background notes of honey and baked bread give it dimension and texture.
Here's a savory selection, offering earthy and balsamic aromas of underbrush, tobacco and Mediterranean herbs. The restrained palate reveals ripe plum, cassis and licorice notes layered with chewy tannins and a warm midpalate.
The nose here shows clean pine and citrus notes, with accents of herb and tropical fruit. Straightforward apple, pear and nut flavors show on the palate. In some ways, including the nutty finish, the wine is good—in other ways, it's just there.
Slight flinty notes on the nose open up into flavors of ripe pear on the palate. Everything is toned by fresh citrus zest and a linear, taut body that holds ample refreshment. This is clean, zingy and slender and offers ultimate refreshment.
Is this a dessert wine or a table wine? It straddles the line. Let's call it off dry, with slightly sugared tangerine, apricot, vanilla bean and spice flavors that finish clean and zesty.
Meaty and roasted on the nose, with rubbery plum and blackberry aromas. This is a full-force wine with clacky, firm tannins and herbal flavors of cassis and dark berry. Finishes roasted, with an herbal character. Lively but coarse feeling.
This diluted wine opens with aromas suggesting old cut flowers and wet soil. The thin watery palate has just a hint of unripe sour cherry.
This is a soft, rounded and ripe wine. Attractive raspberry fruits are filled out with a light tannic character. The freshness and acidity do cut the full texture although perhaps not enough. Drink now.
Burnt and leathery on the nose, with basic olive, saline, cherry and plum flavors. Gritty and tannic, with some green qualities. Seems like a wine you've encountered many times before. Imported by American Wine Distributors.
Rich and structured, this shows the plushness of today's Bordeaux Merlot. Ripe berry fruits, dark plums and a touch of vanilla give spice and round off the texture. It's juicy, still developing and best from 2016.
A stenciled “A” on the bottle makes for some very handsome packaging. The wine inside the bottle is just as successful as its label, with savory aromas of cured meat and leather, backed by black fruit and Indian spice notes.
This easygoing red offers fruit-driven sensations of wild cherry, plum and accents of black pepper. On the palate, bright acidity supports the juicy fruit flavors. It's direct and clean, and will work nicely for informal occasions.
Big, ripe, fruity wine, very pure and fresh. The black currant fruits give richness, following through with some black chocolate flavors and dry tannins. It will develop quickly, and the fruit is already delicious.
Way too much oak on this rustic wine, and rather insipid, too, with its too-soft mouthfeel and slightly sweet, Lifesaver flavors.
Weighty and dry, Albariño is a rare sight in Sonoma. This one is well worth seeking, savory in nutty almond and a taste of grilled peach. Mouth quenching, it'll pair well with spicy Thai shrimp.
Milk chocolate, toast and raspberry aromas are followed by quite sweet fruit flavors. It's unabashed in its easy-drinking appeal.
Fruit flavors of pear and peach roll into a soft, spongy midpalate. The finish brings in fermentation flavors of cracker and sweet grain, with some skin phenolics.
Intense and smoky, this is an old-vine Zinfandel blended with Petite Sirah, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc. Although most of the grapes come from Lodi, smaller amounts hail from the Russian River Valley and Atlas Peak. Thick-walled and burly in licorice, earth and black and red berry fruit, it offers substantial texture and length. Not a wine for the meek.
Fresh and full of lime on the nose, and overall this is simple, smooth and gives you little reason to worry or fuss. The palate is smooth, creamy and a little low on acids, thus the lemon-lime and melon flavors have a fullness that's sweet and good.
Hailing from vines planted in 1918 when the Los Angeles area was the state's top vineyard zone, this bottling shows elegant blackberry meringue, lavender chiffon and hedonistic fudge on the nose. Purple flowers also show on the palate, as do Earl Grey tea, plum rinds and black-pepper notes.
Classy, sexy and certainly ageworthy. Dusty, meaty, peppery aromas lead to a palate rife with dark fruit and substantial oak. Supple in the mouth, with burly black fruit and wheat flour on the finish. Drink through 2012.
This fun blend of Barbera, Merlot and Albarossa drinks easily and would pair with a long list of foods including pasta, chicken and spicy ground beef. Aromas include cherry, blackberry, cola and chocolate and the wine's finish is smooth and soft.
Dark purple in color, the nose is oak-laden, with toasted vanilla, sawdust and coconut pervading. Medium to full bodied, the palate is dark and brooding featuring rich black fruit, extracted tannins and a cocoa-dusted finish.
Ripeness is evident in the wine's earthy nose, which blends prune, tire rubber and spice with good results. Serious and medium-bodied for Cabernet Sauvignon, with a cascade of red-berry flavors followed closely by a wave of dry oak and mocha. Shows some drying tannins and a peppery aftertaste. Drink now–2009.
The strawberry fruit shows a wild herbal side, with a touch of toasted grain. The tannins are firm and the finish carries a hint of chicken broth.
Very young and crisp, this is an example of New World sparkling wine that should prove ageable, if purchasers are so inclined. Shows some yeasty complexity to go with clove and tart green-apple flavors.
Starts off with aromas of green gage plum and hints of honey, but on the palate this is powerful and tightly coiled. It even seems a bit lean at this stage, with a bit of spritz, but expect it to improve markedly over the next 2–3 years. For now, the potential is all evident in the tremendous length on the finish.
This marvelous vineyard has not been featured by Elk Cove previously. The characteristic blackberry fruit shines through, but winemaker Adam Campbell has wrapped it in the sort of elegant, lightly herbal, spicy flavors that define the Elk Cove style. Perfectly ripened at 14.5% alcohol, this wine manages to be both fruity and complex, open and layered.
This light-bodied wine showcases the sometimes perfumed nature of Pinot Noir from Marlborough. Vanilla, cedar and mocha notes from oak maturation layer atop the delicate cherry fruit, finishing a bit dry. Drink it over the next few years, before the fruit fades.
Tight tannins dominate this highly scented wood-aged wine. It has rich blackberry flavors, spice and perfumed acidity. The juicy fruits are bright and will soften into the rich texture over the next few years. Drink from 2019.
Not quite as rich and balanced as in past vintages, the 2004 is a bit ordinary in blackberry and cherry flavors. The tannins are fairly powerful, and the wine, which clocks in at over 15% alcohol, feels hot and peppery.
Light and subtle, this offers tart cherry fruit with hints of mushroom. The texture and definition somewhat compensate for the overall lightness and lack of depth. It's a graceful, elegant wine best enjoyed young.
This is the winery's Cabernet Sauvignon-based Bordeaux blend, containing all five of the major Bordeaux grape varities. Superripe and high in alcohol, it lacks subtle complexity or ageworthiness. Forward jam, chocolate and oak flavors are undeniably delicious though.
A dry style of tawny, bringing out wood aging as well as rich mellow fruit. The wine has an old gold feel to it, with butter toffee, butterscotch and final acidity.
A microscopic amount of this wine was made, and it has spent time in bottle, currently revealing a floral, violet bouquet that ventures into almond and orgeat aromas. Vibrant and fresh on the palate, with a bite on the finish, it offers a strong grenadine-like taste.
Creamy bubbles pour from the bottle on this reliably solid sparkler, with aromas of Meyer-lemon zest, gray slate, wet concrete, crushed white rocks and a shade of nectarine. The palate is yeasty with sourdough elements dominant, alongside shreds of red apple, lemon juice and tangerine rinds.
This is an attractive, fruity, concentrated wine. It has a salty, mineral character that adds a tang to the ripe apple and lime fruits. With its lift of acidity, it is crisp and refreshing at the end.
Sizzling acidity lies beneath a density of ripe, smooth and rounded texture, the dusty flavors rich in black cherry, berry and dark chocolate.
This wine has structure, with ripe red fruits and a good layer of tannin. Despite a difficult year in Bordeaux, the Queyrens family created a balanced wine with the acidity showing brightly through the firm, still-young texture. It could do with a few more months of aging so drink from 2016.
bright sparkling wine made from Ribolla Gialla grapes, this has thick aromas of stone fruit, butterscotch and caramel. The finish is fresh, with creamy effervescence.
This vineyard is best known for its Merlot but this Cabernet keeps pace. It brings a mixture of fruit and barrel aromas of vanilla, blackberry, coffee, licorice and herbs. Flavors are sweet and rich, with coffee lingering on the finish.
From rocky estate soils, Terre Rouge's Viognier opens with delicious aromas of honeysuckle, mango and guava, lightly put together with a jolt of wet stone. Rich in mouthfeel, the finish is woodsy, like the finest herb garden.
Strange aromas of tree bark, pool water and funky berry fruit are not inviting. This organic Cabernet feels awkward and grabby, while flavors of jammy berry fruits finish flabby, wayward and with little charm.
Ripe, baked black-fruit aromas go heavy on the raisin and prune, with a hint of spice cake thrown in. On the palate, this is saturated and a bit thick. Baked berry, cassis and creamy oak flavors finish lush and chewy, with flavors of oak grain and chocolate. Drink now through 2020.
Comes down on the rustic side, but for the price it's pretty good for a dry Cabernet. Shows the variety's full-bodied fanciness in the blackberry, currant, cocoa and licorice flavors, with a rich steak of vanilla oak.
As per usual, Don Melchor is singing a pretty tune. Deep, dense aromas of floral berry fruits and tarry darkness are solid and complete. Pure, elegant and confident across the palate, this delivers firm cassis, plum and cherry flavors backed by a toasty finish accented by licorice. This is rich and brawny but not heavy; drink through 2023.
Aromas of light raspberry and cookie dough are a bit sweet, but taken together they are attractive. The palate delivers snappy berry flavors and plenty of tannic kick. It loses a touch of focus as it opens but at $10 it offers more than enough quality.
Give a good shot of air in a decanter to this Syrah before you pour it. Fresh out of the bottle, it's all candied cherry and black raspberry fruit. Oxygen will help soften it and bring out earthy, herbal complexities.
Starts with green drawn aromas and a backing of basic berry fruit. The palate is angular and intense, with lemony, high-toned flavors of generic cherry and berry. Finishes hard, tart and citric, with toughness.
Creamy and minty on the nose, with dark berry aromas that veer toward raisiny. The palate is generous, full, reduced and narrow, with raisin, blackberry and heavy spice flavors. An old-vines style of Monastrell that lumbers across the finish line with full ripeness and sweetness. Drink now.
With a pretty pink-salmon color, this Pinot Noir-based blush is rich and full-bodied. It has considerable weight for a bubbly, but the acidity and freshness and yeasty tang lift it up to Champagne elegance. Impossible not to fall in love with this raspberry-scented beauty, but why wouldn't you want to?
Soft, earthy, full-bodied wine. It has attractive red berry fruits, light tannins, a juicy wine that has open fruit flavors. Drink now. Screwcap.
Fruity and aromatic, inviting and fresh—there is real zip and a spring in the step of this citrus-focused, slender Riesling. Zesty lemon and grapefruit peel take center stage on the streamlined palate and make for a super-refreshing finish.
Barrel spice, violet, tobacco and earth aromas are followed by blue- and purple-fruit flavors, with the tannins showing a surprising amount of softness and suppleness for the variety. It's a mixture of intrigue and delivery, with a finish that glides.
This 100% varietal wine seems to still be in its shell, with light notes of coffee, plum and licorice along with other barrel spices. The fruit flavors are supple with some heft to the tannins and a tart lick of acidity that spruces things up. A lot of good things are going on here but they don't quite all come together.
This easy Brut Prosecco opens with a light, luminous appearance and tonic bubbling. Aromas of dried flower and crushed white pepper give the wine a tight, linear finish.
90–92. Barrel sample. With some sumptuous texture and fruits, this is a full and ripe wine. It has a ripe, rich character, and is quite forward and fruity.
Soft, ripe and tasty, this fruit-forward Cabernet offers plenty of palate-pleasing currant, cassis, cherry and mocha flavors, along with sweet smoky oak. It's a dry wine, but long on the finish in ripe fruit, and the tannins are harmoniously integrated. Drink now.
This is as good as Prosecco gets. Bisol blends 85 percent Prosecco with Verdiso and Pinot Bianco to produce a luminous and delicately sublime sparkler with distinct lemon-lime and mineral notes weaved within fruity, fresh whole. The wine's overall presentation is clean, genuine and delicious: Persistent perlage makes it creamy and frothy in the mouth with lively accents of acidity at the close. A perfect pair to cocktail and finger foods.
This wine has some off aromas, seeming to show some oxygen exposure, which distracts from its notes of orange peel and spice. The palate is considerably better but struggles to make up the difference.
Jaxon Keys is a new Mendocino County producer operating out of the former Jepson Winery, which has been completely redone. One of its first wines, this nonvintage Rhône-inspired blend of 60% Grenache, 20% Syrah and 20% Petite Sirah, has a pleasing nose full of red and blackberry fruit with a dollop of earthiness and good acid. Stainless-steel fermented.
This feels light and rather dilute. It has varietal pepper and some spice, but the main effect is one of acidity, crispness and freshness. The lychee tropical fruit element is underplayed in favor of crispness. It should certainly work with food.
Opulent touches of campfire smoke and exotic spice are followed by black fruit, plum and cassis. This Brunello Riserva delivers a rich, smooth texture on the finish.
You can almost smell the minerals and acids in this Chardonnay. The flavors verify the aroma, adding fruitier notes of limes, sweet apples and white peaches, complexed with the creamy, smoky nuances of new oak and sur lies aging.
Solid berry and oak spice aromas turn darker and more rubbery as this airs out. A strong-boned, grabby palate holds medicinal berry and mild hickory flavors. On the finish, this is big but also tannic and bumpy.
Opaque in color, with heady aromas of berry fruits, copious oak and minerality, this is a generous and fiery red blend. In the mouth, the feel is hot and edgy; flavors of molasses, roasted berry fruits and smoked meat finish hollow.
Hints of sage and thyme lend a distinctly herbal, savory tone to fresh apple notes on this lemony-tart, but refreshingly easy-drinking Riesling. It's off dry in style with a delicate honey flavor that lingers on the finish.
This Catalonian Cabernet is roasted and woody on the nose despite being more than seven years old. In the mouth, it has thinned out, leaving more acidity than weight and body. Flavors of oaky red plum and cherry finish lean, long and with noticeable flavors of vanilla and butter. Drink now.
Dried cherry, dark berry, tobacco and grilled herb sensations all come together in this fresh, straightforward red. Smooth but rather fleeting tannins support the bright, juicy flavors. Drink through 2016.
Lots of lush, ripe richness in this smooth drinking Petite Sirah. The blackberry, black currant, chocolate and sandalwood flavors are delicious. Pretty good price for the quality.
This wine is distinct and interesting. It's dry and intense in citrusy acids, with a softening touch of fig and peach. A well-made, good wine. Try with Waldorf salad.
This falls sbetween a rosé and an orange wine in its appearance, a pale salmon/copper shade that results from 36 hours of skin contact before pressing. Scents of hibiscus tea and rosewater put a delicate top note ahead of rich, ripe, round and spicy citrus fruit. A strong impression of cinnamon marks the finish.
Made with a 70-30 blend of Montepulciano and Nero di Troia grapes (the first adds softness and the latter gives structure), Rupicolo is a bargain buy and a great pairing partner to oven-roasted pasta or meatloaf. It's an easygoing wine but its natural density and sunny insides help give it a modern, New World feel.
Red Willow is Columbia's showplace, and the relationship between winemaker David Lake and winegrower Mike Sauer is symbiosis at its best. The Cab Franc is a tight, tannic, earthy wine, with layers of mineral digging deep into the wine. The fruit is hard and the acids firm; it seems to want more time to display its depth and elegance.
Pleasant whiffs of mint mix with blueberry and eraser, leading to a palate full of holiday spice, dark berries, cedar and mint. Medium-bodied with moderate tannins and a dash of acidity, this wine is light enough to be drunk in warm weather but sturdy enough to pair with roast fowl. Imported by 57 Main Street Wine Co.
A firm, dry lean wine, with some tough tannins, but also with great red fruits and good freshness. This young Dão, with its blend of Tinta Roriz, Jaen and Touriga Nacional, is likely to develop, with its tannins and acidity softening. At the moment, freshness is the key.
Mint and herb aromas are followed by a structured and tannic palate. It has balancing acidity, with a juicy black-currant flavor and a dark, dry edge. Like nearly all of the 2010s, it needs to age.
Shows the dried hay and light tobacco herbalness that sometimes accompany Carneros Chards, with riper notes of pineapples. When the oak kicks it, it brings smoke, buttered toast, toasted coconut and vanilla. This is a very dry wine to have with a wide range of foods.
Ripe yellow-peach and apricot notes shine on the nose and palate of this elegantly structured Pinot Gris. Zesty acidity offers a pleasant counterpoint to a softly clingy texture that lingers luxuriously on the palate. It's dry in style, with a deeply mineral, smoky finish.
Sharp in acids, dry and rustic, this country wine offers earthy straw flavors, with a medicinal cherry finish. It's also very tannic.
There's a black, inky quality to this wine thanks to its immediate mineral notes of black stone and slate. It's unlike most wine from Puglia that you will taste and offers a clean, direct but powerful approach.
Cab Franc icewines have some reddish color, this one looking a brownish-red. Cran-apple on the nose, the flavors are not traditional for an icewine, with cranberry and apple hinting at bubblegum sweetness. But the structure is, with acidity wrapping the medium-full body.
Starts with spicy oak and smoky vanilla flavors, and offers modest peach and tropical fruit flavors suggesting pineapple grilled on a skewer. Clean and tasty.
Impresses for its ripely sweet flavors that mass in the mouth and wash across the palate in waves. Currants, cassis, cherries, coffee, vanilla, smoky oak, you name it. The texture is luxurious and smooth as velvet. As big as it is, this wine never loses its harmony and balance.
Pretty mineral tones of delicate talc power and dried flowers frame a powerful wine that reveals a dense core of dried fruit and raisins at its heart. This Amarone is dense and sweet in the mouth with chewy tannins and good length.

Easy and informal, this is exactly the style of wine you'll want to pour with family and friends at, say, an outdoor picnic or barbecue. Packaged in a screwcap bottle, the wine offers aromas of melon, citrus and pear.
This is the palest and lightest of Calera's ‘02 Pinots, but paradoxically it's enormously concentrated in flavor and possible the most ageworthy. It explodes with cherry cola, cherry pie filling, raspberry, blueberry, cocoa-dusted latte and cinnamon-nutmeg spice. But it has the depth and balance for the long haul. Best now through 2012.
Foot trodden in traditional open granite lagars, this is an elegant wine. Ripe black plum jelly flavors are balanced by firm tannins and a fresher edge. It's a wine that will develop over a long time, although with its fruit it's almost ready to drink now. Ideally, though, keep it until 2025.
Seems a bit on the simple side, but still manages to pack in bright lime flavors and a steely, minerally intensity that lingers on the finish. Crisp and clean on the finish, ending with lemon-lime notes.

There's a sweet center to the bouquet, but surrounding it are more complex notes of mushroom, rubber and roast meat. The palate features ripe, clean blackberry and cassis flavors, while the finish shows piercing tannins. Shows some weight and tannic build-up at this point; drink now and into '09.
A faintly metallic flavor spoils this red fruited wine. It brings out tight acidity and red currant fruits while the structure is lost.
Roman Pfaffl is the leader in the new Weinviertel DAC appellation, based around Grüner Veltliner. This wine is medium-bodied, but has typical spice, pepper, apple and pear flavors. Demands instant pleasurable drinking.
With deep, meaty red fruit, leather and a natural, unadulterated sweetness to it, this is one likable Nero d'Avola. The palate is ripe and modern, but the flavors are traditional: spicy plum fruit, nutmeg, earth and oak. Long and dessert-like on the finish, with vanilla and licorice notes. A prototype for the new Sicily.
This wine is just under half Petite Sirah (48%), with the balance Syrah (24%), Counoise (21%) and Mourvèdre. It opens with brooding aromas of red and purple fruit, cigar box and barrel spice. The purple-fruit flavors are rich and palate coating, showing a lovely sense of balance.
Peachy and solid on the nose, with a pinch of oak and white pepper. The palate is generally smooth, with sweet spiced apple and pithy flavors. Banana, pith, vanilla and melon flavors work the finish, which starts out strong then breaks up on the fade.
An off-dry Riesling, that preserves the evocative white perfumed fruits and rounds them out with some sweetness. It has an unmistakable almond and green plum flavor that goes with pear juice and a soft, mouthfilling close. Glass stopper.
This basic Cab shows blackberry, currant and oak flavors wrapped into firm tannins. It's a sound, good wine, with a briary, rustic edge. Drink now.
Based in the Aube in southern Champagne, Fluteau's vineyards are in the Seine valley. This crisp, tight and dry wine is balanced although still young. Textured crisp apple and lemon flavors have a taut, nervy character. It needs to age for a few more months, so drink from 2016.
Not quite ripe, with a stemmy, minty quality dragging down the bright raspberry and cherry fruit flavors. Although the tannins are wonderfully smooth and the wine is fully dry, it doesn't seem like it's going anywhere.
Savory, citrusy and pear-scented, this is fresh, crisp and light, making it ideal for a party.

85-87 Barrel sample. Over-jammy wine, the fruit super-ripe. It seems highly extracted, with a southern spice to it. Out of character.
A soft, creamy rosé sparkler, made by the traditional method, giving a light mousse, with suggestions of strawberries and a gentle, lightly acid aftertaste.
. Big, lively and very intense, this powerful Amarone opens with a blast of blackberry, spice, vanilla, chocolate, leather and tobacco aromas. It shows sticky, extracted concentration in the mouth and ripe, succulent flavors of jammy fruit and cherry liqueur. It's a huge wine from all points of view.
Reduced, green aromas are wiry and suggest blueberry and black currant. A creamy, thick mouthfeel winds up soft, while flavors of oaky, green berry fruits are sweet and lack cohesiveness. Mint, alfalfa and soupy berry flavors control the finish. The blend includes Cabernet Sauvignon, Cab Franc, Petit Verdot and Syrah.
Made white Bordeaux-style, with barrel fermentation in partially new French oak and aged sur lies, this vineyard bottling is always interesting, but the '04 is one of the best. It's rich and creamy, with complex flavors of Meyer lemon, ripe fig, honeydew, crushed pineapple and peppery spice. Yet for all that, it's quite dry. Don't overchill, or you'll miss the nuances.
In a vintage that produced the finest overall lineup of Cayuse wines to date, it may seem a little nit-picky to score some higher and some lower. But the En Chamberlin deserves first place again. Brilliant aromatics of smoked meat, bacon fat and otherworldly roasted accents seduce instantly. Once on the palate, the silky, balanced, near-perfect mix of umami and fruit, plus licorice, cassis, coffee liqueur and black tea notes suggest it's as decadent as it is delicious.
What an aroma. So Côte-Rôtie, so powerful and rich, yet so refined. Masses of white pepper, cassis, freshly ground French roast, cocoa, gingersnap cookie, char, vanilla, cinnamon—and that's just the smell! In the mouth, there's all that and more. Dry, massive, deep and long. A triumph. 2008–2020.
There's 10% Zinfandel blended into this wine, but looking at my notes, I never would've thought so. The pale color is all Pinot Noir, as are the aromas of earth and tomato (the vanilla comes from the French oak barrels). It's light and crisp, with a tart finish.
Soft and rich, with vanilla and quince flavors. A very round, open wine, with only a hint of structure.
This lively, crisp wine comes from a less than an acre of organically grown vines. It has big lemon and green-apple flavors as well as intense acidity that gives a juicy character. With its youthful freshness, it could do with a few more months to soften. Drink from 2017.
Powdery pear and rounded, ripe red apples play on a textured palate, where they are joined by pithy grapefruit peel. A streamlined but full-bodied white, it offers deep, intriguing notions of earth and stone and a long finish.
Kunde has nailed this price point for Syrah. It's rich and complex enough to put on the table beside a fine meal, and while it's not quite in the league of a cult Syrah, on the other hand it won't demand all the attention. Dry and finely tannic, it features flavors of blackberries, cherries, leather, mocha, tobacco, pepper and sage, and finishes long and spicy.
Loosen excelled in 2005, and this beerenauslese is no exception. Brilliantly pure scents of pineapple and honey zoom from the glass, then turn lush and voluptuous on the palate, adding alluring hints of peaches and baked apple. Rich and viscous, it lingers on the finish like wildflower honey.
Dark, dry and tannic in its youth, this Cab is nowhere near ready to drink. It's just too hard and the fruit is buried under all that astringency. But it's really good fruit, packing a whallop of blackberries and black currants. Seems to have the inherent integrity for the long haul. Try 2013–2018.
Ballentine continues to struggle with this bottling. It's more balanced than the '02, but still has a harsh, baked quality to the cherry-berry fruit. That accentuates the tannins, which feel hard and astringent.
Peach and nectarine aromas come with a dusty covering. This Godello feels both round and pulpy but also balanced and well cut by acidity. Dry almost briny white-fruit flavors are stony and suggest nectarine on the finish. Drink now.

Blackberry, cassis, chocolate and lemon flavors finish firm and bold. Drink through 2020.
Marked by flamboyant oak, this wine is dominated by buttered toast and sweet butterscotch flavors. Down under all that is pineapple and mango fruit. Will appeal to fans of this oaky style.

This wine is 38% Cabernet Franc, 26% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Merlot and 14% Petit Verdot. Aromas are locked-up at present, with notes of flowers, high-toned herbs, earth, licorice and dark fruit. The palate is reserved in style, with a smooth feel and a firm squeeze of lightly dry tannins on the finish.

Nice Greek Sauvignon showing melon, apple and peach aromas more than piquant citrus. Offers fine balance, with the acidity propping up apple, honeydew and peach flavors. Fairly chewy and round, with a finish that's slightly warm but satisfying. Could be nice with a salad of tomatoes and feta followed by grilled whole fish. Imported by Fantis Imports, Inc.

This is an old-style, rustic Zin. It's tannic and high in alcohol, with wild berry jam, currant, spice and heady liqueur flavors. A little pricy, but a sound, robust wine with plenty of forthright character.
A little creamy, waxy and scattershot, but also far more exotic and different than most $8 wines. This is barrel-fermented Viura, but the oak level is light and manageable. Flavors of papaya, melon and citrus are almost tropical in scope, and the finish is pretty fresh. Drink right away for maximum freshness.
Made in the popular style, this features ripe orange, lemon, lime and guava flavors, highlighted by brisk acidity and made rich with a buttered toast note and creamy lees. It's an elegant, appealing Chardonnay for drinking now.
Perfumed with mint and eucalyptus aromas, this is a magnificent dry wine. While concentrated with juicy black plums and berries, it still needs time, so don't drink before 2015.

A big, ripe, fruity Pinot Noir, this is basically an orchard in a glass, with flavors of raspberries, cherries, persimmons and more. Beyond that, it's dry and soft. Drink now.
The rich blackberry, vanilla and toast nose sets you up for a lush, supple wine and this one does not disappoint. Full and dense, it offers rich black-cherry and cassis flavors on the palate, and a huge finish with fine-grained tannins. Very well poised for its size, it's approachable now. Nevertheless, it will be much more nuanced and show more finesse in 5–8 years. Keep for a decade or two, maybe more. To be released 5/01.
Aromas of spiced tomato, clove and rubber gloves don't click or suggest much quality. A cloying, sugary palate with mucky berry flavors is less than stellar, as is a sticky finish that tastes like strawberry jam.

This is an inaugural release, made by Napa veteran Cary Gott, grown on the western hillsides above Highway 29. It is 100% Cabernet, classic in its acid and tannin structure, with very ripe cherry compote and cassis flavors. However, it's too sweet for complete balance and enjoyment.

Soft and fragrant, this has flavors of green plum and peach that complement the acidity and the soft and creamy finish.
Nothing is hidden in this bruising, forward Cab. The nose is oaky as can be, but also endowed with intense black fruit.

Give it until 2009, and it should continue for another 3 or 4 years.

Flavors of rich, ripe blackberry jam, mocha and toast are wrapped into firm but refined tannins in this Cabernet. The most basic of the winery's Cabs, and the first of the vintage to be released, it's drinking well now and bodes well for the coming 2011 reserves and blends.
Stewed plum, freshly chopped meat, oregano and fennel serve as attention-grabbing aromas on this inky wine from Paso Robles' Westside. On the palate, the tannins are nicely even and smooth, and the herbal notes tend to overpower the tart cranberry fruit. It's very pleasant, if not quite completely full on the midpalate and finish.
This Sauvignon Blanc is neutral on the nose except for a smack of lime. Mild on the palate, this tastes of briny, salty citrus fruits and peels. A fresh finish confirms that this is straightforward but enjoyable.
Opens with heavy aromas of raisin, prune, leather and chocolate. The palate is just racy enough, with depth, big tannins and structure. Tastes grapy and big, with blackberry fruit and a chocolaty aftertaste. Toasty and a little gritty and tannic on the finish, and ultimately it's a little sweet but still impressive for Chilean Syrah.
An easy, fruity wine, its attractive red cherry flavors bubbling away in soft tannins and light acidity. Very drinkable, and not for aging.
Tomato, red fruit and resiny oak aromas don't exactly scream “fresh.” Feels rustic and scratchy, with herbal, sawdust and vanilla flavors clouding out any quality fruit that might exist. Not much here, really.
A blend of 85% Sangiovese, 10% Canaiolo and 5% Colorino, this offers delicate ripe black-skinned fruit and cooking spice aromas. On the palate, ripe black cherry, espresso and clove flavors are framed by firm tannins. Drink through 2019.
Occasio continues to plumb the depths of the Del Arroyo Vineyard and its abilities with each of the red Bordeaux grapes, this time deftly showing what it can do with the enfant terrible that is Cab Franc. Give it some time to open and then enjoy its densely layered richness of cherry and coffee and plum.
Delicate scents of red berry, blue flower, forest floor and menthol lead the nose. The no-frills palate offers juicy wild cherry, star anise and cured meat framed in firm acidity and close-grained tannins.
Extracted and jammy in black cherries and black raspberries, with hints of cocoa, this wine is fully dry and balanced. It tasty through the smooth finish.
Aromas of ripe black-skinned berry and a whiff of cooking spice lift out of the glass. The solid straightforward palate offers black currant, dried cherry and clove framed in seasoned tannins.
There is fine red berry acidity here, with a caramel note, the wine feeling rich, hinting at pepper and bitter almonds.
Soft and creamy, structured with some green apple skin flavors, and easy, fresh acidity. It has good weight alongside tannins and ripe fruit.
Generous strawberry and cherry flavors make this medium-bodied wine taste fruity and fresh, and a gentle texture buoyed by light acidity seems to match their modulated intensity. It finishes dry and with a good touch of tannin.
This Grenache/Syrah/Tempranillo blend is already showing hints of oxidation. The toasty nose brings scents of sweet baking spices and orange liqueur as well, but the fruit is dried out and the finish astringent and attenuated.
This Riesling is an odd one. Aromas of yeast and peach blossom come with a note of cured ham, while the palate is sticky and low in acidity. Creamy, honeyed flavors alongside green melon, vanilla and yeast finish waxy and creamy.
This is loaded with mixed fruit flavors, in fact it's a bit of a fruit salad of a wine. But it lacks definition or specificity, tasting more like a good mutt wine than a superpremium Cabernet. It's pleasant and ready to drink now.
High alcohol is giving this 100% Cabernet some inherent instability that warrants against extended aging. However, if you drink it soon, you'll find a vastly rich, opulent wine, with blackberry jam, mocha and toasty oak flavors whose tannins reflect Napa's best. A fabulous steak, perfectly charred and prepared, will make you drain the bottle.
There's a light whiff of the chicken coop here, adding an unexpected note of earthiness to the fresh raspberry fruit. The flavors spread out horizontally across the palate, coating it completely and lingering with a finishing touch of mint chocolate cookie.
Black pepper, black plum and blueberry show on the nose of this bottling from the nearly 900-acre vineyard atop Cuesta Grade, where it enjoys essentially its own dedicated appellation. A very full mouthfeel delivers blueberry and blackberry-paste flavors along with pencil lead, black coffee and bitter espresso. Still a tad firm in structure, this should age well and open even further in the years to come.
After skipping a vintage, this Rocks District wine is an aromatic tour de force, with notes of grilled asparagus, stems, black and green olives, crushed flowers and mineral, revealing more on each swirl. The palate brings abundant savory flavors that are simultaneously intense and reserved, with a sense of balance that is captivating and a finish that kicks it up a notch.
This big, powerfully fruity Pinot Noir screams coastal California all the way through. The raspberry, cherry and spice flavors, brightened with acidity, taste of long, warm days and cool nights. It's a good wine, but too young, and would have benefited had the winery held it back a year or so before release. Better into 2012.
Raspingly dry, with tough, hard-edged tannins, and disagreeable sweet and sour Chinese sauce flavors that finish astringent.
As with most of Oregon's 2006 Pinots, this shows more grip and fullness than the winery's '07. There's a strong smoky character, presumably from barrel toast, and a thick and chewy midpalate of mixed berries and tart cherry fruit. The acids stick out a bit, but the dominant flavor is cherry, with a spicy herbal edge.
Wet stone and a chalky underbelly of crisp, clean and low-oaked fruit entices in this food-friendly wine, elegant in lemon, lime and green apple. Juicy and well-rounded, it's an easily enjoyable wine at a fair price that will please a range of palates.
Sweetly ripe and oaky, with pineapple jam, kiwi, pear and green apple, and notes of vanilla, buttered popcorn and cream. Defines the fruit-forward, buttery style of Chardonnay in a soft, forward way.
A nice, refreshing Riesling, clean and crisp, with rich flavors of citrus fruits, minerals, honeysuckle and jasmine. The residual sugar is .63%, making it just a litt off-dry. No oak on this polished gem.
Soft, perfumed wine that has fresh red berry fruits, ripe tannins and a juicy fragrance. This is fruity and ready for drinking in the next 2–3 years. Screwcap.
Named after the King of France crowned in 1429 by Joan of Arc in Reims cathedral, this is the counterpart of the Blanc de Blancs. It's a rich wine, soft with ripe quince and yellow plum fruits. Acidity balances with the rounded, fruity aftertaste.
A good, solid Pinot Noir, with pleasantly upfront raspberry and cherry flavors. It's silky and dry, with a bite of acidity. Earns extra points for sheer deliciousness. Drink now.
A noticeable step down from the 2005 Volver. This vintage is gangly and quasi out of control. At 14.5% alcohol, it's very big. And the aromas of shoe polish, burnt rubber, cola and vinegar are almost volatile and aggressive. Finishes edgy, sort of tannic and oily. Seems like the producer went straight for power and size while forgetting about balance.
This is a tight, textured and fruity wine. With a great mineral texture and steely structure, it is a wine for some aging. Lemon and pink grapefruit flavors sheer through the texture, still waiting to balance. From 2017 it will be a fine wine.
This is estate-grown, Merlot, estate grown, with a fragrant and spicy nose. The herbaceousness is reminiscent of Carmenère, and it continues into a somewhat green mid-palate. Best paired with a grilled steak or burger, so the tannins and acids have some fat to cut through.
White spring flower, ripe pear and grilled herb aromas take center stage in this medium-bodied white. The bright, linear palate offers green apple and citrus flavors, with a hint of clove.
Good, in a simple way, with Chardonnay personality that will appeal to lots of people. It's dry and creamy in texture, with bright acidity framing citrus and tropical fruit, peach, mineral and vanilla flavors.
This wine from the personal vineyard of the winery's co-founder has assertive woodsmoke, toasted oak and forest aromas, its bright black cherry and pomegranate flavors accented by tamarind and black pepper. While strongly oaky and firmly tannic in texture, it has a sleek and nervy aspect that's very appealing.
Aromas of black-skinned fruit, baking spice and mocha lead the nose while the ripe palate offers black plum, vanilla and tobacco. Assertive tannins and the heat of evident alcohol provide the framework. Drink through 2019.
Rugged and hearty, with some jagged tannins framing blackberry, herb and cedar flavors. There's a sweet streak of licorice throughout.
I've liked Galante's Blackjack Cab for its balanced ageworthiness, one of the few south-of-San Francisco Cabs you can say that about. This vintage, the wine is big in fruit but tight in tannins and acids. Although decanting will soften it and a good steak will improve it, it's best left alone for at least a year, and should hold for the rest of this decade.
A good, lusty Zinfandel, robust and sweet in berry, mocha, tobacco, cola and spice flavors. It's a blend of Ottomino's various vineyards.
Meaty and rubbery, but that's young Bonarda. This is a sound wine with dark berry flavors, raisin and pulsing acidity. Still, there's modest roundness to the palate and length to the finish. Overall, it's tasty, full and borderline raisiny. Drink now.
Friendly aromas of kirsch and black cherry form the opening. The palate feels plump and flush, with good density and overall balance. In the mouth, nothing is complicated; the wine tastes of pure berry and plum fruits with some chocolaty oak on the finish.
Blueberry pie, black plum, licorice and a touch of tobacco show on the inviting nose of this solid bottling from the Morgan Hill producer. The palate is very well integrated and delicious, with blackberry jam, vanilla cookies and strong espresso flavors, framed by sticky, prominent tannins.
Lots of toasted, smoky, coffee-like aromas and flavors coat the raspberry and tart blackberry core of this medium-bodied wine. It's a bit much in terms of oak, but makes a fun exercise, especially when paired with its sister wine made in American oak.
Muffled, shy aromas are redolent of cherries, dried flowers and pear drops. Soft and rounded, the palate has a sweet quality about its core, with mild acids and a dusting of tannins.
Light and delicate, thist shows distant tones of fragrant fruit and tangy citrus. Its natural sweetness helps make the finish feel rich and generous.
Lots of zesty acidity in this fruity Sauvignon Blanc. It's ripe and forward in lemon, lime, green apple, vanilla and spice flavors. Easy to drink with Asian fare.
This big-shouldered blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Petit Verdot, 10% Cabernet Franc and 5% Merlot offers soft waves of black fruit and smoky oak. It's accented with meatier elements of brick and tobacco.
Enhanced with tiny percentages of Merlot and Canaiolo, this Sangiovese-dominant wine shows sweet cherry and blueberry aromas, with pretty accents of exotic spice and toasted almond. Pair this with fried chicken or cotoletta alla Milanese.
A Petite Sirah abundant in black pepper and cinnamon spice, structured, ripe and leathery. The tannins show promise for aging 5–7 years, the wine's black fruit waiting to burst forth.
Tannic and hard around the edges, it has a woody character. The black currant fruit is there but spoiled by the rest of the flavors.
The aromas suggest this wine has too much wood for its own good. The palate is just rich enough to sustain all that toast, while also allowing room for some crisp white and green fruits. Drink this wine from 2016.
They can't call the grapes old vine, because the vineyard is only 15 years old. But it was planted from clones that constituted an old vineyard that contained Petite Sirah, Carignane, Mataro and Alicante Bouschet. The wine is robust and rustic, with bright, briary berry fruit and spice flavors that will stand up well against any roasted meats.
Concentrated black fruit aromas with a cedary spin start this classy, ageable Cab from Marc Kent. On the palate, leather, mocha and big berry flavors have a masculine, serious edge. A bit chewy but very good balance and finish. Pair with grilled meat, game dishes.
This pretty Moscato d'Asti shows a rich, creamy quality, thanks to the sweet tones of honey, peach and exotic fruit that drive the bouquet. The texture is sticky and thick, but a zesty touch of fresh acidity shows up right at the end to keep the palate refreshed.
Shy and clean on the nose, which offers up only mild grapefruit and lime. The feel is tight and stony, with pithy citrus and green apple flavors. Leans towards green and herbaceous on the finish, but never fully goes green while maintaining clarity and crispness.
This wine pretty much typifies what people mean when they talk about “New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc.” There's a grassy, herbaceous and green-pea edge to the lime and tropical- fruit flavors.
Flinty overtones of yeast reveal how very young this wine is. The verve that springs from the glass is undeniable. While the focus is on grapefruit and lemon zest in a tightly pulled focus, there are glimpses of honeycomb, popcorn, treacle, pollen and hints of tropicality, with a touch of pineapple. Hold this wine for a while longer and it will unfold itself graciously. Drink 2016–2020.
Light aromas of red berry, cola, and brown sugar are pleasant on the nose, but the fruit gets lost in the mouth. Light and dry, with high acidity, the mineralty of this wine has very little red fruit to balance it.
92-94 Barrel sample. A hugely perfumed wine with smooth tannins. It's impressively ripe, with vibrant black fruits.
A typical blend from Gascogne, the wine has both acidity and fresh, young fruitiness. Herbaceous and citrus-laced with gooseberries, the wine is bright and light without losing any of its intensity. Drink now and over the next year. Screwcap.
This is so delicious and classic, it's totally enjoyable now, but it has the structural balance to age for quite a while. It impresses for the complex blackberry, currant and cedar flavors and for the quality of the tannins, which are dramatically rich and ripe. Best now and for at least 10 years.
Toasted oak at the front with thick berry ripeness and unique layers of aromas that include plum, vanilla, resin and even asphalt. A New World-style wine that should integrate beautifully in a few more years. Imported by Montecastelli Selections.
A bit softer and suppler than the Helmsman, this Merlot-led blend features aromas of brown sugar, cinnamon, dried herbs and cassis. More cedar emerges on the palate, giving it a classic Bordeaux blend profile. Drink now–2020.
Intense and tightly wound, this Riesling gradually unfolds layers of white pepper, green plums and Key lime pie. The lingering quince-flavored finish is mouthwateringly crisp but not quite dry. Try with mushroom pasta. Drink now for the youthful fruit or wait a few years for more complexity.
Thin at first sip, this opens up in the glass with an interesting mix of scents—body powder, tart cherry, dried herbs. It's a southern Rhône style blend, more than two thirds Mourvèdre. It carries some of that green character on through the finish.
This Brunello opens with an intense, dark garnet color and shows lush softness and ripe blackberry fruit with perfumed notes of blue flower, plum cake and sweet spice. The mouthfeel is characterized by firm structure and yielding tannins.
Functional and fruity, with big aromas of plum and berry on the slightly foxy nose. Fully tannic across the palate, so it feels kind of hard. The big berry flavors are loud and basic.
A black berry note and soft tannins, plus its just-off-dry character give this wine a juicy, jammy quality. It has a hint of spice while retaining its light, fruity touch.
A soft wine, now ready to drink with any herbaceous element toned down. It has freshness still, flavors of tangy orange and a considerable final acidity.
Black raspberry, blueberry and black cherry fruit is at the heart of this tart, racy wine. These primary fruit flavors are presented in a clean, immaculate frame of mostly neutral oak. Good length, with just a hint of finishing heat.
This Costco brand has become a reliable source for bargain Châteauneuf-du-Pape. This vintage is a bit firmer and more tannic than others, but it still weaves together cherry and leather notes into a pleasing whole. It might need a year or two to soften, but it should provide good drinking through 2025.
Dry, but rustic and minty. Shows its Pinot Noir personality in the silky texture and suggestions of cherries and oak. Drink now.
This fresh, spicy Merlot is easy to drink, and it deals jammy berry, cola and fruit punch flavors. It's a great wine to serve at parties.
The delicate smoke and hazelnut scent of oak shines through and makes a frame for ripe apricot and Mirabelle plums. The palate is soft and rounded, set off by pizzazz from the lively acidity that underlines the juicy core.
Aromas suggesting underbrush, aromatic herb, violet, new leather and earthy game follow through to the chewy, full-bodied palate in this wine, along with ripe black cherry and a hint of baking spice. It's structured and surprisingly accessible, with rounded, velvety tannins. Drink 2018–2028.
Having now tasted this wine on three separate occasions, I'm certain it will continue to improve in the bottle, but how stingy my current rating will ultimately seem is an open question. From tank prior to bottling, it was a rich, custardy, vibrant wine that I would have rated in the low 90s. Tasted blind after bottling, I've not yet found that same level of quality, but my ratings have climbed from low-mid 80s (back in the early part of this year) to high 80s now, as the wine seems to be regaining some of its rich, velvety texture to help balance its formidable acidity. Worth trying again in another year or two. Imported by Wilson Daniels Ltd.
A smooth, velvety textured wine, full of slightly overripe dark cherry, raspberry and plum with accents of cassis, tea and spice that thrill the palate. Closing with a clean and silky finish, this wine is sure to be a crowd pleaser. It's 60% Cab, 30% Merlot and 10% Shiraz.
Aligi Sassu is a lovely sparkler without added sugar or liqueur. It offers a fragrance of white flower, lemon drop and nut. The palate delivers citrus, apple and almond flavors along with refined, persistent bubbles and a bone-dry finish.
This has a curious caramel aroma from the wood aging. It's tough and extracted, a powerhouse of hard tannins without enough fruit.
This wine is a blend of fruit from Bacchus, Phinny Hill and Loess vineyards. Brooding aromas of black cherry, herb and barrel spice are followed by pitch-black blackberry and game flavors, backed by tightly coiled tannins. It comes off as a bit richer than the norm for this winery but still delivers the goods. Best after 2022.
Loads of black fruit intensity is backed by soft notes of chocolate, leather and spice. The wine boasts a very plump and round style that makes it a pleasure to savor.
A direct and appealing wine, with notes of wild strawberry, wet stone, cherry and cranberry. It's fruity and concentrated while still retaining lightness of expression. Drawn out fruit flavors linger on the finish.
A 50-50 blend of Nero d'Avola and Syrah, Scialo shows ripe fruit tones of blackberry and cherry followed by chocolate and dried tobacco. These two varieties—one is a native of Sicily and the other is a classic international grape—make for a beautiful marriage of flavors and aromas.
This wine takes a modern approach to Brunello that is instantly recognized by its penetrating aromas of smoke and toasted oak that will surely relax with a few more years of cellar aging. Chewy tannins, fresh berry flavors and good length characterize the oak-driven mouthfeel.
Wine doesn't get much bigger than this. Bold and opulent, with a whopping 17% alcohol, this over-the-top bottling is aged in oak for two years and delivers masculine, chewy aromas of blackberry jam and Indian spice. Pair it with wedges of aged pecorino cheese.
This is a ripe concentrated wine, full of black-currant fruit and dense tannins. The two balance each other giving a wine that has weight and a medium-term future. Drink from 2018.
There is an austere, serious edge to this wine, with its dark tannins and fine black-currant acidity. It is very structured and likely to age well. Drink from 2017.
Bold hits of spice and toasted cedar envelop ripe black-cherry and plum flavors in this Merlot-based wine (augmented by proportions of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot). The palate is intensely lush and fruity but anchored neatly by a bitter edge of tannins and cranberry acidity. Should drink well through 2023.
Always loaded with character, once again this wine doesn't disappoint. The aromas are racy, stylish and clean, filled with lime and hay, green grass and honey, fig and melon. And what great flavors, big, ripe, and juicy. It seems a little bit sweet, but the acidity is high, creating a crisp, rich wine that's full-bodied and flavorful. Editors' Choice.
A lovely Pinot Noir, dry and silky, giving lots of pleasure in the mouth. Shows polished cherry, raspberry and spice flavors. From Cargasacchi.
This is a lovely, light-hearted yet complex 100% varietal wine that shows the beauty of a lighter touch and cooler climate. Cedar, herb and compost provide a wildness next to aromas of feral mushroom. Intriguing all the way around, this wine finishes in a burst of white pepper.
Softly tannic, fully dry, and with a peppery edge, this is an elegant Cabernet ready to drink now with a good steak. It has a nice core of juicy blackberries, black cherries and cassis.
It's a proper Pinot Noir in the silky texture and cherry and cola flavors, which finish smooth and dry. Other than that, it's rustic and heavy.
This well-priced wine shows Cabernet's lighter side. It offers bright sensations of red currant, hints of cedar wood and baking spices along fresh acidity and supple tannins. It's is made to be drunk young so enjoy soon.
Lots of zesty acidity in this Sauvignon Blanc, with pineapple and lemon jam flavors. It's a dry, tart and mouthwateringly fresh white wine, and a good apéritif sipper.
Ripe, forward blackberry, cherry, currant and licorice flavors mark this Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend. It's dry, and the tannins are ultrarefined. But there's an astringent feeling that shuts down the palate's appreciation of how good it is. This is a wine you want to cellar for 4–6 years.
Clove, black-licorice gumdrops, some mint and a meaty quality mark the nose. It’s weighty, with raspberry fruit touched by the taste of tomato. It doesn’t offer a lot of finesse, and the oak is heavy on the end.
This lovely sparkling wine is made with no dosage or added sugar. It offers scents of warm, just baked bread, citrus and roasted almond. The palate offers peach, apple, citrus and a hint of walnut along with crisp, clean acidity. It's smooth, with fine bubbles and a creamy texture.
The wine is not named after Austria's emperor, but after a Pitnauer family member. The blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Zweigelt works well, giving a powerful, dry, concentrated wine with big tannins. At this stage, the wood is rather too dominant, but that should soften  over the next year.
This wine's fragrant blue flower and red berry aromas lift out of the glass. On the savory palate, ground clove accents raspberry jam and wild cherry notes, all hemmed in with refined tannins.
From a small vineyard near the coast at Hyères, this wine has the freshest red-berry fruits and lively, bright acidity. Its freshness and lightness make it a fine apéritif style, delicious to drink immediately.
Spicy and rugged, with wild blackberry, mulberry, tobacco and bitter chocolate flavors, this everyday Zin is a great buy for a big party. It'll go great with everything from buffalo wings and pizza to burgers and lasagna.
Apple and modest dusty white-fruit aromas are about all you'll get from the neutral bouquet, while the palate is sweet and a little candied, with apple and mango flavors. Fleshy and chunky, but good enough to enjoy in a casual setting. Probably a good base wine for white sangria.
A tad riper, fuller and richer than the 2009 vintage, this wine is deep, subtle and complex, with a myriad of fruit and mineral flavors. Cassis, olive, fresh herb, toast, caramel and coconut are all in play, balanced and layered. The wine is young, tart and full of promise for the long term; hold at least 10–15 years.
Capitalizing on the fashion for Malbec, this wine is closer to Argentina than Cahors. It has soft tannins and a ripe and juicy flavor of red-berry fruits. Acidity and a soft aftertaste reinforce this New World feel.
The grapes for this lovely wine come from the Dry Stack Vineyard and Fallenleaf, some of which is planted to the Sauvignon Musque clone. Zesty acidity takes the first punch, remaining brightly balanced and explosive on the palate, with additional hits of white peach, apricot and honey.
A mostly neutral nose is devoid of fruit aromas and instead offers dusty notes of crushed rocks. This is a heavy rosé made from Garnacha, Syrah and Carignan. It's rather bitter and miserly in terms of fruit flavor, with a peppercorn finish.
Fresh minerality and dancing floral notes make the nose on this reserve Riesling enticing. On the palate, typical Riesling flavors of spice and flowers are slightly slowed by a viscous, heavier mouthfeel, but overall, the wine is harmonious. Great with a spicy Indian dish like Vindaloo—it could hold its own.
Estate grown and bottled, this Pinot comes from a cool, organic vineyard planted to several different clones. Sultry and spicy in dark cherry and berry fruit, the spice is all clove with a touch of orange zest, completely pleasurable and smooth drinking.
Sweet, ripe and healthy, with a slight touch of fresh herbs accenting the nose. The palate shows a roundness and good balance, and the flavors of cola and blackberry are simple to understand and enjoy. Smooth, easy stuff, with a kiss of oak and light but present tannins.
Here's a heavily oak-influenced Barbera with distinctive tones of spice, tobacco, wood, bramble and forest floor. There are red fruit notes in there, mostly masked by the wood. Give this wine two or three more years of bottle aging to find harmony.
Italy's first cru Verdicchio, Le Moie offers loads of citrus-and lime-like nuances on the heels of stone fruit, field flowers and fruit candy. Sweet fruit notes create a lively, tangy impression. A tiny percentage is aged in wood.
This blend offers notes of herbs, woodspice, black licorice and cherry. It's full of sweet black fruit flavors, with the alcohol riding high and providing some distraction.
Lightly spicy, this soft wine has a zesty tang of orange and bright strawberries that are ripe and gently fruity. The wine is open, ready to drink.
A firm wine that is mainly tannin without a great fruit element. It is dry, tight and hard-edged.
So rich and complex, so decadently delicious, you want to drink the whole bottle. Takes the blackberries and black currants of Cabernet Sauvignon, merges them with Syrah's bacon and pepper, flirts with Grenache's cherries, and then uplifts it all with Viognier's citrusy brightness and acidity. A compelling wine that will hold through 2013.
More powerfully built than most Saar wines, with a weighty 10% alcohol providing a solid core. Its dense, slate-driven aromas glide into a richly textured, creamy mouthfeel filled with smoke, petrol and peach-pear flavors that turn slightly oily on the finish. A bit different, but worth trying.
With its firm tannins and powerful fruit, the style of Clos de Vougeot is well expressed. It has weight, and it is loaded with juicy black fruits and acidity. With its dense texture, it's a wine for the long haul.
This is an easy, fragrant blend that offers simple aromas of cherry, wild berry and white almond. The wine is thin, but crisp with a bright berry finish.
Smells sweet and gummy, like a plum-flavored sucking candy or a piece of grape bubblegum. The palate is a bit punishing and hard, while wild blackberry, acidity and finishing oak make up the flavors. Lively but untamed.
Beautifully rounded wine, with just a hint of vanilla to go with the peach and watermelon flavors, ripe plums and delicate acidity. Worth aging although ready to drink now.
Seppeltsfield's 1987 Para Tawny features ample rancio complexity coupled with candied citrus notes. It's amazingly viscous, rich and mouthcoating, and seems to linger forever on the palate. Only 25 cases imported.
This is 100% new oak (primarily Taransaud, 32 months), and it's a marvelous example of the grape, the vineyard and the strengths of Washington fruit. The Shafer Hillside Select is the inspiration for the extended barrel aging and the focus on round, sweet tannins. This is a tight wine, with a lovely purity of fruit that captures the cassis, the black cherry, the subtle herbal character of the Cabernet grape. This is from the oldest block in the vineyard—now eight -year-old vines.
A bit sharp now, which is the most glaring feature of this otherwise rich Pinot Noir. It's very dry, with a firmly tannic structure, while the cherry, cola, licorice and sandalwood flavors are delicious. Brief cellaring is warranted, but that sharpness is a warning that the long term may be a gamble.
Subtle aromas suggesting moist soil, violet, red berry and a whiff of leather come together on this light-bodied red. On the straightforward palate, lithe tannins and bright acidity provide easygoing support for juicy Morello cherry, clove and a touch of anise. Enjoy soon.
Caramel and vanilla provide a richness and influence of barrel from the nose, before crisp apple delivers itself on the palate. Stony minerality keeps the wine fresh and vibrant, finishing with a touch of ginger.
Taylors (exported under the Wakefield Estate label) is a top-notch source for Cabernet Sauvignon. The 2004 boasts a big nose of cassis, mint or eucalyptus and a touch of roasted peppers. It's mouthfilling, with plenty of soft tannins, then finishes with more cassis and a hint of coffee.
Sourced from Kiona's End of the Road vineyard, this pure Carmenère is packed with plenty of that grape's pyrazine and stem scents and flavors. A splash of Cabernet Franc was added to the final blend. Somehow flavors of mint and chocolate have been introduced, along with the quite tart, pale red fruits.
Just what Merlot should be, a soft, gently appealing wine whose easy tannins make it drinkable now. It's rich and spicy in raspberry and cherry fruit and cedar flavors.
Fairly neutral on the nose for Carmenère, with mild floral berry notes. The palate is composed but reserved as it deals plum, vanilla and herbal undertones. Like many of its neighbors, this wine is creamy and lactic, with mild green/herbal notes interacting with richer plum and berry flavors. Good for a brand we haven't tried before.
Bright and sweetly fruity, with blackberry and black cherry fruit matched to vanilla-flavored oak. A bit high-toned, soft and fresh, with lots of immediate drinking appeal.
A bit burnt in grilled cherry fruit and tart in acidity, but otherwise it's a nice, silky Pinot Noir, with pleasant spice and sandalwood flavors. Drink now.
Produced at Château Ravatys for négociant Florent Descombe, this wine is rich and creamy. Wood aging has given it light toastiness and fine, ripe white fruit flavor. Already sophisticated wine, it will age further and be better from 2018.
This is an impressive, very rich, just off-dry wine, floral and flinty, with spice and green plum flavors. It needs at least 3 years to develop its full potential. Glass stopper.
Kilikanoon's blended Cabernet is a solid effort, it just falls short of the consistent excellence of the winery's Rhône varieties. Dried herbs on the nose give way to dark, cola-inflected flavors mixed with brighter berry notes, while slightly astringent tannins impart a drying sensation to the finish. Drink over the next 2–3 years.
A Grenache-Mourvèdre-Syrah blend that's a bit sharp and raisiny. Seems old.
An absolutely delicious Pinot Noir. Hard to exaggerate the drinkability factor. Supremely ripe cherry and raspberry fruit is highlighted by brilliantly crisp acidity to make it all bright and lively. Oak plays second fiddle, contributing rich, tasteful notes of smoke, vanilla and buttered cinnamon toast. Just gorgeous for drinking now and for the next 5–6 years with your best fare.
Shades of golden toast and crushed granite lend depth and complexity to crisp red cherry flavors in this unusually brisk, sprightly Merlot. Refreshingly quaffable, a fringe of soft tannins linger on the short finish.
This is a rich Chardonnay and Arinto blend with a ripe texture and fruit. Aging on the lees has given the wine that extra concentration and depth of flavor. That goes with the apricot and peach fruits and the tight acidity at the end. Drink from 2017.
This multivintage blend nails the essence of Krug, intense richness of fruit and flavor without weight. Meaty mushroom and soy aromas are balanced by rich red fruits, citrus, toast and mineral notes. Long finish. Imported by Clicquot Inc.
Green pear and golden apple aromas lead onto the palate, which is edged by peppy acids.
This 100% Sauvignon Blanc isn't fully ripe yet it's dry and crisp, with a mouthwatering cleanness. There's an edge to the Meyer lemon, lime, green melon and vanilla flavors.
A bit stalky and corny smelling, this lacks the overall purity that can make Albariño great. It's fresh enough, but standard in feel, with simple melon and peach flavors. The finish lacks oomph, and combined with the nose, there are indicators that it's beginning to slip.
This wine demands attention for its deep, dark color, distinct smoke, bacon and maple syrup aromas, rich fruit flavors and a texture saturated with fine tannins. It will appeal to those who love boldness, lots of oak flavor and full body.
In an oxidative style, this is a wine that is smooth and full of ripe fruit tones. With black plum and berry flavors it has just enough of a tannic edge, with a soft aftertaste.
Offering aromas of blackberry, strawberry and green bell pepper, this wine has flavors of raspberry, strawberry, black cherry and leather. The fruit flavors are jammy on the palate and strong tannins and equally strong acidity make for a pleasing wine.
Spice and dark fruit aromas settle fairly well. It's light to medium across the palate, with zesty acidity and standard flavors of black cherry, plum and pepper. Crisp and clean on the finish, confirming its basic but juicy disposition.
Fresh and fruity, Jacques Chardat's wine is packed with red-berry fruit along with a dry core. The tannins and acidity will develop well as the wine ages to produce a ripe, fruity wine. Drink from 2018.
Dark golden in color, this wine offers nectarine and just-ripe apple. High in acidity, medium in body, it has a trace of sourness on the finish.
This is a cool, light wine. It has stalky black fruits and tannins that come from the fruit skins. It is a wine to drink almost as an apéritif: light and fruity at the end.
This features an appealingly toasty aroma, substantial cherry and cassis fruit and a concentrated core. Elements of stem wood, black olive and clean earth filter through the finish, along with perfectly ripe tannins.
A light, crisp style that hints at spice but shows delicious fresh fruit. The acidity shows through, giving a vibrant character to the fruit.
Rich and densely extracted, this modern expression of Barbera d'Asti Superiore from the Nizza subzone offers enormous richness, power and intensity. The wine is smooth and velvety in the mouth with bright cherry and cassis flavors on the close.
Good price for a Cab of this elegance and complexity. It's a dry, full-bodied wine, with proper varietal flavors of black currants and cedar. A great substitute for a more expensive Cab in this economy.
Starts off with beautiful scents of minerals, dried spices and a hint of peach, but not quite as attractive on the palate, where it seems heavy at times despite some unreleased CO2. Then it turns tangy-tart on the finish. This youthful wine comes across as a bit disjointed; hopefully, that will improve over the next few months in bottle and this rating will look conservative.
The Donum Estate continues to show its prowess with this variety in addition to its speciality, Pinot Noir, and this bottling is no exception. High-toned lemon flavors meet supportive oak and a light-bodied layering of fresh pear and honeycomb, buoyed by bright acidity from start to finish.
This blend of Syrah and Grenache comes from vineyards owned by the Jeanjean family. It is soft and gentle, although there are some tannins hiding in the background. The fruits are clean, somewhat jammy, easy to drink.
A big, muscular Petite Sirah, showing the classic profile of the variety. Rich and thick in tannins, it showcases powerful blackberry, plum, currant, bacon and black pepper flavors that finish with fruity sweetness, although the wine is technically dry. A welcome addition to the top tier of Petite Sirah in California.
Aromas of flowers, graphite, licorice and high-toned herbs are followed by red- and black-fruit flavors that coat the palate from end to end. This has an extremely high yum factor that demands another sip.
This has a dark red-black color, with densely packed aromas that seem so tight they are not giving up much. Flavors of concentrated dark plum and white pepper are interlaced with very firm tannins. It's full bodied, young and wound up tight. Drink it now for the wow factor, or be adventurous and save it until 2020 to see how much more flavor complexity develops.
There is some richness here, a wine that has sweet plum and spice flavors followed by a toasty character. The fruit has some stalkiness, while the acidity is very present. Could age well.
Xinomavro, meaning acid-black, is one of Greece's better indigenous reds and the only variety in Naoussa. It can make wines with firm acidity and jackhammer tannins, as in this example, which also shows a spicy nose of black pepper, coffee and red fruit. Flavors are a bit darker and sweeter, to match the heavy tannins, with black spicy fruit, coffee and a touch of chocolate. Will soften a bit with time.
This is a sharp, grassy Pinot Gris, which does more than a gentle bow in the direction of Sauvignon Blanc. Herbaceous, peppery and penetrating, it's green and acidic, yet flavorful and a resonant food wine also.
This is one of the sweetest Reserve Ports on the market. As such, it is an acquired taste for those used to the more classic, drier styles. But it holds together well, with its ripe fruit, tastes of raisins and richness.
A blend specifically targeted at the U.S. market, this 51% Cab-49% Shiraz marries Cabernet's mint and cassis with Shiraz's savory plum and spice. Tannins are soft, but there's still enough structure on the finish that this wine can pair with fattier cuts of beef or lamb.
A fine combination of apples and cream flavors and a powerful mineral texture, showing a generous side of Sauvignon Blanc, with apricots and peaches as well as an intense layer of citrus. The final flavors are of spice, vanilla mixed with crisp acidity.
The bouquet is briary, with aromas of clipped berry and herb. It feels sassy, edgy and tannic, with herbal flavors of raspberry and red currant. The finish is a little choppy and tannic, with a subtle green-flavored accent.
Straightforward, fresh and citrusy, this is a 100% Chardonnay sparkler that proves quality and price are not always perfectly linked, making it a great value. It is a little soft and plush in style, but shows some leesy hints and plenty of tangerine fruit on the moderately long finish.
Aromas of Mediterranean scrub, violet, wild berry and a whiff of menthol lead the nose on this bright, easygoing red. The racy, straightforward palate offers sour cherry, pomegranate and a hint of star anise alongside zesty acidity and smooth tannins. A blast of orange closes the finish.
Mildly raisiny on the bouquet. The palate is round and full-bodied, with blackberry and roasted plum flavors backed by smooth tannins and a chocolaty, savory finish. Heavier and warmer than some red blends, but not clumsy or overdone.
This is a mirror image of the winery's Riesling, which provides 10% of the blend. Fragrant rose petal and toasted nut aromas mingle, creating a sensuous effect. It's quite dry, fresh and youthful, capturing the intensity of Washington fruit and the elegance of an Alsatian Gewürztraminer. This should make an excellent cellar wine, but there's no reason it can't be enjoyed immediately.
A smoky tinge to the garnet color and savory, forest-floor aromas give a slightly earthy character to this deceptively full-bodied, fascinating wine. The flavors kick in vivid rhubarb, raspberry and pomegranate notes, while firm tannins, brisk acidity and a nice, dry mouthfeel add good structure.
This blend of the very local Petit Courbu and Petit Manseng grapes comes from the same region as Madiran. The wine is dry but rich—very rich—with apricot and honey flavors. It has concentration, a great tang of lemon and just enough acidity to keep everything in order. This is ready to drink.
This is a rich and seductive yet well-balanced Chenin, offering ripe notes of stone fruit and melon that are framed by threads of lanolin, beeswax, graphite and fynbos. The medium-weight palate is bright and clean, as fresh citrus and green fruit tones are partnered with lively acidity and a pithy citrus and melon-rind flavor on the ensuring finish. Drink now–2020.
The Feudo Principi di Butera estate releases this Cab five or more years after the harvest, although a good argument could be made that it should be released sooner. Tertiary aromas of mineral and dried spice do appear and there's not much fruit left (especially in the hot 2003 vintage). Nonetheless, the wine is elegantly aged: Drink now.
Nearly equal parts Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon, this blend also features good handfuls of Petit Verdot, Merlot and Cabernet Franc that offer soft, velvety flavors of blackberry and blueberry. Lightly oaked, the tannins are grippy while the wine generates an herbal undertone on the nose.
Berry aromas come with an oaky, lactic whiff of plastic. A scratchy palate is fruity but awkward, with generic plum and dark-berry flavors. Fig cookie and chocolaty flavors control a blocky finish.
Shymer is a hearty Sicilian blend of Syrah and Merlot that offers toasted or smoky notes alongside mature red fruit and forest berry. The wine is elegant and smooth in the mouth with lingering notes of ripe fruit on the close.
This white invites you in with floral, citrus and tame tropical aromas and flavors; otherwise it's soft, mid weight and integrated in oak. Made from Mendocino Wine Company's estate La Ribera vineyard, the grapes show off elevated minerality on the finish.
This is a very big and jammy wine, but it's made with expert structure and elegance as well as affordability. Concentrated blackberry, black-currant, smoked beef and lavender aromas arise from the dark juice in the glass. The crème de cassis richness at the tip of the sip dries up into tight tannins and touches of fennel and thyme.
This is a fascinating effort loaded with unusual grace notes, the sort of hints of herb, grass, leaf and bark that characterize this unique vineyard. Resonant and complex, it does not show its 14.9% alcohol; the fruit and tannins are in good balance, though not quite integrated. Give it another couple of years to knit together and you'll have a sensational bottle of Walla Walla Cabernet.
Rich in flavor and texture, this smells like white peach and buttered popcorn with a hint of chalky earthiness. The taste is creamy and reminiscent of honey and toasted almonds. It is medium bodied, but lush and almost thick in mouthfeel, with flavors that linger on the finish.
Dry, spicy and with good fruit aromas. The palate is tight and scouring, with full acidity. Cherry and cassis flavors are shrill and high-toned, while the finish is solid, tannic and mildly herbal.
While slender in frame, this vibrantly zesty, herbal wine offers loads of intensity and vibe. Tart tangerine and apricot flavors are piercing and fresh, building in concentration and richness through a long, penetrating finish. It seems closed in its youth still, but should gain texture and complexity from 2020–2030.
This wine's nose begins very steely, with fresh cracked chalk aromas, then allows soft caramel candy, pound cake and white flowers to emerge. The very inviting flavors include apple flesh and skins, fresh cut pineapple and slated nuts, all clinging to a very pithy element that cuts the entire palate.
A big, burly, hedonistic wine, this offers layers of pronounced baked apple, pear and caramel. The oak wraps itself around in cinnamon-toast waves, with sizable power on the palate. The joy ride ends with a balanced sense of wet stone, fresh and refined.
Crisp peach and red-fruit flavors combine with vibrant acidity and energizing, fine bubbles to create a balanced and rich sparkling wine. A spicy, crisp fruit character lingers long on the finish.
Filled with aromas and flavors of passion fruit, gooseberries and a touch of grassiness, this is a readily accessible Sauvignon Blanc that might lack a little complexity and richness, but is assertively flavored and goes down easily.
The Jaen grape, local to the Dão, has produced a perfumed juicy wine that is ripe and intensely full of acidity at the same time. It has only light tannins and red berry flavors that are right up front. The wine is ready to drink.
Made from fruit from what many consider to be the finest site for growing Syrah in the state, this wine opens gracefully to reveal scents of plump berry, vanilla and tobacco. Briefly aged in a mix of one- and two-year-old French oak barrels, it offers concentrated berry and black cherry flavors that never turn syrupy. The crisp acidity suggests cellaring for up to a decade.
Well done with the leafy green, lightly peppery character of the grape. Good balance and persistence, with tannins that finish with green tea flavors.
Forward fruit flavors of blackberry and plum slide quickly through the mid-palate and on into a soft finish. A faint wash of leather and earth wraps it up.
Hints of apricot mingle in the red fruit aromas of this fresh rosé sparkler. The mousse is foaming but the palate has a bitter edge. Dryness and structure mean that this will fare better with earthy food.
This is a soft wine on the surface, but under that generosity lies a firm core that gives the promise of aging. This powerful wine comes from stony soil which explains the tannic structure while the richness comes from ripe berry fruits. Drink from 2017.
This single-vineyard wine has great aging potential. The minerality and tension in this wine with its apple fruit and texture is still resolving itself. Wait at least until 2019 before drinking.
Whiffs of pine forest lend a pristine alpine feel to this bold dry Riesling. The palate is concentrated, with sun-streaked tones of pineapple and peach balanced by bristling lemon-lime acidity. The finish is moderately long with a lingering honeycomb note.
A blend of Shaw and Boushey vineyards, this 100% varietal wine displays aromas of bittersweet chocolate, savory herbs, an earthy funk, sawdust and woodspice. It's supple in feel, with sweet cherry and chocolate flavors that linger.
Roasted coffee aromas are tinged with cedar and cassis, but this is not a fruity wine by any measure. Instead, the focus is on damp earth and humus; the fruit and coffee notes are accents to the earthy whole. Tannins are firm and may outlast the modest fruit, so drink soon for its unconventional charm.
This wine has a layered fragrance of beeswax, acacia flower and smoke. The palate offers apricot, tropical fruit and bread crust and a hint of honey. It's elegant, but also has the structure to accompany most entrees as well as cured meats and cheese.
Impressive for the volume of its flavor, which is all intensely concentrated mountain blackberries and cassis, with an interesting and savory salty earthiness of green olives. Beautifully oaked, too, so sweet and refined in toast. But those notorious Diamond Mountain tannins are gigantic, and the wine needs serious cellar time. Stash until 2014, and the drinkabiity window could last for an additional ten years.
While there is some spice here, the wine is more dominated by its acidity, fresh pear and crisp texture. It's lively, fragrant and probably best as an apéritif.
This pure Cabernet Franc is bursting with black cherry and chocolate goodness. There are streaks of smoke and light charcoal, giving this medium-bodied wine more heft and a strong finish.
Subtle toast and black-cherry flavors anchor this solid example of Marlborough Pinot. Finishes lean and dry, with firm acidity and a touch of greenness.
Here's a ripe and soft expression of Roero Riserva with jammy notes of strawberry and raspberry folded within drying aromas of black mineral and exotic spice. Those telltale tannins are present although this expression is slightly more supple and plush.
Leesy vanilla aromas are bland and don't amount to much. The palate follows suit, with additional briny melon flavors.
An impressively dark, powerfully structured and deeply flavored wine, this Malbec brims with explosive blackberry, black currant, crushed peppercorn and leather flavors. With its big-time tannins and dry, balanced mouthfeel, it's a great wine for steak.
This is fresh, light and very crisp. Citrus fruits dominate the grassy, herbaceous texture. There is perfumed white-currant acidity on the finish.
Balance and complexity are the hallmarks of this Cab from veteran producer Hanna. It's deep and long in spicy, oaky blackberry and cherry fruit, while the structure is defined by soft tannins and good acids. Delicious now, and should hold for a decade.
Made in a dry, earthy style, this wine chooses elegance and structure over dazzling opulence. And that's just fine. It has a good core of blackberry and currant fruit, and the balance suggests some time in the cellar. Give it 3–4 years.
A little too soft and sweet to earn a higher score, this shows simple flavors of cherries, licorice and cola.
Lovely and fresh, this piles on flavors of Bosc pear, with the texture to match. It's a wonderful expression of the grape coming from the eastern Washington region, accented with lovely, delicate baking spices.
Full bodied and verging on soft, this unusual Pinot Blanc from a biodynamic producer shows only modest levels of fruit, but ample weight and texture. Hints of almonds and lacings of licorice add interest.
Like most young Hunter Valley Semillons, this is starting out on the neutral, acidic side. Notes of melon and citrus rind only hint at the potential to be found in a few years' time. It's a little weightier than expected, with a silky mouthfeel and a long, gentle, lime-riddled finish.
Forward berry aromas are more clean and fresh than complex. On the palate, this is similar, with bold, freshening acidity. Flavorwise, this leans into the black-fruit spectrum, while mint, spice and peppery flavors grace the finish.
This Barolo offers subdued but textbook Nebbiolo aromas of rose, wild cherry and truffle. The palate shows juicy wild cherry notes layered with spice and cinnamon, and it's nicely balanced and fresh. It's fast approaching ideal drinkability so enjoy it over the next few years.
Enticing aromas of rose, strawberry and baking spice meld together in the glass while the creamy, delicious palate doles out juicy wild cherry, black raspberry and cinnamon. It's bright and polished, with round, smooth tannins that make this already accessible.
This is crystalline Vernaccia with bright aromas of pear, citrus and a touch of white peppercorn or natural rubber. It goes down in a fresh and clean manner and ends with a citrus crispness.
Sourced from Willamette and Umpqua Valley vineyards, this sweetly spicy wine carries a streak of orange peel and flesh. The pretty cherry fruit is fresh and tasty, and for an everyday bottle of Oregon Pinot, it's right on the money.
Attractively fruity, this wine is soft and full of juicy apple flavors that are given an extra lift by orange zest and lively, upfront acidity. The wine is still young and full of exuberant fruit. Wait until late 2017 for it to broaden out.
90-92 Barrel sample. Very tight green flavors, herbaceous, with lively fresh fruits, but restrained into a taut, mineral jacket.
This is a rich and perfumed wine. Packed with tarry tannins, dark black fruits and hints of truffles, it is firm and full. The structure is still important in this wine, pushing forward around the fruit. Wait a while to drink from 2018.
This creative blend—52% Sangiovese, 36% Syrah, 12% Mourvèdre—is sharp, peppery and tart. It livens up the palate, begs for a juicy burger, and shows some Euro style. RIOT is an anagram of the winery name.
On first impact, the wine is earthy smelling with dim tones of Brie and Camembert. Wait a few minutes, and spicy blueberry notes to appear. Overall, this is a simple, no-fuss wine that would pair well with risotto or pasta.
Hard to believe that this Chilean icon is now in its 17th year. We recall back in the early '90s when it was just getting going at well under $20 a bottle. With this wine look for potent, almost buttery oak propping up ripe berry fruit. In the folds are notes of tobacco, earth, mineral and mushroom. Tannic on the tail, with some overt wood that needs to find its place. Hold of at least a year.
Black cherry and wild berry aromas are tight and don't stray much from center stage. The palate is layered, fresh and spunky, with flavors that match the bouquet in that cherry, wild berry and plum run the show. Toasty and chocolaty on the finish, with a rock-solid feel and bright fruit flavors that don't quit.
Dense to the eye, then fully oaked and extracted on the nose, this beefy Malbec smells like coconut and blackberry. The palate is the same: jammy and extracted. Meaty berry flavors are heaped with a ton of oak, while the finish is syrupy and mighty tannic. Drink through 2020.
Crisp-tart tangerine, nectarine and pineapple abound on this fruity, forward Chardonnay. While moderate in body and alcohol, it feels plump and silky on the palate and finishes with a touch of lingering warmth. Drink now through 2020.
A good wine, comprised of fruit from vineyards scattered across Santa Barbara County. It's bone dry and crisp in acidity, and also pretty oaky. The underlying fruit flavors are of apricots and pears, with perhaps a touch of botrytis. Ready to drink now.
Fleshy oily aromas of orange peel and white flowers lead to a chunky, citric palate that's more full and blocky than elegant. Briny orange and tart nectarine flavors finish plump.
Give this beauty 3-4 years in the cellar, and if you can't, at least decant it for hours before serving. It's a beautiful young Pinot Noir, very dry and as silky as satin in the mouth, showing ripe, oak-inspired flavors of cherries, raspberries, cocoa, cola and spices. Shows the elegant acidity and structure of this wonderful vintage on the Sonoma Coast.
Initially this wine is flat and a bit chemical on the nose, but with time lime and tropical fruit aromas poke through. The mouthfeel is round but a little bland and broken up, while flavors of yeasty, bready tropical fruits and applesauce finish easy but flabby.
The region of Lazio is making promising inroads into quality wine production. The Cesanese d'Affile grape is a protagonist of this new promise, offering unique aromas of raspberry, dried herb, oregano and Christmas spice.
Sourced from Coyote Canyon in the Horse Heaven Hills, this wine offers aromas of honeysuckle and peach along with a light vanilla accent. It's full bodied and somewhat viscous in feel with abundant apricot flavors.
Robust pineapple and peach flavors are juicy and concentrated in this uncomplicated, tasty wine. It's medium-sweet in style, brightened by a lemon candy zestiness that lingers on the finish. Drink now.
This is a young, soft and fruity wine, with ripe black fruits that are lightly textured by the dry, spicy core. With some wood aging, the wine has a toasty accent and a smooth character that makes it ready to drink now.
Heat, cherry and peppery, herbal aromas get it going, followed by murky, herbal flavors and a hard feel. The finish is quite herbal, and there's more than an accent of tomato. Also a touch bitter. Run-of-the-mill Merlot at best.
While concentrated black-cherry flavors shine brightly, this herbaceous wine suggests a leaner, more savory expression of Long Island Pinot Noir. Bright acidity and firm tannins maintain a taut, tight feel.
Yalumba has been pushing the organic envelope in recent years, and this Shiraz is a winner. It's full bodied and supple nearly to the point of creaminess, but delivers mixed berry, vanilla and baking-spice flavors, all with a certain amount of elegance. Drink now–2022.
92-94 Sweet and juicy, a wine that has the potential to be delicious. The tannins are certainly prominent, although with good sweetness. Finally very structured.
Resiny and heavily toasted at first, with a full, resiny, chunky palate that carries all the weight that ultraripe fruit and new oak can bring. Offers sweet, tropical flavors, primarily banana and honey. Powerful, super sweet and woody throughout.
The Bongiovanni is a modernist take on Barbera; it is a big, ripe wine, spiced with oak. With some time in the glass, it showed complexity, with flavors of violets and smokiness but the fruit still dominated. There was a slight hollowness two thirds in, but the wine came back and finished with some aplomb.
Good wine, especially if you like some new oak that brings a lot of cream, vanilla and chocolate to the game. Along the way there's plenty of boysenberry, blueberry and other sweet dark-fruit flavors. A winner that should meet the expectations of many.
Brilliantly aromatic, this wine beguiles with exotic scents of plum pudding, spice cake, cherry compote, pipe tobacco, red licorice and raspberry jam. All that and more can be tasted—the wine is a riot of fruits and baking spices. This makes the best possible case for Mourvèdre as a stand-alone varietal wine here in Washington.
Almost too ripe and fruity, with jammy, pie-filling blackberry and cherry flavors. Lots of oak, too, giving the wine a caramelized sweetness. A bit heavy-handed, but tasty. Drink now.
This is a big and brooding wine, with a lot of aromas and flavors going on all at once: black currant liqueur, anise, cured meat, black plum, sweet spice and dark chocolate. The mouth is full and firmly structured, with intensely concentrated dark fruit character that evolves into a chicory-infused finish.
For the moment, this is rather hard and tight, with notes of black pepper around tangy berry fruit. There are interesting streaks of iron and graphite, and a balanced structure that suggests extended cellaring may be an option. This blend is 61% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Merlot, 11% Cabernet Franc and 6% Malbec.
Familiar aromas of herbs and olive make up the nose along with berry scents and hints of tree bark and mocha. A choppy palate is shrill with tartaric acidity. Spicy berry and plum flavors turn lean on a scrubbing finish.
Notes of raisins, dried prunes and chocolate mark this dry, tannic Cabernet. It's pretty acidic, with a sharp finish that contains heat from the high alcohol. Drink up.
Plenty of oak off the bat, which is what deviates this wine from the brand's standard $8 Cab. Frankly, we prefer the cheaper one; this is lemony and overcrowded with coffee and mocha characteristics. The flavors of cherry and wild raspberry are decent, but the balance is sketchy and the oak and acidity seem elevated for what it is.
Dry and crisp in acidity, with citrus flavors, but fundamentally unripe. It has a strong streak of green chlorophyll, mint and ammonia that could charitably be described as gooseberry.
If you are looking for wild flavors, then this wine is for you. It is dry, but smells sweet, with lychee, green candy and aromatic spices. It's a wine with a terrific character, needing cheeses and rich fish dishes to bring out its full potential.
Joe Dobbes was the winemaker for this Riesling, fashioning an intense and focused wine, with a bit of sweetness but ample acidity to balance it out. It's a deft combination of grapefruit, tangerine, lemon oil and a hint of mint, with impressive length and penetration.
This was somewhat disappointing, lots of structure but little or no fruit. On the palate the flavors were muted; the wine seemed dull, and it finished softly and with little impact.
An easy blend of Pinot Bianco, Tai and Manzoni Bianco, this is a fresh, crisp white wine with aromas of white flower, sambuca and citrus.
Named for Romanus Albrecht, the founder of the winery in the 15th century, this is a lightly spiced wine. Its round fruit is given an edge by pepper and light acidity. The aftertaste confirms it as a bone-dry wine.
Abacela's tenth vintage of Tempranillo suggests it's time to call the “experiment” a success. It's savory and scented with cured meats; a spicy red that marries black currant fruit to pepper and more exotic spices—curry, cumin and five spice. Tannins are tongue-scrapingly dry, but is there a better match for a thick steak?
Somewhat and pleasingly feral on the nose, this county-wide blend shows wild cherry, composting rose petals, roast game and campfire on the nose. Black-plum skins come to the fore on the sip, which is quite tangy and a bit sour, lifted by dried thyme, rich mulberry and earthy chaparral scrub.
Bottled at four years old, this wine has retained all its fruitiness. Bright plum flavors go with the dusty tannins and sweetness to create a generous wine with plenty of room for fruit acidity. Drink now, but the wine could age a couple of years.
This is an assertive Pinotage with a lusty edge of smoke and leather. The nose exhibits spicy red fruit and pepper and the flavors have a masculine, rustic character of spice and tobacco. Unique, intriguing, and a winner with equally robust dishes.
Dry and delicately structured, this is a high-acid, fairly austere wine. The flavors of tobacco, tart cherry skins and pepper will seem insufficient to fans of fruit-driven wines, but give this Dolcetto the right Italian-inspired fare, and it will shine.
Alluring on the nose, with a ton of dried spice, mocha and tobacco aromas to go with beefy, berry fruit notes. Despite its darkness and size, this wine delivers bright, juicy acidity and then herbal cassis and berry flavors. Tobacco, herbs and length define the finish. A blend of five red grapes, including Mourvèdre and Petit Verdot; drink now through 2013.
This exudes funky aromas, suggesting sweaty leather. In the mouth it turns softly sweet and hot in alcohol.
Rounded wine, softly fruity. Its attractiveness comes from ripe white fruits, soft structure and a generous feel. It's not for aging and can be drunk now.
Floral notes of rose hips and hibiscus dominate this wine along with essences of petrol and white gumdrop. Off-dry and oily, flavors of sweet stewed peaches and spiced applesauce abound on the palate. Given the weight and viscosity, crisper acidity is needed to liven things up.
There's a high-tone brightness of cassis and plum in this juicy, estate wine. A fruity character balances well against savory leather and black pepper that ride a thick wave of tannin.
Vivid aromas of toasted bread, butter and white pepper lead to more oak-related notes on the palate, where flavors reminiscent of vanilla and nutmeg are backed by light lemon and apple notes. This bold, dry wine offers plenty of oaky character.
Plenty of coffee and toast on the nose, which also pumps olive and some green bean. The palate is firm, with encoding tannins. Flavors of cassis and black cherry are convincing, but there's also some green to the package. Structured to age but probably won't improve much. Imported by Remy Cointreau USA.
The model all-market wine, with popularity that seems to have no boundaries. In this vintage, it delivers crushed berry and spicy anise aromatics, richness, mouthfeel and a tasty medium-length finish. A wine for the grill, a party, you name it—this Shiraz shows no faults. It's a crowd-pleaser deluxe. Best Buy.
Keep your eye out for this producer and his elegant Russiz Superiore Pinot Grigio that delivers top marks in terms of fruitiness and freshness. Loads of fruit from melon to apple to pineapple, with solid weight in the mouth. Imported by Della Terra.
The flavors are pure and delicious, suggesting jasmine tea, strawberries, citrus fruits, rose-hip tea, smoky dough and cinnamon. Dry, clean and elegant; the mouthfeel could be a little smoother, though.
In a hot vintage like 1998, Kumeu's proprietary blend of Merlot (65%), Malbec (30%) and Cabernet Franc (5%) gets ripe enough to avoid any suggestion of weediness. Strong cinnamon notes from new oak complement plush black-cherry fruit. Anise and leather nuances spice up the finish.
Made with Sangiovese and small amounts of Colorino and Mammolo, this Vino Nobile riserva offers berry and cinnamon aromas with hints of oak. The palate delivers ripe cherry layered with chocolate and vanilla but the tannins and acidity are already evolved so drink soon.
While the pretty pale salmon color is enough to draw anyone in, this sparkler delivers with delicate aromas of white raspberry, red apple flesh and broche. The tingling mouth, loaded with acidity and moderate carbonation, delights with flavors of strawberry hull and clementine supremes. An excellent choice for the next time you're looking to celebrate, or just treat yourself.
Recognized by its eye-catching orange label, Piccini's Chianti is the kind of wine you'll want to pack in your picnic basket or backpack for outdoor excursions. The wine is bright, compact and its lightweight mouthfeel won't weigh you down.
Aromas of grilled bell peppers and soy sauce accompany whiffs of tire rubber. The palate shows muddled flavors of caramelized onion, espresso, and ripe black currants and blackberry alongside fleeting tannins. It finishes on a sugary note.
Peach, pear and white mushroom appear on a well-balanced nose that is very attractive, albeit less intense than some others. This sparkler delivers fine and persistent perlage, toasted flavors and a silky mouthfeel. Imported by Blavod Extreme Spirits.
Tart red cherries and cassis are flecked with ceder and Graham-cracker crumbs on this lush, velvety red blend. It's opulent on the palate with warm tones of cassis liqueur marked by cocoa and spice, but balanced with pert acidity. It's a regal wine that should continue to show well till at least 2018.
A bit richer than expected, with a slightly oily mouthfeel and mineral and honey aromas. Flavors favor superripe pears, accented by subtle notes of pepper and clove, but finishing clean. Imported by Hand Picked Selections.

The aromas of this Chardonnay are zesty and fresh yet rich, with barrel smoke, caramelized pear and vanilla tones. The integration continues on the palate, with a bit of oak followed by apple, white peach, nectarine and lime zest. It's flavorful and enjoyable now.
Firm and rich wine, with the black fruits melding well with the tannins. It has plenty of structure, but that is still at a youthful stage. The final acidity adds freshness and brings in berry fruits.
This is essentially a Bordeaux blend, based on Cabernet, but the winery put in some Syrah. It's very delicious and forward in blackberry, blueberry and chocolate flavors. The tannins are as soft and sweet as Napa gets, making the wine drinkable now.
There's a unique quality to this wine that recalls bramble, forest floor, cola and small berry fruit. The wine is big and intense with succulent, chewy tannins and sweet tea flavors.
This shows the superhigh alcohol that Zins from this vineyard often achieve. It's bone dry, but it has a heaviness and heat that make it Port-like, with black currant, prune and dark chocolate flavors.
Oak, toast and dark-skinned berry aromas lead the nose. The brawny, one-dimensional palate offers dark berry, espresso, mint, anise, mocha and orange peel alongside bracing tannins. You'll also detect the warmth of alcohol on the finish.
An odd mix of apricot, melon, oak spice and herbaceousness leads to a chunky palate with green flavors and forceful woody notes. A flat, pickled-tasting finish fails to bring this around.
This wine epitomizes the lush ripeness of the 2009 vintage, yet does so without going over the top into dried fruit. Instead, it delivers brandied cherries spiced with cinnamon and clove, plus a touch of chocolate. It's full bodied and maybe just a bit warm, but the long finish is textured like fine suede. Drink now–2020.
Hard, tough in tannins, and unrewarding. There's not enough cherry and currant fruit to break through the astringency and give you a reason to drink it.
Consistent with many other Timothy Malone Pinots, this artfully melds black cherry fruit with a broad streak of cola and refreshing minerality. There's a touch of black licorice and impressive balance throughout.
Made with Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon in equal parts, this offers subtle aromas of black currant and licorice. The concentrated approachable palate provides plum, vanilla and French oak alongside chewy tannins.
Lush and ripe, made in the modern California cult style of flamboyantly sweet blackberries, cassis and chocolate, soft tannins and immediate appeal. Defines richness and opulence, if not complexity. Drink now–2014.
This Riserva from Calabria offers sweet aromas of Christmas spice and candied fruit backed by tobacco and tealeaf. It also offers earthy flavors of ripe fruit and prunes and ends with slightly astringent and sour tannins. Pair it with something sweet such as pasta with gorgonzola or piquant cheese.
This one-barrel bottling is quite intriguing, offering unexpected aromas and flavors. An element of crunched grapeseeds and unfermented wine grapes mixes with licorice, olive and pepper on the nose. A similar sense pervades the palate, along with light coffee and brown tea flavors. It's slightly odd, but also an interesting change of pace.
Oak, underbrush, tobacco and stewed plum aromas lead the nose. The palate offers roasted coffee bean, vanilla, espresso and licorice alongside astringent but not very persistent tannins.
Ripe fruit, strawberry marmalade, spice and BBQ sauce characterize this mature expression of Amarone by Domenico Fraccaroli. The wine is sweet and creamy in the mouth but that overripe note of jammy fruit appears once more in the mouth.
Crisp raspberry flavors give this Barthe family wine an attractive fruitiness and acidity. It is light on the palate, still tight and needs a few more months. Drink from 2016.
Well oaked. You pick up on the charry smoke and vanilla right away. But then the fruit hits, all ripe figs and sweet green grasses and lemons and limes and even hints of pineapple. With the fresh acidity, it all combines to a big, lush wine, with a clean, food-friendly scour.
Is this Australia's answer to Beaujolais? The sweet black cherries are accented by tart red berries fore (on the nose) and aft (on the finish). Some sweet caramel flavors and negligible tannins make this easy to gulp. Best Buy.
From a ranch planted originally in 1926 this is a knockout wine, exotically spiced and nuanced in pepper, cinnamon and a distinction of sandalwood. High-toned fruit provides a lift to the lushness that wants to dominate, but never does, allowing the tangy orange and blackberry to speak quietly and clearly.
This is powerful, ripe and creamily smooth, bearing yellow fruits that dominate the wood aging. It's a rich medley of apricot and yellow peach flavors, laced with citrusy acidity. Full, complex and generous, this is worth aging for over four years.
With notes of buttered toast, honey and vanilla cream, this Chardonnay is overpowered by new oak barrel influences. Beneath that are delicious fruit flavors of pineapples, oranges, pears and apricots. Rich and flashy in the popular style, with good acidity, but the heavy hand of oak limits the score.
This opens with aromas of espresso, leather, prune, toasted hazelnut and a whiff of dark spice. The palate is evolved, showing roasted coffee bean, raisin and licorice alongside somewhat astringent tannins. You'll also note a green sensation of powdered sage on the close.
Like a bouquet made of different types of flowers, this polished wine brings diverse elements into a pleasing whole. There are ripe tropical fruit, vanilla and butter aromas, rich apple and pear flavors, a soothing smooth texture and lingering finish.
I love how translucent in color this Pinot pours, confirmation of the light, elegantly silky texture that is such a varietal pleasure. The flavors are anything but shy. The powerful cherry, cola, rhubarb, cola and spice flavors battle it out through the long finish, and the wine is commandingly dry. May hold for some years, but it's best now with a  lamb chop.
Somewhat neutral on the nose, with light cherry and raspberry aromas. Solid in the mouth, with slightly clacky tannins and flavors of earthy red fruits, light oak and earth. Just ripe and racy enough on the finish, with a calm, reserved personality.
Lamborn has a knack for Zinfandel grown on Howell Mountain. The 2011 is dry, tannic and high in alcohol, but also concentrated with flavors of currants, blackstrap molasses, licorice and cedar. It could benefit from some time in the bottle so hold until 2016.
This is an impressive wine from a new producer. It's aromatically expressive in notes of ripe apple, star fruit and pear, with lemon-pith accents. The melon and citrus flavors are rounded, fresh and clean, offering a great balance of acidity.
Strong grassy aromas and flavors come with an almost sweet feel in the mouth in this medium-bodied, rather soft-texured white wine. It's blended from Viognier, Chardonnay and French Colombard, and it's hard to say which one it resembles most.
Earthy aromas of wild berry, underbrush, leather and a whiff of game follow over to the youthfully austere palate along pomegranate, star anise and clove. Taut tannins and vibrant acidity provide the backbone. Racy, focused and a bit on the lean side, this needs time to unwind and fully open. Drink after 2023.
The odd but endearing Riesling trait of petrol stands out in the aroma of this light-bodied and dry wine, while the flavors are more like apple juice with a touch of honey and earthiness. The mouthfeel is smooth, and a little richness lingers on the finish.
Simple, clean and fresh, this no-fuss Pinot Grigio would pair nicely against Chinese take-out or an outdoor salad lunch. It shows clean aromas of citrus and white peach.
This already mature wine starts off with aromas of herbs and beet greens, then quickly turns leathery with exposure to air. Flavors of leather, dried fruit and decay are a bit lean and astringent. Although the fruit seems to be departing rather precipitously, there's sufficient complexity to merit interest.
Aromas of orange peel and citrus pulp are oily but not oaky. This is chunky and seems to be starting to fade. Salty citrus flavors are mild, while controlled saltiness persists on the finish. Drink now.
This is a concentrated wine, full with dry tannins and perfumed red fruits. Hints of the wood aging give the wine toast and smokiness. The fresh fruits form a contrast offering a future of fragrance and stylishness. It needs to age, so wait until 2019.
This is a new brand from veteran Don Sebastiani & Sons, and it's a a bottle of easy-drinking deliciousness. Mellow and smooth, it shows cherry pie, sandalwood and white pepper flavors.
Sweet, tart and simple, like the filling on a black-cherry pie. Not much else going on. Drink now.
Sàgana shows its best qualities in the 2008 vintage. It opens with a dark, inky appearance and thick aromas of red cherry, chocolate, espresso bean and dark spice. It's a bold and concentrated wine, with savory endnotes of soy and Teriyaki sauce.
Smells attractive, with hints of vanilla and cocnut layered over toast and apple, and the flavors are in the same vein--apples and citrus, with a bit of an earthy, mushroomy note underneath--but this sample lacked the zip and crispness of a really top-flight sparkler.
Aromas of red berry, blue flower, tilled soil, menthol and a smoky whiff of flint swirl around the glass. On the vibrant linear palate, notes of licorice and white pepper accent sour cherry and pomegranate while a graphite note closes the finish. This is elegant and balanced, with youthfully firm tannins and bright acidity.
Douro white grape mix is joined by the Arinto in this attractive, soft wine. It is warm, fruity and with gentle acidity. Drink this refreshing wine now.
Whiffs of pressed apple intensify on the palate along with shades of smoked nuts, stone and steel in this deeply mineral wine. It's honeyed and slick on entry, yet bristled by a shock of lime acidity that rallies the finish endlessly.
Clarksburg might be called the Chenin Blanc capital of California, and this polished wine shows why. It's completely dry and mouthwateringly crisp in acidity, with interesting flavors of citrus fruits, ripe fresh green beans, spices and vanilla. Try as an alternative to Pinot Grigio or Sauvignon Blanc.
This is a bright and luminous Italian sparkler that would pair well with white meat, roasted fish and vegetables. Aromas are clean and bright and the wine offers a fresh, tonic feel in the mouth.
There's a very cool minerality on the nose of this wine, followed by notes of green fruit, white currant and fresh hay on the nose and mouth. Medium weight in the mouth with bracing acidity and a clean, lingering finish.
Sunny whiffs of Meyer lemon and peach turn zestier on the palate of this dry Riesling. It's a delightfully quaffable wine marked by cutting mineral intensity. Drink now through 2019.
This rare varietal bottling has lightly volatile aromas of Dimetap, raspberries, woodspice and herbs. Cranberry, raspberry and rose-hip flavors are full bodied and show purity. Drink now.
Feeble scents of tropical fruit and rose petal mark the nose of this wine, which leads into the light- to medium-bodied palate that offers bright acids, soft flavors and a delicate, tapering finish.
Aromas of vanilla, cocoa and dark berries lead to full-bodied and velvety coffee, cherry and dark fruit flavors. The oak plays prominently but this wine is still pretty hard to resist.

This release represents a gigantic leap forward for Oberon in their basic Cabernet Sauvignon. Past releases have been so-so. This one's terrific.

It's dry, full-bodied and impressively ripe in blackberries, currants, licorice and oak, with a long, smooth finish.
Ruby red with garnet hues in color, this easy-drinking Merlot brings aromas of cherry, black berry and black raspberry on the nose. Tones of black plum and black cherry are ripe and persistent on the finish.
There's a reason few wineries nowadays produce Barbera. It's a boring wine, and just because it comes from as fine a producer as Reverie can't change that fact. The wine is dry, tannic and dull, with unevenly ripened flavors.
With light spiciness, this is a full-bodied wine, dominated by tropical fruits. It is rich, rounded, soft, with touches of honey.
Cherry and plum, chocolate and peppery herbs combine here in a well-structured wine with some years of life ahead. Aged in one-third new French oak for 11 months, it will reward decanting or aeration if you are drinking it in the next year or two.
A supremely ripe Port from Ramos-Pinto's vineyard in the far east of the Douro. It is finely perfumed, with layered tannins upon structured plum skins and black cherry fruit. It's in a fruity style, but the structure certainly promises aging.
The parcel called La Mission in the heart of the Mercurey vineyards is wholly owned by the Devillard family, so they call it a monopoly. It is a wine that effortlessly balances tangerine and lemon flavors with ripe spiced peaches and a tight mineral texture. The wine is still young, still developing, so wait until 2018.
This Chambourcin has medium-intense aromas of chocolate-covered cherries, dill and caramel popcorn. The medium-bodied palate feels limp due to soft tannins and languid acids.
There's a unique note here of mature fruit, chopped basil or peppermint with a hint of spice or chopped white peppercorn. The bubbling seems less frothy and the wine has a flat, big feel in the mouth. Grapes were farmed organically and the wine is from the 2007 vintage, which may explain its distinctive style.
This attractive, herbal wine has intense fruitiness but misses any sense of place. It has appealing white currant and grapefruit flavors and a tight finish of acidity. Drink now.
Brooding aromas of vanilla, mocha and herb lead to a palate full of fresh acids and firm, but not unrelenting tannins. It's an intriguing example of the variety.
The nose opens with a hint of oak that leads to flowery musk. Straightforward in the mouth, with evergreen and hints of white fruit.
A blend of 45% Cabernet Sauvignon, 38% Merlot, 10% Cabernet Franc and 7% Petit Verdot, this opens with aromas of red currant, fragrant purple flower and exotic spice. The currant aroma carries over to the austere palate along with cranberry, chopped herb and French oak. With its backbone of firm acidity and assertive close-grained tannins, it already boasts finesse but will need years to soften and develop. Drink 2021–2028.
A good, dry Cabernet whose fruit flavors are balanced with rich tannins. Offers upfront flavors of blackberries, cherries, raspberries and cocoa. Good price, considering the elegance
Hints of bramble and smoke add savoriness to fresh apple and pear flavors in this almost-dry Riesling. The palate is piercingly high in acidity, but zesty lemon and lime flavors are bright and invigorating.
Lilacs and wisteria combine for a floral and approachable nose in this clonal study, which is also loaded with clove, peppercorn, rosemary and elderberry aromas. It's soft and lush on the palate, with rich plum and black cherry flavors leveled by notes of anise, potpourri, fresh mint and Earl Grey tea.
Sweet-tasting, jammy raspberry and cherry flavors abound in this Merlot. It should be easy to drink with burgers, enchiladas or ribs slathered in barbecue sauce.

Cranberry, sour cherry, turned earth, dewy chaparral and anise aromas arise on this bottling from the historic Monterey producer. The mouthfeel is quite full, with sour cherries, leather, tobacco and mocha flavors cut by a judicious amount of acidity.
Round and nutty, with mild floral and honey hints up front. The formula for Tio Pepe calls for a salty, crisp flavor profile with just enough complexity to thrust it into the upper echelon of finos. Slight mushroom and iodine notes appear on the finish.
This is ripe and raisiny on the nose, with marmalade, spice cake and ripe berry aromas. Oddly, this feels raw and abrasive, given the dark-leaning aromas. While it shows baked black-fruit flavors, it's tannic, sassy and snappy.
Very ripe and fruity, a Chardonnay that trades sheer opulence for subtlety or complexity. Offers oak-inspired flavors of buttered toast, pineapple Lifesaver candy, lemondrop and vanilla crème brûlée in a creamy texture.
Already developed, with hints of toast and marmalade on the nose and showing baked apple and citrus flavors on the palate. This plump, medium-bodied Riesling finishes with a touch of honeyed softness, suggesting it should be consumed over the next year.
Composed of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon from the biodynamic En Cerise Vineyard, and 40% Syrah from Seven Hills. The fruit has a touch of the good funk the French call gout de merde, and the wine has a big spine of tarry tannin. This is tight and ageworthy; if you drink it soon you'd best decant it early.
The wine is warm and round, full of ripe berry fruits and soft tannins. It's ready to drink now with its full structure, balanced acidity and juicy aftertaste.
Perfumed, ripe local white grapes are the backbone of this soft, full-bodied wine. It's rich, full of yellow fruits and plums. Spice gives a touch of pepperiness that is then cut by the final acidity. It's attractive now, but will be better from 2016.
A strongly flavored, candied sparkling wine, made from the classic varieties of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. Seems overextracted, like a raspberry, almond and honey power bar, with the yeastiness and bubbly sparkles of Champagne.
Despite the plural on the “vineyards” designation, the source of this Chardonnay is one vineyard. It's dry, crisp and minerally, with tantalizing lemon, lime, mango and apricot flavors, finished with a French oak toastiness.
Less defined notes of ripe pear or plum framed by earthy, yeasty notes are toned by citrus freshness. This is concentrated,         punchy and finishes with lip-smacking citrus.
This cheerful Prosecco delivers pretty floral tones and delicate peach intensity. The texture is lean and compact and the wine offers bright acidity on the close: Pair it with appetizers and finger foods to enjoy on a sunny afternoon.
An impressively ripe wine, full of Cabernet Franc trademarks, such as spice, fruitcake and red berry fruits. It is structured, firm, hinting at wood, and finishing with bright acidity.
This is small-production, old-vines Cariñena with the full allotment of French oak aging. It is a little syrupy on the nose, but its schisty blackberry and licorice aromas and flavors give it a Priorat quality. What's holding it back is jumpy acidity that brings the mouthfeel down a notch or two. Best with food.
This taut, nervy wine has tight structure and acidity. It's very crisp and dry to taste, offering intense green apple and lemon zest. The wine will be even better in 2–3 years.
Horsey, grassy berry aromas are unconvincing. This is plump but also edgy in feel, with a pronounced but weird buttery oak flavor and marginal fruit character. A leafy, oaky finish includes notes of stalky berry and plum.
Ripe, velvety notions of juicy pear and pear peel perfume the subtle nose. The palate has the same, bright, friendly but utterly balanced juiciness that is immensely appetizing. The palate is dry and lithe and has a fine acidic backbone of lemony freshness.
Vinified in California with grapes purchased from Willamette Valley sources, this is a pleasant, quaffable wine, with simple red fruit and grippy acids. The flavors seem to get stuck in the back of the throat, a bottleneck of acid and red berry. Don't look for the breadth or sweetness of California Pinot Noir here, but you will find texture and nuance.
There is really nothing forbidden about this wine. It's just off-dry and particularly gentle on the palate. The wine is light and fresh with pepper and tropical fruit fragrance. It's very ready to drink. Screwcap.
The vineyard, in interior Mendocino, has produced a lush, compelling Syrah in this warm vintage. The fruit is perfectly ripe, bringing cherries and blackberries to the edge of liqueur, while maintaining complete dryness, with no trace of raisins and relatively modest alcohol. Combines weight with elegance to produce an upscale Syrah.
A black color and baked ripe-fruit aromas are the greeting on this second wine to Clos Apalta. While this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Carmenère, Merlot and Petit Verdot feels soft along the edges, it's propped up by tartaric acidity. Blackened flavors of saturated blackberry and cassis maintain lush ripeness across the finish. Drink through 2020.
At less than 14% abv, this reflects a growing sensibility within Barossa. It's a medium- to full-bodied wine with supple tannins and a refreshing, moreish finish. Cinnamon and mocha notes hang from plummy fruit. Drink now–2020.
Ata Rangi isn't known for its Sauvignon Blanc—the Pinot Noir is what everyone clamors for—but perhaps it should be. This is an excellent effort, balancing pineapple and citrus fruit with a hint of grassiness. Despite being well over a year old, it remains fresh, lively and crisp, with a long, mouthwatering finish.
Sole dei Padri is a soft, opulent and elegant wine that would taste great with a sophisticated dinner of red meat and wild mushrooms. Aromas include black cherries, spice, smoked ham and white pepper.

91-93 Barrel sample. Lovely, delicious sweet fruit leads a ripe and generous wine, showing deliciously black, almost raisiny flavors. There's a pile of richness, with acidity acting as a seasoning.
This bright ten-year-old has enticing aromas of red berry, pressed rose, dark cooking spice, leather and a balsamic note.

This ripe wine has tropical fruits, pineapple and apricots as well as a fresher lime character. The wine is rounded with a crisper edge. Drink now.
Such a concentrated wine, with the intensity of red Burgundy but with the juiciness of Beaujolais. Swathes of smooth fruit wash around the palate, coupled with a touch of minerality and a dense texture. Age for 2–3 years and more.
Aromas of charcuterie, smoke and grilled herb lead the nose. On the simple palate, a note of white pepper accents a red-berry core. It's easy drinking, with fresh acidity and soft tannins.
This shows off the lovely weight and supple texture of Langhorne Creek fruit alongside bold flavors of chocolate and cassis. Despite that, there's also a nagging bit of green bell pepper that may not be to everyone's taste. Drink now.
Like many wines from this vintage, Melipal seems afflicted with 2005 blues. It has black plum and some woody char to chew on, but also saline and frisky tartness. Gets better with airing and will show best with food, but it's clearly a step down from prior years.
As sweet as honey, with Lifesaver candy pineapple, golden apricot preserves, Meyer lemon custard pie and Asian spice flavors. Calls for very rich fare, such as scallops sautéed in butter, served with a creamy risotto.
This is a smooth, wood-aged wine that's full of berry fruits and rich tannins. The wine is dark and concentrated, with a medicinal hint and a juicy element to go with the powerful structure. This should age for 4–5 years and more. Screwcap.
Narrow, pointed aromas of licorice and snappy, herbal fruits filter into a hard, tannic palate. Flavors of red berries and currants are pushed by blazing acidity, while the finish is firm as rocks and tastes a bit green and minty. For a 2005, this is showing its cards; drink now.
There's a very beautiful quality to the nose of this fresh Barbera d'Alba that opens with bright aromas of blue flower, red cherry, almond skin and cola. In the mouth, the wine shows bright acidity followed by a smooth, silky texture.
Blackberry and mature fruit emerge first and are followed by some spicy notes and a touch of distant rubber or resin. This concentrated wine is firm and solid with smooth tannins and could pair with meat or heavy pasta dishes.
There is a lot of herbal and woody nuance to the nose of this blend of 72% Grenache, 10% Syrah, 10% Mourvèdre, 5% Carignane and 3% Counoise. Thyme, dried fennel and Earl Grey tea aromas lift the dark strawberry fruit. Shaved cedar flavors frame the palate, where lavender and other purple flowers integrate seamlessly into the soft red fruit.
Classy from the get-go, with an appealing mix of strawberry preserves, anise, licorice candy, smoke and cedar. The fruit and oak are beautifully matched and laced together, and the flavors unfold with a slightly salty, mineral edge. Long, persistent and consistently interesting, right through the finishing notes of dried herb and toasted nuts.
This tastes sweeter than the very fine 2009 and 2010, but that may be because the fruit is so powerfully intense and pure. It has flavors of ripe tangerines, limes, peaches and apples, made racy by its acidity. No oak has been applied, so the wine tastes fresh.
Not much going on here besides alcohol and acidity. The fruit is thin and citrusy. A little Viognier adds modest floral notes.
Flighty and delicate on the palate, this refreshingly mineral semi-sweet wine is juicy with sweet apple flavor accented with brisk lime acidity. Hints of honey  and white flowers linger softly on the finish.
More than 10 years following the harvest, this expression from Mt. Etna is on the decline. There are pungent apple aromas that keep it going and the wine's alcoholic power fuels persistency, but ultimately there's not enough natural fruit left.
Fresh and baked apple counter each other attractively. The palate is fresh and clean, with an earthy, textured edge. Brisk lemon notes provide freshness.
A simple, soft Chardonnay from the Mâconnais region, this is rounded. A touch of caramel adds extra flavor to the warm fruit. Green plum and melon dominate this wine that is ready to drink.
This is not a particularly successful bottling. There's a minty edge to the flavor, and the thinness of fruit allows the alcohol to show as heat. On the plus side there is dryness and silkiness.
From the dreamy Mediterranean paradise known as Sardinia comes this opulent dessert blend of Nasco and Malvasia Bianca. The syrupy wine exhibits a dark amber-copper color with aromas of toasted almond, butterscotch, caramel, dried apricot and candied fruit. It shows density and grit, and yes, there's even a touch of piquant spice on the close.
All the components of fine Zinfandel are in top form here, from the opening fat, dark berry aromas to the deep, sweet fruit on the smoothly textured palate and the lovely fruit-acid balance. Closes handsomely, with full even tannins and some white pepper on the long back end. Drinks well now and has the structure to last and improve for a few years as well.
Honey and orange rind notes meld with a hint of waxy lanolin on this richly textured white wine. Savory hints of smoke and black tea are balanced with a touch of bright citrus rind and a delicate salinity that lingers on the finish.
Pale pink in the glass, this sparkling rosé (which is made from Muscat) has aromas of lavender, red cherry and dried rose petals. There are flavors of sweet raspberry and cantaloupe that are topped off with a delicately sweet finish.
Soft, opulent and plush, this Sangiovese-Merlot-Alicante from Trequanda is a well-executed wine with a thick layer of red fruit held in place by spice, caramel and chocolate fudge.
Sidewood's consulting winemaker, Nathasha Mooney (who made the still-stunning 1998 E&E; Black Pepper Shiraz while at Barossa Valley Estate), is putting together some excellent wines that also represent good value, including this grapefruit-scented Sauvignon Blanc. This medium-bodied offering is long and intense, blending citrus with minerally spice reminiscent of white pepper.
Although 2012 was a ripe, warm year, this wine is tomatoey and herbal. Stalky, salty flavors are barely acceptable.
A welcome addition to the Bunchgrass lineup, this white Bordeaux-style blend is one third barrel-fermented Semillon, two thirds tank-fermented Sauvignon Blanc. The ripe and textural fruit still shows a lightly yeasty character, along with highlights of honey graham cracker.
Gorgeous, opulent and rich, Tenuta Nuova is an unforgettable wine. It has body, power, persistence and loads of plush personality. It is layered with chocolate, cherry, blackberry, spice, leather and savory notes. There's a deep mineral layer as well. Compelling and lovely.
A fatter style of rosé, more for food than apéritif with rich strawberry flavors followed by a touch of spice, finished with caramel.
Big, ripe and delicious, this is packed with spice and sweet apricot fruits. It's full and opulent, very much a wine of 2009, yet it retains its sense of balance and structure.
This is a super Tuscan blend, based on Sangiovese. It's a rustic wine, drily tannic, with sweetish flavors of blackberries, cherries, cola and oak.
All estate grown and stainless steel fermented, this is a pale pink rosé that's packed with flavor. Watermelon and strawberry fruit flavors stand out, with plenty of citrus tang in the aftertaste.
A Cal-Ital blend of mostly Sangiovese and Bordeaux reds, this rustic country wine is forward in sweet cherry jam, sugared orange tea and vanilla flavors.
Very young and pretty tannic now with a mouth-numbing astringency, so you don't want to pop that cork tonight. But give it time. There's a deep, molten core of blackberry fruit, and the wine is dry and balanced. Should soften by 2009 and hold, if not improved, for another ten years.
About a third of this is Bien Nacido Vineyard (Santa Barbara) fruit; the rest comes from Sonoma. Plenty of cedar, earth and some cherry-tomato flavors in this fruit-forward wine. Strawberry preserves and that darn hint of tomato extend into the finish, along with a fair bit of tannin.
This wine is crisp and packed with both acidity and lively citrus fruits, balanced between fruit and freshness. It makes a good apéritif wine, light and very much in balance. The mostly red-wine property, owned by Régis and Hervé Grandeau, sits on a slope above the Right Bank of the Garonne River only four miles from Bordeaux city.
Marked by both reduction and oak, this wine feels lifted with acidity, opening in a vibrant shock of strawberry and Mandarin orange. Velvety layers subtle tannin carry a spicy finish of clove and salty sea air. A beautifully balanced, complete wine.
Rose petals, red currants, red licorice and a bit of snapped sage stick entertain the nose on this bottling, which can be sampled at the producer's downtown Paso tasting room. Earl Grey tea, dried orange rind and dried violets play on the palate, which cuts the elderberry fruit with sharp, slightly bitter cherry pits.
Poised, stylish and very fruity, this wine is fresh with acidity, showing lemon and red currant, with a touch of pepper on the finish. It's just right as an apéritif.
Over the centuries, lava flows from Mount Etna have formed natural vineyard terracing and tiny farming pockets, each characterized by a unique microclimate. The Calderara Sottana is a particularly fortunate niche that produces high quality fruit, elegant aromas and firmly polished structure. This wine is silky, long and very beautiful.
Intensely aromatic, this is Oregon Pinot at its most lush. Seductive scents lead into lengthy, balanced flavors of cherry and red plum, highlighted with green tea and tobacco notes. Tannins are smooth and proportionate, and the overall structure suggests aging this wine through 2025–2030.
Easier to find than Jeriko's Pommard or Dijon bottlings, the Reserve is dark and earthy with mushroom, dark cherry and a tiny bit of spice floating behind the scenes. The 14.7% alcohol level brings this wine into a bigger style of Pinot territory but is welldone and should get even better with time.
Very dry and fairly tannic, with interesting flavors of cherries, currants and licorice, and an earthy-tobacco note. The finish is very peppery. It's a solid, good wine with some extra qualities of elegance and depth.
This first vintage of Steven Kent's Ghielmetti Vineyard Cab is worth seeking out to see what Livermore is capable of. Ghielmetti is planted to five different clones of Cab but for this wine the winery is using only one block. The result a big, serious Cab that's concentrated with black cherry, cocoa and tobacco that will majestically develop over the next 10–12 years.
Aromas of oak, leather, plum, vanilla and espresso unfold in the glass. The concentrated palate doles out dried black cherry, blackberry jam, oak-driven spice and licorice alongside firm, fine-grained tannin. This has weight and a velvety texture but it isn't overly vibrant, so drink sooner rather than later.
A fresh, fruity wine. A little soft but full of juicy flavors of lemon, lime, peach and pear, with flowery, honeyed notes. It's pleasant rather than complex, an everyday picnic-sort-of-wine.
Quite tart, this mixes a core of cherry fruit with acidic citrus flavors adding lift. It's a lifted, high-tone wine, and the tannins carry a hint of green herbs.
While this has some lean tannins, the wine offers ripe red fruit and berry character to balance. It's structured, still young and getting its tannins together. Drink this fresh, structured and juicy wine from 2018.
This is the top wine from the Jean-Pierre Fayard family Provence cru classé estate. It is full of ripe red fruits supported by a mineral texture. The wine is generous, bone dry but packed with great fruitiness and finished with refreshing acidity. This sophisticated wine could do with a few more months, so drink from late 2017.
Rich and full bodied, this still has a tight texture of acidity and tangy orange zest. Minerality gives structure and a concentrated, bright aftertaste. It's a wine to age another year, so drink from the end of 2016.
Spicy and smoky with notes of dark red berries, rich red plum guts, tobacco and cocoa on the nose and palate. The finish is long and is loaded with roasted coffee beans, cocoa, and finally a bacony sweetness at the close. Balanced and well-integrated with firm but not overly assertive tannins. Drink now.
This biodynamic blend of Merlot and Cabernet Franc opens with an inky, dense appearance and super intense aromas of blackberry, dark spice, tobacco and dried rosemary. The wine boasts a polished and direct feel in the mouth with tight, finely structured tannins. Let it age five years or more.
Already showing prominent bricking at the rim, this medium-bodied, supple wine should be consumed by the end of 2015. Scents and flavors of mocha, caramel and decaying leaves frame attenuated red fruits.
This dark, young wine is brooding. It's hiding itself in a purple velvet cloak, revealing only hints of spicy blackberry fruit and smoked meat. The tannins are chewy, but yielding, like gum. It's a very beautiful wine that will improve for a couple years in the cellar.
This plush Tuscan Merlot (from one of Montalcino's best producers of Brunello) opens with soft and round tones of cherry, milk chocolate spice and cassis. There's an elegant richness here that would help pair this wine with game hen or risotto with wild mushrooms. Drink now.
Despite some heat and a candied, almost carbonic bouquet, this basic Toro packs a lot of punch and depth of fruit. It's absolutely, positively looking for some steak tips, cheeseburgers or spaghetti and meatballs to run up against; by itself it's ripe, ready and lusty, with sweet berry flavors, vanilla and spice.
Starting with beautifiul aromas of cassis, cocoa and coffee beans, this wine has a velvety texture and deep, ripe layers of black fruit. It does a great job of combining layers of black cherry, blackberry and cinnamon on a full body but without seeming heavy.
Rudimentary aromas of lemon-lime and apple set up a flat palate. This tastes of dried apricots before turning decidedly bitter. On the finish, flavors of dried white fruits are modest.

Made in large-enough quantities to be widely available, as well as at a rare price point for the appellation, this is a bit of a find. Juicy in red-fruit tones yet supported by drying tannins, this is pleasurably perplexing, with a hint of mint on the nose. Full bodied, it finishes with tobacco and fig. Cellar through 2020.
Soft, cherried and voluptuous. It is three-quarters Merlot, with the balance Cabernet Sauvignon. The cherry, chocolate and cassis flavors make it instantly appealing, but it has a tannic intensity that will hold it for a good five years.
A firm and tannic wine, it is still developing. The dry structure and the smoky wood aging are dominant, giving a hard feel. It does have a juicy hint underneath, so the fruit will develop although tannins are going to remain prominent.
Big, tough tannins and dark brooding fruits give this wine a great sense of restrained power. It has firm muscles, offering support to the plush blue berry, currant and dark plum skins. It need good aging, at least over three years.
This robust concentrated red is made from an unusual field blend of Sereksiya Charni and Saperavi, two grape varieties more known in Eastern Europe than the United States. It's lush in black-cherry flavor, accented with chocolate, black pepper, vanilla and spice, but also densely tannic and searing in acidity. While unwieldy in its youth, it's a wine that consistently shows excellence with maturity. Hold till 2025.
Spanish broom, orchard fruit and pistachio nut are some of the aromas you'll find on this vibrant sparkler. The lively palate offers pear, apple and citrus alongside a silky perlage.
A faint herbal note ribbons around creamy vanilla, currant and plum skin flavors. The tannins are snug and mouthcoating, carrying out to the herbal finish.

Ripe to the point of overripe, with chocolate-covered raisin flavors, this soft, rustic Merlot showcases a hot vineyard. Yet it's dry, with only modest alcohol.
Lightly gold in color, it has a touch of botrytis to give a honeyed character. The wine is full and rich, with an element of dryness at its heart.
Here's a pleasantly fragrant blend of Negroamaro and Malvasia Nera that does a good job of delivering ripe berry notes that are intense, but not exaggerated. Black pepper, clove and chili notes are present but well dosed. Pair it with pecorino cheese or braised meats.
Focused and salinic, offering mild white-flower and peach aromas, this feels full, round, fleshy and balanced, with pithy citrus, peach and almond flavors that lead nicely to a smooth, melony finish. This is about as complex as Albariño gets.
Initially austere, this wine is driven by notes of bitter chocolate and lean fruit. The fruit weight promises some attractive aging, but for the present, it is firm, dry and solidly tannic.
Alcohol gives this wine a hot aroma and taste, as well as sweetness from glycerine. The cherry fruits veer into overripe raisins. Whie the tannins are elegant, the heat limits its appeal, not to mention ageability.
An herbal and perfumed wine, its welcoming soft aromatic character comes from the Cabernet Franc in the blend. The wine has dusty tannins, rich and juicy black fruits and tamed Tannat structure, to give a ripe, full and opulent wine that will develop quickly. Drink now or, better, from 2015.
Nicely dry and crisply acidic, with a minerally scour of stone that cleans the mouth and gets the tastebuds watering. The flavors are of cool-climate lemons, lime and grapefruits. But shows a considerable note of green, feline spray that lowers the score.
Situated in the hills above Saint-Tropez, this vineyard is one of the highest in Provence. The wine has a fresh, cool character with lively acidity layered with berry and currant fruits. It is crisp, tight and as complex as a Provence rosé can be.
A huge, fruit-packed wine, made in the Shafer style of mass and potency. With 20% Cabernet Sauvignon and lots of new oak, it's explosive in black cherry, cherry liqueur and cedar flavors, with a spicy, salty umami taste, like pepperoni. Give it a decant of several hours.
Pears, apples and cream work well together in this friendly dry white. It has a weight, ripeness, but the acidity gives a lift. The finish is soft and full in the mouth.

Dense, inky and sweet on the nose, with cassis, melted Swiss chocolate and well-integrated spice aromas. The palate has size and acidity, with toasty, creamy flavors of baked black fruits and coconut. Long on the finish, with vanilla and mocha; ripe, delicious and potent. Drink now through 2016.
Mature and sound on the bouquet, but more snappy and sharp overall than you might anticipate for a 2001. Aromas of tobacco and bramble lead to flavors that you'd expect: more tobacco, dried plum, sour cherries, etc. Long and lean on the palate and finish, with pulse but a shortage of richness. It leaves you wanting more body and fruit.
This 100% varietal wine displays a mixture of fruit and barrel aromas, plus flavors of coffee, vanilla, butterscotch and cherry. It finishes candy-bar sweet ,with the oak playing a prominent part in the show.
This pale salmon rosé starts off with scents of crushed stone and underripe stone fruit, then shows riper flavors of plum and peach on the palate before ending on notes of watermelon rind and citrus. Drink up.
Birillo is a soft but straightforward red wine from southern Tuscany that would pair with roast chicken or stuffed turkey. It shows savory aromas of ripe fruit, cured meat, smoked beef and root beer.
It already has a balance between acidity and rich red berry fruits. Red cherries add extra fruitiness to this structured, ripe wine that will age well. Drink from 2017.
Aromas and flavors like mixed fruit cocktail and a rather soft texture make this a pleasant, easy-drinking wine. Medium bodied and not tart, it seems almost sweet on the finish.

This 100% Cabernet is a good wine, rich in blackberry, black currant and new oak flavors, and the tannins show that famous Stags Leap “iron fist in a velvet glove” quality. It seems a little hollow in the midpalate, reminiscent of the 2006 and 2007 vintages. Drink now–2017.
Big, bold and rich wine, solidly tannic, firm and ripe. Vivid black plum flavors scroll across the palate giving a full, firm, right up front feel. The wine has great texture, weight and density. It also has an impressive future, so drink from 2017.
A note of petrol might make you think this was Riesling, but no, it's Pinot Gris, and a fine one, with that oily note accompanying citrus, honey and white licorice flavors, leading to a dry, spicy finish. A minor criticism is that the acidity could be higher. But it will be wonderful with pan-Asian fare.
Young and vigorous, with immature primary fruit flavors of blackberries and cherries. The oak is sweet and elaborate, but unintegrated, while the tannins are perfect Napa, all rich and complicated. This fine bottle needs at least five years in the cellar to begin to come around.
Among the impressive single-vineyard Adelsheim Pinots, this is the only one from this tiny AVA. It's loaded with bright, sparky cranberry and raspberry fruit, whose juicy flavors hit the palate's bullseye. The penetrating power is underscored with minerally acidity. Drink now through 2030.
A 100% varietal wine from the mountain appellation, this bristles in spicy acidity sparked in black pepper and clove. Muscularly built, it offers generous tannin and blue fruit, alongside an element of scrubby sage and cocoa powder.
Winemaker: Rianie Strydom. A blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Shiraz, this is currently young and tight, with clamped aromas and flavors of cassis, blackberry, licorice, leather and black tea leaves. It's gripping and firmly structured, with aggressive tannins that linger long on the dry finish, alongside notes of toasted wood, espresso grinds and black cherry skin. Try after 2020 and through 2025.
96–98. Barrel sample. This powerful, impressive wine is comprised of 90% Cabernet Sauvignon.

A fine Mouton, this is the first vintage produced in the chateau's new cellar.
Dietro le Case (“behind the houses”) is a pure expression of Inzolia that opens with a pale hay color and fragrant aromas of melon, apricot and dried flowers. It's a simple, fresh wine with accents of citrus and honey.
Attractive and well put together from start to finish. This Cab (with 15% Malbec) is jammed with cassis, raspberry and other juicy berry flavors, while the lushness of the wine rolls over your palate with ease. It's not easy to find Cabernet this good in the $20 range, so get after this one while it's under the radar.
Fruity aromas of peach, nectarine and cantaloupe are just dry enough. This feels fresh and a touch citric, with mild flavors of orange and nectarine. A gentle, slightly pithy tasting finish is a good ending to this everyday rosé.
One of Italy's most lauded Cabernet Francs, this opens with aromas of new oak, cassis, crushed violet, tobacco, graphite and a whiff of espresso. The tightly wound palate delivers dried black currants, black raspberries, clove, oak-driven spice, ground pepper and grilled sage alongside assertive but polished tannins. It has structure and finesse but needs to unwind. Drink 2016–2023.
Aromas suggest leafy underbrush, espresso and toasted oak. The evolved palate offers coffee, roasted hazelnut and dried red berry alongside fleeting tannins.
This is a Grenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre blend, with a trace of Viognier. It's a big, rich, voluptuous wine, dynamic in berries and vanilla cream from oak, and the acidity must come from that 2% of Viognier. So fruity, it's almost sweet, except that it finishes with a dry flourish. Only 960 cases were produced.
From 70-year-old vines, with a low yield of tiny berries, this is a very textured, concentrated wine with a tight and mineral character. Melon and pear are shot through with intense citrus and wood flavors. It's a wine with structure, needing to age. Drink from 2017.
This special Sauvignon Blanc is only being released in top vintages. The first was the 2010; the 2013 is the second vintage. Fermented in oak, it offers up complex aromas of pencil shavings and grapefruit, followed by hints of toast, cedar, red currants and gooseberries. It's a ripe, weighty style, but it carries those traits without a hitch, gliding seamlessly through a long, silky, mouthwatering finish.
Cabernet Sauvignon makes up half of this blend from Gamache and Champoux vineyards, with the balance Merlot, Malbec and Cabernet Franc. Coffee, vanilla, herb and cherry aromas lead to dark-fruit and barrel-spice flavors that linger. The wood is up front but plenty of good things are going on.
Big in the mouth, with moderate acid, this Chardonnay got plenty ripe in the hot Stellenbosch sun. Yellow fruit flavors have a nice oaky touch, adding plenty of vanilla spice character. The nose is airy, with a straw-like character. Overall a nice wine, with some complexity for a wine of this price. Imported by Cape Classics.
Rustic and sharp, with an acidic bite to the black currant and raisin flavors. Yet it's dry and refined in tannins. Drink now.
This is a stewed, raisiny wine on the nose, while in the mouth it's more acidic and flush, but not quite elegant or sophisticated. The palate deals a short burst of heavy plum and berry flavor, and the finish is jammy and ripe but lacks complexity.
Strikingly crisp, this wine starts out with some woodsy complexity on the nose then adds raspberry and earth flavors in the mouth. A few dusty tannins peek through on the short finish. Try with pepperoni pizza.
Vinified in stainless steel, this affordable wine doesn't need new oak flavors to flesh it out. It's sharply defined, with crisp apple and pear fruit that carries a touch of spice. The length and precision are impressive.

Some ripe black-cherry and cranberry flavors chime in as well, supporting the toasted baguette, cedar and nutmeg nuances and layering seamlessly.
This wine's ripe berry aromas include integrated oak, tar and vanilla notes. Its plum, raspberry, vanilla and cream flavors are appealing, yet it finishes raw, jagged and a bit shrill.
The winemaker took a Chardonnay approach, giving the wine lots of barrel fermentation and lees aging. The result is a rich, softly textured 100% Sauvignon Blanc, with lime, kiwi and vanilla flavors, wrapped into a creamy, buttery mouthfeel.
A challenging wine. It's rather strong and dry and extracted now, lacking delicacy, and makes you want to stick it in the cellar for a while. Yet there's a certain hollowness that may limit ageability. If you drink it now, give it a good decant.
Immaculate freshness abounds in this zesty Chardonnay. While supple and quite creamy on the palate, pristine lemon and pear flavors and a vibrant backdrop of lemony acidity invigorate. Elegantly meshed vanilla and spice tones linger on the finish.
A stylish nonvintage brut, offering the right mix of character and functionality. Aromas are the standard green apple and bread dough. It’s maybe a little neutral, but the appley palate is clean, and it finishes with length and power.
This soft, fruity wine delivers honey and apricot aromas. With touches of botrytis, it has a dry, spicy edge. At the same time, it's full of bitter orange and yellow fruit. Drink from 2018.
Sharp, rubbery, stemmy aromas lead to an edgy palate with herbal, burnt, semigreen berry flavors. Finishes green and a bit weedy; acceptable but nothing to get excited over.
Outstanding as always. Right from the first take it has an elevated sense of being. The nose is rich, warm and deeply fruited, with balsam wood and lemony notes. It's deep as a coal mine on the palate, with herbal, tobacco and leather accents sprucing up serious berry fruit flavors. Minty and sly on the finish, and lovely overall. Drink now through 2016.
This is very tart and juicy, with flavors of crisp apple and unripe blackberry. It seems to have been picked early, or perhaps over cropped; it's not a bad wine by any means but the flavors have not quite ripened to perfection. They are there, but still not fully realized.
With the spice markets and romanic bazaars of North Africa not far off the coast of Sicily, Maroccoli embodies a sensual spirit with bright cinnamon and clove backed by black fruit and dried fig. The wine is rich, plush and smoothly textured.
Cherry-berry crumble topped with vanilla cream gives this wine a brambly, succulent quality, dusted in light cinnamon spice, cedar and well-integrated tannin and oak. Powerful and full-bodied, it's fruity, balanced and enjoyable now.
While the nose of this Viennese field blend is shy, the palate brims with fruit: zesty citrus, grapefruit pith and green and yellow apple. Streamlined and textured with a moreish, pervasive and brightening freshness, it tingles with herbal spice on the finish.
Yellow stone fruit, citrus and Mediterranean brush aromas float out of the glass. On the bright, tangy palate, mature apricot and nectarine flavors mingle with savory mineral notes and hints of chopped herb.
Spiced fruit, creamed apples and some ripe tangy character all work together to give a bright, peppery wine, delicious now but worth aging for 1–2 years. The wine has great intensity, but seems to float easily between the fruit and the taut ageworthy character. Screwcap.
This may be a nonvintage wine, but it's obvious from the yellow straw color that the wine is very ready to drink. The taste confirms this with a smooth palate with yellow fruit flavors and acidity that is well integrated. It's a delicious wine, fruity and generous at the end.
The aromas are redolent with notes of candy corn, peach and spice. The palate is full bodied and rich, with a layered creamy feel to the stone-fruit flavors. It shows some warmth on the finish.
Dusty notes of citrus fruits are mild but friendly. This Cava is zesty, fresh and simple as a whole, with lime, clover and grassy flavors. Freshness is the overriding theme, while the finish tastes of apple and lime.
Il Nonno is a very small-production blend of Sangiovese (59%), Cabernet Sauvignon (26%), Cabernet Franc (10%) and Petite Sirah (5%). It is remarkably black in color and a touch dull on the nose, made to be super Tuscan in style with blackberry and mushroom that perhaps went into hiding. The wine's bitter finish isn't great.
An attractively perfumed wine that shows a fine balance between fresh acidity and soft, sweet fruits. It is light in texture, open rather than concentrated. There is a rich black cherry final character.
Medium-bodied with a trace of vanilla-honey, this is a round, mouth filling white that that's viscous and rich on the palate, finishing in layers of tropical fruit.
Smooth, mellow and dry, this features savory flavors of blackberry jam, cola, licorice and baking spice. It's a sound red wine for drinking with everyday fare.
A powerful, spicy wine, luscious in its peppered berry fruits and sweet tannins. The structure is dramatic, offering a smooth texture as well as a drier core. With its weight, density and dark, final character, this is a wine for serious aging.
A succulent style that should have enormous appeal. Honey, pineapple and melon aromas and flavors show off Riesling's fruity side, but the wine's minerality keeps it from seeming overly simple.
This is a great effort by winemaker Etienne Terlinden, offering dense and deep but bright and lively blackberry, black cherry, cola, graphite and a touch of wild herbs on the nose. Long-lasting flavors of sarsaparilla, shaved licorice, vanilla bean, bay leaf, fennel seed and dark earth meet with more black cherry fruit on the palate, carried by an expert acidity level.
An easy, fun rosé, with apricot, peach, orange and melon flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. The finish is nice and dry.
Winemaker Hank Beckmeyer presses Syrah and Mourvèdre to make this rosé, hoping that in the process he'll best preserve the wine's aromas and also keep it tasting fresh. He's created a nutty wine that's dominant in strawberry and stone fruit flavors. It's very light and dry, leaving you with the impression of having just bitten into a piece of watermelon.
While this may not be the strongest Clos de Sixte the Jaume family has made, it's still a very good effort. The red fruit aromas and flavors seem slightly confectionary, but carry enough pie-cherry flavors to see them through, backed by hints of dark chocolate. The tannins are supple, turning to a cocoa-powder texture on the crisp finish. Drink now–2018.
This individualistic Chardonnay has a lot to offer. The nose is ripe, with floral, honey and even petrol notes and opens to a palate of tangerine and lychee nut-like flavors.  The mouthfeel is round and smooth; the sweet and sour finish, dry and spicy. Reminiscent of some Alsatian whites and worthy of notice for its flavorful uniqueness.
87-89. Barrel sample. Caramel aromas from new wood dominate this wine. It's all burnt, toasty wood and dense tannins.
This Barbaresco offers remarkable aromatic intensity and complexity that takes the form of white chocolate, small red berries, cola, road tar and red licorice. Based on the boldness of the nose, you'd expect the mouthfeel to be pulpy and fat. Instead, it is elegantly linear and tightly packed.
The Pomatia blend in 2009 is 45% Syrah, 35% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Merlot and 10% Cab Franc. The emphasis on Syrah brings a defining sweetness along with compact berry flavors that carry a hint of green olive. As always, this is a palate-friendly, accessible and well-priced wine.
Gingery spice notes accent fresh pear and melon fruit in this medium- to full-bodied wine. It's round on the palate but not flabby, with a warm, spicy finish. Drink now.
A smooth and fruity wine that has soft tannins and a rich, juicy character. It is full of damson and black plum fruits, ripe and jammy at the end. Drink now.
This full-bodied wine is in the classic mode, offering very ripe and even overripe aromas. Voluptuous berry flavors verge on sweet, and the rich texture comes without a lot of drying tannin.
With brisk acidity and upfront fruit, this is ready to drink. The pineapple, pear and oak flavors are housed in a creamy mouthfeel.
Crisp and racy, this offers scents of Meyer lemon, orange peel and a whiff of peach. The linear, vibrant palate shows grapefruit, green apple and chopped herb accompanied by racy acidity and a hint of flint.
Rich black fruits are supported by a dark structure and intensely juicy, youthful acidity. It is powerful, ripe and full of potential. Definitely young with its exuberant fruit, it is going to need serious aging. Drink this wine from 2020.
Costera is a Cannonau-based wine (with some Carignano and Bovale) that sees a very light passing in wood. The result is a fruit-driven wine with a pinch of exotic spice and soft tannins. The real protagonist here, however, are the jammy, ripe berry notes.
Aromas of cream, baked croissant, lemon custard and dried apricot characterize the nose of this offering from the winery's estate vineyard just below the Santa Lucia Highlands. The palate packs lemon-buttered toast, roasted almonds, seared green apples and a cement element into a strong bottling.
Dry on the nose, with balsam shavings, pepper and secondary red fruit aromas. The palate has a choppy, fairly hollow feel and then short flavors of plum and berry. Spice and mint notes work the finish, which is mellow. Overall this is standardfare RDD.
Firm and dense, this wine has solid tannins as well as the potential of ripe black fruits. It has been firmly extracted, although the fruit is there to give the balance. Drink from 2018.
Sharp in acids and a little green, this dry red wine tastes like an old-fashioned Chianti. The flavors are of red cherries, herbs and pepper. Made from 70% Sangiovese and Cabernet Franc.
This Tempranillo-based pinkie is quite inviting and tightly textured, with aromas of orange shave ice, strawberry cream, watermelon and cement. It is extremely zesty and lively once sipped, offering easy-to-drink raspberry and melon notes. It's great for all sorts of food, from spicy to rich.
Has the color, weight and silky texture of Pinot Noir, with a nice acidity for balance. Unfortunately, the flavors are not as good. There's a vegetal aspect to the raspberries and cherries that lowers the score.
Raisiny and somewhat overripe, with cola and prune-like aromas. It feels wide and tannic, with grapy, herbal flavors of prune and molasses. The finish is thick, warm and syrupy.
An attractive, ripe wine that pushes up against raisiny but then draws back to focus on blackberry, licorice and other dark aromas and flavors. Very good weight and mouthfeel, with nice balance supporting ripe berry, cola and mild chocolate flavors. Finishes lush and warm. Drink now through 2011.
A prickling sensation provides a lively mouthfeel to this easy-drinking Chard, with light flavors of apple flesh and sweet citrus. Drink now.
This easy Vernaccia exhibits a very pale color and measured aromas of almond skin, pear, melon and white flowers. It is lean and watery in the mouth with a pinch of grapefruit-like acidity.
This is 100% Malbec, so inky it is black in color. The flavors echo the color, with amazing density. Black fruits, black olives, smoke and spice are structured around thick tannins. A minute-plus finish adds licorice and mint; even after being opened for a full 48 hours this wine remained fresh and balanced. It's the first varietal Malbec ever from Walla Walla Vintners, but certainly one hopes it is not the last.
Despite being a relatively recent vintage, this wine shows mature, mushroomy aromas and its flavors possess slightly meaty overtones, somewhat similar to beef stock. Those complex, savory notes are a definite plus, and should make this otherwise light-bodied sparkler versatile at the table. Drink now.
Bone-dry, tart in acids, and with rose petal, crushed raspberry, dried red currant, herb tea and pepper flavors, this rosé is zesty and versatile with food. It's a blend of Zinfandel, Syrah, Pinot Noir and Cabernet Sauvignon.
Tasted alongside other South Australian Cabs, this one is distinguished by its restraint and elegance. The nose has a nice briary quality; the palate has well-integrated tannins, and flavors of red fruit and eucalyptus. Medium in body, and very juicy through the long finish.  Drink now–2013.
The oak shows itself first on this wine with aromas of vanilla and coconut in front of sappy fruit. The flavors are full bodied, equal parts fruit and barrel, with vanilla taking the lead on the finish. There are good things but the oak dominates.
Rich and creamy in pineapple, orange and lime fruit, with a sweet coating of new oak, this Chardonnay is balanced with zesty acidity. It's an opulent, flashy wine.
This very dry Syrah has soft tannins and a full-bodied mouthfeel, with complicated flavors of baked cherries, cola, bacon and sandalwood. It's quite a good wine, but astringent now, making for a puckery feeling. Doesn't seem like an ager, so drink with rich fare.
Classic northern Rhône aromas of smoke, espresso and black olive set the stage, followed by layers of dark fruit and spice. The finish is softly dusty, brimming with plum and licorice notes. Full-bodied, concentrated and supple, this is ready to drink now, yet should age well through 2025 or so.
The producer suggests serving this delicately perfumed Sauvignon with cheese and sliced ham, and that's not a bad idea. The wine is crisp and firm and has the natural acidity to keep your palate refreshed.
This Riesling is smooth in the mouth, with yellow-fruit flavors and aromas—banana is particularly prevalent—and a fine dusting of chalk. Opens and closes with nice citrus accents.
Barrel aromas of vanilla and baking spice are at the fore, with cranberry lurking in the background. The dried fruit flavors drink off dry, with cranberry flavors on the finish.
Foxy, floral berry and plum aromas include notes of green herbs. A palate with big, rubbery tannins and herbal flavors of spiced berry fruits and cinnamon finishes with abrasive, drying tannins. This blend holds Garnacha Tintorera, Bobal and Tempranillo.
Slightly funky aromas of dried, composting red and purple roses meet with crushed mint, vanilla and red berries on the nose of this complex bottling. Pomegranate, red plum and strawberry fruit show on the palate, bolstered by wet gravel, thyme and black-pepper spice.
86—88 Barrel sample. Light, fresh and crisp, this wine is on the fresher side of the Sauternes flavor scale. It is very poised, elegant, but doesn't have the power.
This wine is 47% each Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, with the balance Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Aromas of dill, dried herb, cocoa and spice are followed by soft elegantly styled dark-fruit flavors that show plenty of hang time.
Vibrant and concentrated, this light-bodied wine is one of the best of the flamboyantly packaged La Catrina line so far. Packed with vivid fruit flavor, it's lightly sweet but nicely balanced by fresh acidity and flavors like citrus and apple.
Aromas of red berry marinated in spirits, sun baked earth, game and a hint of cured meat come together on this. The tightly wound palate offers raw red berry, grilled sage, mint, clove and anise alongside bracing tannins. Give it a few more years for the tannins to unwind, then drink sooner rather later.
This is a distinctive blend of Roussanne and Viognier. It's impressively rich, offering up complex waves of kiwi, vanilla custard, white peach sorbet and white chocolate flavors. That makes it sound sweet, but it's a dry wine. A little soft, but totally delicious.
With a pink color so deep that it borders on mauve, the exotic notes play a leading role, with passionfruit, papaya, and guava hitting the nose first. On the palate, it's full and flavorful, reminiscent of a Mexican agua fresca made from strawberries and watermelon. This is beach wine at its finest.
Here's one of those edgy, sassy Italian whites that pairs so magically with pasta or simple seafood. A crisp, lean texture aids in its ability to wash the palate clean but the wine also has just enough creaminess and staying power not to be overwhelmed by the food served with it.
This rosé is a field blend of Mourvèdre and Grenache. A very pretty pale-peach color, the aromas bring pleasing notes of herb, spice, strawberry, passion fruit and mineral. The flavors are dry and full in feel, showing weight and intensity but still a sense of lightness.
Touched by minerality and light in style, this Chardonnay from new producer Hannah Nicole is sippable with tart pear and apple and very high tones of lemon zest, its acidity high.
Soft, simple and on the sweet side, with candied flavors of cherries, raspberries and chocolate. Drink this everyday wine with easy fare.
Fragrantly viscous and deeply golden in color, this has coatings of honey and apricot amid its full body and texture.
A great success for this bottling. With extraordinarily high residual sugar, the wine is very sweet in wild honey, infused with the essence of oranges and apricots, folded into rich, buttery custard, and sprinkled with vanilla sugar and cinnamon. It's all balanced with a squirt of lime acid. If that sounds good, it is. Only 95 cases were produced, but finding this wine is worth a search.
Aged for eight years in oak cask, this is a magical, meditative wine from the grandfather of Valpolicella tradition. The wine opens with a bright ruby hue with lively aromas of apple skin, white cherry, cranberry and delicate shadings of soft spice, smoke and licorice.
Powerful black cherry and blackberry aromas and flavors seem to infuse this full-bodied wine with lots of fruit energy. It tastes vivid and unique because of that deep vein of black fruit impressions, and stays balanced by firm acidity and fine-grained tannins in spite of its alcoholic strength.
This cheeky blend of Chardonnay and Bordeaux-inspired Sauvignon Blanc is delicately framed. Fresh and fruity, it discloses apple and lemon notes accented with hints of smoke and savory nuts.
As its name suggests, this vineyard is above the Marconnets, one of Beaune's top vineyards. Beautifully perfumed, it is ripe with orange zest, apples and a streak of delicious citrus acidity. It has a light touch, fruity, with hints of wood and minerality.
The aromas of apricot, honeysuckle and jasmine are light and elegant. The flavors show restraint but the concentration doesn't all seem there.
Barrel aromas of vanilla and graphite take the lead. The red-fruit flavors are ripe and jammy. There are plenty of good things going on but they don't quite all come together.
Red plum and cherry aromas accompany a hint of lemony oak. The palate feels fresh, suggesting tomato, with ample body.

Give this tough, young Cabernet a good long decant before serving. At first, it's dominated by sharp acidity and mouth-numbing tannins. But after some airing, it offers black currant flavors. This is likely not an ager.
This has brisk acidity, finely ground tannins and an intense minerality that gives it a nervy core.

White-fruit aromas, brine and clam shell notes get this Albariño going. The mouthfeel is full and lemony. Flavors of pickled, briny citrus and nectarine carry onto the finish. This is at its best now; in 2014 it will not be so good.
Ripe and jammy, this Cab comes from a vineyard east of St. Helena on the lower slopes of Howell Mountain. The wine is extremely ripe and jammy, with pronounced blackberry, cherry, black raspberry and currant flavors. A little aggressive in fruity sharpness now, it should calm down over the next several years.

A rare Petit Verdot from Washington, very dark and smoky, with earth, herb, a smooth palate, and ripe tannins. This is more terroir-driven than varietally “correct” – a bit of green tea flavor comes in with the tannins, but overall everything is nicely managed.
The overriding sentiment is that Limarí is too cool for Carmenère, yet this wine, while a bit sour and rhubarby, is still pretty comfy and satisfying.

Minty, chocolaty and oaky on the first, second and third takes. The palate is full and rich, with toasty, resiny flavors supporting big berry fruit notes and chocolate. Finishes dry and with another wave of toasty wood character. Overly woody but also ripe and healthy.

Shows cherry, cola, tangerine zest and spicy flavors. Good through 2010 or so.
This is an hommage to the owning family's white Rhône wine from France. It's a crisp, minerally wine, firm and clean and dry, with flavors of dried citrus fruits, orange peel, honeysuckle flower, vanilla and toast. Shows real elegance and sophistication.
You can feel the wood, rather than tasting it, such is the delicious fruit character: layers of ripe white fruits, shot through with citrus, white figs and crisp nectarine. The wine is edging towards youthful austerity but the fruit gives it great life and freshness. Imported by Robert Kacher Imports.
92-94 With huge tannins, very dark fruits, powerful and concentrated. The wine is ripe, juicy and firmly tannic.
A bit murky and damp on the nose, with brandied fruit and raisin aromas. The palate is solidly formed, with basic raspberry flavors but not much follow through as the finish shows buttery, soft flavors. Inoffensive but more generic than individual.
Father-son winemakers Joe and Sam Miller use fruit from the vineyard Dick Graff planted in 1989 for this interesting wine, which shows preserved lemons, dried apples, crushed ants, iodine and yogurt on the nose. There's lemon pith, smoked citrus, Japanese pear flesh and crisp plum flavors on the palate.
This is a northern Rhône-style blend, with a touch of Viognier in the Syrah that softens the considerable dark, tannic power of the wine. Along with this solid structure, the wine also has ripe black-plum-skin and blackberry flavors. A concentrated wine, it still needs to age. Drink from 2018.
Too heavy for a rosé, with black cherry, cola and leather flavors that lack the delicacy and zest you want in a blush wine.
From a warm vineyard, it has super-ripe aromas of baked cherry pie, with smoky vanilla. Made in a rustic style, with berry flavors and soft acidity.
Like so many Drouhin wines, this is beautifully balanced. The wood, green fruit, spice and acidity already in fine harmony. There is a richness coming from the deep soils of the vineyard. Can it age? Probably, because of the firm structure.

A bit sharp and volatile at first, but with time the aromas mellow out to rest on black fruits and olive. The palate has a lively kick to it but it's also sort of hard and heavy, with roasted, basic black fruit and herbal flavors. Caramelized on the finish, but aggressive as a whole.
Good red wine in a light, herbaceous style. Tastes fresh and clean as if it was made with good quality standards. Lacks much Cabernet character, however, but adds sufficient cherry and berry flavors to make it complete.
Don't look to this expensive Pinot as a prime example of Santa Rita Hills. It's too soft and simple in oak-influenced raspberry and cherry jam.

Has a compelling and complex nose offering pepper, cinnamon, and black cherry, with earthy accents. A medium-weight wine, it shows good balance and sweet-and-sour flavors. The buttered black-toast/popcorn element rides a bit heavy on the cherry fruit. Herzog is on the right track; a few years ago a wine of this quality bearing the Kosher label was inconceivable.
This red offers bright berry and violet in its pretty, perfumed nose, followed by soft, integrated cherry and pepper flavors. The wine has an impressive complexity and a spicy, lingering finish. Pair with cheeses, duck, turkey.

Attractive, crisp, raspberry-flavored wine with a touch of structure and vivid acidity. This is a great food rosé, for salads or fish.
A mix of fruit that survived the big freeze, from Dwelley, Morrison Lane and Minnick vineyards. It's tight, tart and tannic, and showing some pickle barrel notes from time in new American oak. Herbal and compact, this is a wine that should probably be given another year or so in the bottle to smooth itself out.
Savory black pepper and cooked blueberry show on the nose of this bottling. Cracked pepper also gives a savory touch to the sip, adding depth to the blackberry and plum flavors. The tannins are fairly sticky into the finish.
Near equal parts Merlot and Cabernet Franc with the balance Cabernet Sauvignon (14%), this wine is aromatically reserved, with notes of tire rubber, parsley, coffee and exotic spices. It's supple in feel, filled with coffee and cherry flavors. There's plenty interesting going on but the aromas and flavors seem disconnected.
Leathery berry aromas are balky and dusty. Hard, dry and tannic on the palate, this shows blackberry flavors followed by dry, bitter notes. A simmering finish says this badly needs food.
Underbrush, truffle, stewed plum and toasted aromas come together in the glass. The packed, densely concentrated palate offers raisin, blackberry jam, pipe tobacco, baking spice and dark bitter chocolate framed in bracing, close-grained tannins that still need to unwind. You'll also notice the warmth of alcohol on the finish. Give this a few more years to let the tannins loosen up. Drink 2018 through 2026.

Fresh and uncomplicated, which is the true DNA of basic Prosecco. It's a cocktail-apéritif wine par supreme, a bit sweet but not overwhelmingly so. The flavors of apple and pear are pure and likable. And the wine shows a touch of creaminess as it sits on your tongue. Imported by Marco & Son Wine Importing.
Aromas of orchard fruit, dried herb and toasted bread crust lead the nose. The creamy palate offers mature apple, white peach, nectarine and mineral alongside an elegant perlage that carries through to the bone-dry yet succulent finish.

The fruit is precise and fine-tuned, showing nuances of mixed green and yellow berries, citrus and stone fruits, along with a smooth vein of butterscotch from barrel aging in new French oak. A sophisticated debut that promises good things to come.
Fragrances are reminiscent of stone fruit, flint and dried hay. The subtle palate offers raw yellow peach, honeydew melon and tropical fruit alongside racy acidity.
Puts all the pieces of the puzzle together, combining ripe tropical fruit, ample sweet oak and coastal acidity, but the picture is a little blurry. The wine is decadently ripe and obvious.
Grenache takes the lead position in this dusty, salmon-colored rosé. It looks and tastes French, and has been given a bit more bottle age than most domestic rosés. Fruits run from wild strawberry and watermelon to light citrus, woven together and set against rather firm tannins. A substantial wine with real grip and depth.
Slightly disjointed at first, this Barolo with fruit sourced from four vineyard sites, needs a few minutes to open in the glass. The wine offers tertiary aromas of cured beef, smoked bacon and white mushroom. Drink now.
Lemongrass and Granny Smith apple aromas introduce chalk and floral flavors.  Zingy and tangy in the mouth, it closes long, with a little pineapple-lemon sweetness and minerals.
This 100% varietal wine opens in a heady aroma of leather pouch, clove and marshmallow. Both herbaceous and tannic, it begs for more time in the bottle or substantial swirling in the glass.
Whiffs of cedar and baking spices lead to ripe blackberry and boysenberry flavors in this well-balanced and easy to appreciate wine. The ample fruit flavors are hard to resist, and the supple, modestly tannic texture is just right.
Green citrus is aligned with green apple on the nose.

The body is light and the green apple and citrus notes, cushioned by lovely biscuit notes, last all the way to an echoing, dry finish.

This is one of the best Mourvèdres in recent memory. It has the silky texture of Pinot Noir, yet is full bodied in fruity tannins, and most importantly feels clean and vibrant throughout. Shows exciting flavors of cherries and raspberries, with a meaty note of grilled beef splashed with soy sauce. Lovely now with a great grilled steak.
A good tannic edge to this Gonfrier family wine gives it structure and places it in the food category. With plenty of acidity, it is also refreshing, textured at the end with a lift of zesty lemon.
The wine opens with a foamy, fun personality but does not ultimately provide that extreme vibrancy you usually get with Prosecco. This is a chewy, broad and opulent wine with mature fruit and a dusty quality.

A virtual fruit salad with bubbles, this wine gushes cherry, apple and banana aromas. It has equally ripe flavors and a broad, almost soft texture punctuated by lively effervescence.

What a delicious wine. It shows the mineral, almost steely character of 1996. Flavors of grapefruit and green apples are pure and intense; a touch of toast wraps it up. Will develop over many years.
Some early gas and sulfuric aromas blow off from the nose, leaving meaty berry scents.

Probably best from 2008 through 2012. Imported by Fine Wines from Spain.

Almost indistinguishable from a Premier Cru Beaune Burgundy, this Pinot, with alcohol of only 14.1%, is light in body, silky and dry. In the mouth, it shows a firm minerality, with cherry tart and spice flavors. A polished, subtle wine that should age well over the next ten years.

The Bessards vineyard is right at the heart of the Hermitage hill. Delas only makes this wine in top years (no 2002, for example), and the quality shows in the aromas of black fruits and violets, the flavors of huge, dense fruit and powerful tannins. This is serious wine, which promises at least 10 years of aging.

Embodies all the easy-drinking informality of the Italian wines we knew 20 or 30 years ago. It's clean and crisp and would pair with lasagna, pasta or fried eggplant.
Like most Garys' Pinots, this is an enormous wine in both fruit and alcohol. It detonates on the palate with mega-flavors of ripe cherries, raspberries and vanilla cola. Yet it maintains a pure, elegant Pinot Noir silkiness. However, there's a funky, sweaty smell that's a turn-off.
This full-bodied, tannic Cabernet features a simple delivery of ripe blackberries, cherries and sweet red currants. Pair it with everyday fare.

This isn't a prototypically silky or delicate Pinot Noir; instead, it offers a slightly chunky take on the grape, with notes of chocolate and plum and just a hint of tea. It's a satisfying, medium-bodied red with supple tannins.
Except for the sweetness, this is a pretty good wine. It has rich tannins, decent acidity, and ripe flavors of blackberry, cherry and raspberry jam. But that white sugary taste is off-putting in a table wine.

The oak is a little too strong on this Pinot. Impressive as the underlying wine is in concentrated raspberry and cherry flavors, the barrel influence is dominant, with sweet buttered toast and caramel. Drink it now, after a brief decanting.
Lovely as usual; from one of California's finest Pinot producers, here's a wine with tons of cherry and cola fruit cruising on a silky, velvety texture. There's a stewed, baked-fruit quality from the horrendous harvest heat, but it has been handled well.
Rich, but with a delicious aerial character, floating the white fruits over fresh acidity, green apple and peach flavors and a final delicate touch of mineral and spice. The wine is developing well, bringing forward its fine texture, delicate initially and then rounding in the mouth.
Erath's Juliard bottling has a bit more stiffness and muscle than the wide-open Hyland, but tails off too quickly to be considered as a cellar candidate. The soft strawberry fruit flavors are wrapped in pleasing chocolate, and lightly spicy, toasty details pop up throughout. It just lacks grips and length.
Only 20% new oak on this wine, but it sure does stand out, dominating the modest fruit with a smoky, charry taste. Hard to like this toothpicky Chard.
Clearly a step in quality above the winery's regular release. A slight cloudiness suggests an unfiltered wine -- whether or not this is true -- but it has the stuffing of flavor and texture that make it interesting.

Brooding aromas of lemon curd, fresh herb and citrus lead to broad citrus and herb flavors in this wine. It lacks concentration.
Earthy notes of pear mix with the generous sweetness of a late harvest wine. The palate is concentrated and lushly sweet, but full of rich flavors, tinged with pear and orange, caramel and lemon oil, acacia honey and candied lemon peel. Lovely, bright and still totally fresh. Drink 2016–2030.

Russian River-based MacMurray Ranch turns to the Central Coast's Santa Lucia Highlands for Pinot Noir, with admirable results.

Might develop for a few years, but best now for youthful exuberance, although you do want to give it three hours in a decanter.
Floral aromas of violet and black fruits include an oak-driven scent of plastic. In the mouth, this PV is plump and widespread, maybe even a bit flabby. Flavors of salty, leafy, spicy berry and black cherry are dry, meaty and toasty on the finish, with subtle tannins. Drink through 2016.
This is leafy and red smelling at first, then becoming raw and candied tasting, with a herbal note.
If pink could have a taste, this is the wine. From hand-picked 100% Cabernet Franc, it is all about bright fruit and red berries. Soft with touches of caramel, it delivers good acidity at the end.

Creamy and full-bodied wine layered with lime and other citrus flavors that highlight acidity although the aftertaste is sweet.
There's a very fine wine lurking inside this bottle, but right now, everything's disjointed. There are big tannins over here, oak over there, and sandwiched in between are huge, intense flavors of blackberry, blueberry and cassis liqueur. It's nowhere near ready, but there's no reason why this dramatic young wine shouldn't come together and improve over the years. Cellar it until 2017 and check up on it; this could be really something in 2025.
Tight and a bit hot, this single-vineyard bottling from Masi shows sour-cherry, cranberry, chocolate and mint flavors along with some chalky mineral notes. It's quite youthful and restrained, with firm, even biting, tannins. It's nicely extracted and should show more in three to four years.
A nicely balanced Chard with typical attributes of lemon rind, crisp red apple, butter and toasted nuts. Aged in French oak and sur lie for nine months, the mouth is quite full and developed with flavors of baked apple and brioche. An excellent choice for chicken; drink now.

The Côte des Bar is the source of grapes for this Aube-based producer, now in the family's eighth generation. This dry rosé gets its richness from ripe red Pinot Noir cut with refreshing citrus acidity from the Chardonnay and Pinot Blanc. The Pinot Noir also adds texture. Drink now.

Here's a dry, elegant Grenache for drinking now. It has a silky texture, with slightly rough tannins and flavors of cherry pie, anise, mocha, pepper and herbs.
A remarkable value, Oxford Landing's GSM is a convincing argument in favor of blending. It offers a complex mélange of leather, spice and cherry notes, medium body and a fresh, vivacious finish. Considering it can probably be found for around $80 per case, this would make a great everyday wine for drinking over the next year or so.
Berry and plum aromas smell a bit burnt, sort of like a burning field. A healthy lively medium-bodied palate delivers smoky oaky roasted berry and plum flavors in front of a lightly spiced finish.
Aged in neutral French oak, it has light notes of herbs, plum, pencil lead and crushed flowers. The acids are tart and racy competing with somewhat gruff tannins. Pair it with pizza or pasta with a red sauce to see it at its best.
This 100% varietal wine offers aromas of barrel spices, mint, dried fruit and barnyard. It's full bodied but still shows good deftness.
Exotic yet classic aromas and generous, complex flavors make this medium-bodied wine very compelling. Black-tea leaves, black cherry, clove and mint are a few of the nuances that flood the palate, and the lush viscosity allows them to linger on the finish.
Reduced, stewy, lightly herbal aromas blend berry and tomato scents. The acidity on this five-grape blend is pointed and overriding. Flavors of herbal berry and currant are tangy but also stewy, while the finish is long and green in flavor.

Dense chalk soil gives this wine its intense minerality and acidity. It is one of a series of Champagnes from three major Chardonnay villages in the Côte des Blancs. With its floral character, white fruit and citrus flavors and still-young acidity, it is a Champagne to age. Drink this bottling, disgorged in 2016, from 2019.
A saline edge offsets crisp yellow peach and starfruit flavors in this zesty dry Riesling. It's spry and fruity, yet elegant, finishing with surprising persistence.
Seductive and forward, the Avec Chêne (with wood) boasts intense aromas of vanilla, butter and cream that frame the superripe peach and guava fruits.

A warm, sunny blend of local grapes, this is ripe while still having a fresh, fruity character. The acidity at the end reinforces this contrast between richness and crispness. Drink now.

Very ripe, rich and fruity, showing powerful blackberry, cassis and cedar flavors. The structure is classic Napa, with firm, dynamic tannins and a fine application of acidity. Feels just great in the mouth, if on the young side. Give this wine three or four years in the cellar.
Oak, sweet vanilla, chocolate and plum cake aromas take center stage. The aromas carry on to the palate but there's not enough fruit to stand up to the oak or the astringent wood-driven tannins that leave the mouth feeling dried out.
Big and opulent, this has ripe tropical fruits, with a soft, toasty texture and full-bodied feel. With its richness, this is developing quickly and is already ready to drink.
This wine has a caramel edge that gives richness but also detracts from the fruit. It offers a smooth texture along with a spicy edge. Drink now.
Scoring slightly higher than the Alderpoint vineyard-designated wine, this basic Humboldt County bottling bursts with with black cherry aroma.

Lively acidity and mouth-filling texture keep the cherry and raspberry notes echoing through the finish, striking wonderful balance in an appetizing, mouthwatering package.
Aromas of dark plum, sun-baked soil, cooking spice and grilled herb flow together in the glass. Made entirely with Sangiovese, the palate shows breeding and class, offering ripe black cherry, ground pepper, tobacco and aniseed alongside youthfully austere tannins. Give this time to fully develop. Drink 2017–2027.
While obviously not a “cult” wine, this full-bodied bottling has just what the varietal should offer in terms of ripe fruit, spice, a firm and moderately tannic texture, and a mouthfilling presence. Its strengths lie in good balance, tempting layers of flavor and a lingering finish.
Effervescent in honeysuckle and papaya, this vineyard-designated white offers medium body and a long length. It becomes a rounded expression of melon and minerality on the palate that's both fresh and fruity.
This young wine offers fresh raspberry and pomegranate scents on the lively, simple nose, with dashes of anise and wet slate. Those bright red fruit flavors show on the palate, too, seasoned with thyme and bay leaf and finishing clean.
Cabernet Franc has been the signature wine for Barrister since the first release in 2001. Once again it comes out dark and smoky in the house style, but with more spine and muscle than the Barrister Merlot. It's fully ripe and not at all vegetal, though you will find that it has the characteristic Cab Franc streak of pepper and coffee behind ripe black cherry and cassis fruit.
Aromas of white wild flower and golden apple waft out of the glass while the juicy palate offers Bartlett pear and a hint of nectarine. Fresh acidity gives it a tangy finish.
Made of 60% Malvasia, 30% Trebbiano and 10% Sangiovese, this opens with apricot and orange jam aromas. The warm, structured palate delivers toasted almond, chestnut honey and dried fig flavors. Drink through 2025.
There’s some really fine Cabernet character in this affordable wine, which contains 10% Merlot. It’s got black-currant and plum fruit, finely etched and pure, with a light touch of oak, and there’s some real substance and depth of flavor. You’ll be surprised at the classiness at this price. It’s a mystery how this winery achieves wines this good when they could be selling them for much more. Best Buy.
The blend includes Cabernet Sauvignon, Shiraz, Malbec and Merlot, but what takes center stage is cedar and vanilla. The bead is slightly coarse, but it helps to balance out the oak.
Rich aromas of black cherry, anise seeds and buttered violets greet the nose on this dense bottling of a grape that rarely gets solo treatment. The palate is tarry and grippy, with dried sour cherries, boysenberry, black pepper and tightly grained cedar flavors that approach pine sap.
Hints of sultana and cooked quince reach the nose suggesting richness. The palate, however, responds with streamlined freshness, ripe fruit and depth and gives us concentration rather than richness. Tangy citrus zest frames notions of ripe apple and quince while shadows of dried fruit still haunt aromatically. The finish is clean, totally satisfying and dry. This is soaring but hearty stuff.
This was the final vintage Patrick Campbell fully presided over before selling the winery. It's a dense and compact wine, showing mountain tannins framing black currant, cassis, mineral, violet and new oak flavors. Despite the opulence, the finish is dry. Made from 100% Cabernet, the wine needs time in the cellar. Try it after 2018, and it should be rolling along in the mid-2020s.
A wine that is highly extracted, the tannins with a hard edge. It is not helped by excessive wood. The ensemble is aggressive and rather tough.
This Extra Brut sparkler offers drying mineral tones backed by passion fruit, kiwi, pear and Golden Delicious apple. The aromas are delicate and so are the flavors, although they do linger long on the palate. The wine is cheerful and bright throughout.
Aromas of smoked cherry, plum, tomato and apple skin fit the bill for the region. The fresh palate shows weight, with plum, currant and dry spice flavors. On the finish, this wine takes on a loamy weight and a modest raisin note.
A dry, austere Riesling, with what one hopes will be considerable cellaring potential, Dry River's 2009 Craighall displays apple and lime accents and a long, citrus-rind, almost lip-puckering finish.
Fumé Blanc is just another name for Sauvignon Blanc, and this is a delicious one. Dry and racy in acidity, it has deep citrus, tropical fruit and gooseberry flavors. At this price, it's one of the best Sauvignon Blancs on the market. Relatively easy to find, with more than 30,000 cases produced.
This full-bodied red opens with aromas of mature plum, hay, underbrush and scorched earth. The ripe, juicy palate doles out layers of black cherry, strawberry, tobacco and cinnamon alongside chewy tannins. It's already enjoyable but will also age well for several years. Enjoy through 2019.
A pure expression of Syrah from coastal Tuscany, this plush wine opens with cherry, tobacco and cigar-like aromas. It's fine, elegant and streamlined on the finish thanks to a touch of crispness.
A whiff of fresh brioche against a backdrop of sunny grapefruit and plum flavors makes this forward fruity off-dry Riesling especially inviting. While lively and crisp, its juicy, quaffable style makes it an easy pleaser. Drink now.
Roundly fruity—almost candied—with the sweet, fruitcake spices competing with a leathery, barnyard note. Turns slightly bitter and roasted in the finish. Strong flavors, but not for everyone.
Doug Margerum delivers his annual crowd-pleaser with this bottling, which evokes ripe apple, sweet stone fruit and grapefruit pith on the nose. Chalky texture and racy acidity mark the palate, providing the perfect framework for sour kumquat flavors and a cement-like minerality.
From a 20-acre property in the heart of the Douro, family-owned since the 19th century, this is a concentrated wine, wearing its richness easily. It is powered as much by juicy fruit as by the fine play of fruit tannins or wood. Give this ageworthy wine 3–5 years.
It's nice that they've held back this wine for a few years before releasing it, because it's beginning to meld together in a very delightful way. The tannins, oak and alcohol are coalescing with the cherries, pomegranates, cola, tangerine, vanilla and spices, giving the wine a silky, complex, mellow mouthfeel. Beautifully dry and lush now, and should develop through 2012.
Still young, this wine brings out the ripe and creamy side of Alvarinho. Its citrus character is prominent along with a strong mineral texture. Weight from the skin contact during fermentation has produced a dense structure. Keep this wine until 2015.
Inky in color with tar, rhubarb and green tomato scents that slide into a more earthy expression on the palate. A year or two in bottle will smooth the grippy tannins. Try with spare ribs.
Leafy underbrush, wet earth, cellar floor and dried rose petal are some of the aromas you'll find on this. The evolved palate is rather muddled, offering dried black cherry, game, vanilla and a green note of powdered sage accompanied by astringent tannins that leave a mouth drying finish.
This bombastically brawny Merlot is blended with Syrah and Malbec. The grapes have been sourced from some fine vineyards, including Hudson, Stagecoach and Antica, as well as the cooler Trefethen in Oak Knoll. Juicy blackberry veers into syrupy territory, a thickness that never lets up, accented in smoky oak and vanilla.
This is a warm and rich wine from the southern Mâcon region. It is ripe with yellow fruits, crisp apples and a touch of minerality that gives the tangy texture. Packed with fruit as well as structured, this wine can be drunk now, although better from 2017.
Surprisingly soft for a Cabernet, this is a rich, generous wine with very ripe black fruits and a minimum of tannins. It is dense and ready to drink.
Citrusy and grassy on the nose, picking up hints of boxwood on the way to a surprisingly plump yet neutral midpalate. Tangy on the finish. Imported by Guardian of the Grape Imports.
This vintage of Tezza's Corte Majoli Ripasso offers much more intensity on the nose that comes forward as smoky-spice, leather, tobacco and mature berry. The wine is aged in oak and this process had imparted background tones of vanilla and toasted nut.
Few wineries in Argentina make more individual wines than Achaval-Ferrer. And while some are great, others leave you scratching your head or wanting something different. This one has a deep hue but a strange mix of herbal, floral aromas that hint at air freshener. The palate is quite acid-driven and downright sharp, with pounding blueberry and kirsch flavors. More austere and tangy than we prefer.
Take this wine's deep purple color as a warning of big things to come. A grapy nose with herbal and violet aromas precedes a heavily saturated palate with spice and prune flavors. A pounding, long, plum-driven finish confirms that this mostly about size.
A firm and lively Cab with aromas of tobacco, cassis, spice cake and chocolate. It's ripe and forward on the palate, where the bouquet is reflected via flavors of cassis, vanilla, coffee and tobacco. Fresh on the finish and never herbal despite the 15% Carmenère in the blend.

Produced from the oldest Pinot Noir vines in the Willamette Valley, this extraordinary wine is history in a bottle. Glorious aromatics offer intense scents of citrus, pine needle, pepper and berry, with flavors following. There's a welcome kick of citrus in the natural acidity, and this promises a long cellar life, as proven over and over again by this founding Oregon winery. Drink 2020 through 2040 and beyond.
Very friendly and clean cava with good fruit and a pinch of aromatic toast. It's far from out of the ordinary, but it is extremely fresh and clean, with pure lemon-lime and green apple on the palate. Finishes fruity and with finesse. Really good in an uncomplicated way.
This is a smooth, yellow fruit-flavored wine that comes from a small area of the appellation. It has ripe apricot fruit and a toasty, creamy texture, giving it rich, full flavor. A light touch of textured minerality lifts the wine on the finish.
The gentle mix of red apple and strawberry play aromatically around nose and palate. There is ample fruit and ample citrus freshness. The palate is light, dry but focused and very refreshing.
This revamped label by Josh Klapper of La Fenetre is exciting on all fronts, and this four-barrel bottling from Aubaine Vineyard is one of the best. Light red cherry and pomegranate meet with gravel, dried basil and oregano on the delicate nose. Thyme, bergamot and Earl Grey tea flavors pop on the tight palate, which is still wound up but offers underripe strawberry, fennel and lavender florality.
Picture perfect Sonoma Zin, said to be made from old-vine vineyards. It's dry, softly tannic and sweetly ripe in black raspberry, cherry and blackberry fruit, with a rich earthiness and even an umami touch of grilled bacon. Delicious for drinking now.
This smooth, medium-bodied red combines Cabernet Sauvignon with Carignane, Merlot, Malbec and Syrah to satisfying effect. The Merlot and Malbec hail from the Russian River Valley's renowned Dakine Vineyard. It's soft in red cherry and blackberry fruit, but a structured wine with depth from leather and spice notes.
Extracted and oaky, this will appeal to those who enjoy the popular style. It's strong in buttered toast and butterscotch flavors, with a pineapple jam note.
Pear and resin aromas are light. This wine's palate entry is really neat: you slide effortlessly into green-apple flavors and a nice, viscous texture, which clings through the dusty finish. Nice, unusual and hey, what a bargain.
The bouquet displays saucy, savory aromas that are both earthy and rubbery but also sort of suave and stylish. The surface of the main body shows a bit of tartness on top of cassis and black plum, while the finish is round, with full tannins clamping down. A burly red with plenty of kick.
Earthy, spicy plum and berry aromas are racy and a touch leathery. Grabby tannins make for a drawing mouthfeel, while this tastes of herbal plum and wild berry along with chocolate and mint. A dry, lightly oaked but spicy finish provides for a good ending.
It's toasty and lush with the scents and flavors of roasted walnuts and butterscotch; not a bad thing by any means. Under the sweet oak are flavors of berry, tart and fresh as if just-picked. This is a thoroughly delightful bottle and a rare find at this price—a Pinot Noir that can be enjoyed immediately but should cellar well for up to a decade.
87–89. Barrel sample. This is a fruity, lightweight wine that is very juicy and soft. It's attractively bright and fresh with an open character.
This onion-skin-pink wine is fruity, crisp and well balanced. Red-berry aromas follow through to the palate, joined by touches of roasted almonds as well as crisp, tight acidity. Still very fruity, the wine is ready to drink.
Dark in color, with spice and some concentration. The wine, though, is spoiled by volatility and a huge and unbalancing acidity. Nor is the spirit really integrated.
The wine comes from a tiny seven-acre estate to the east of the town of Saint-Emilion. Owned by the same family since 1847, it estate is making serious wine. This is a rich wine, perfumed by Cabernet Franc although firmly based in Merlot. Black plum and berries are strengthened by the firm tannins that will allow further aging. Drink from 2018.
92-94 Barrel sample. It may seem surprisingly light to begin with. But this wine has depth, richness, hinting at wood straining through the sweet fruit. It is firm, fresh, but properly tannic.
The wine opens with thick, purple concentration and segues to earthy aromas of asphalt, tar and mineral backed by dark fruit, prune and berry. It's a strange wine with too much emphasis on those heavy resin and tar notes but it would pair well with Mexican chocolate mole sauce.
This wine has rich Meyer lemon, lime, fig, date, green apple and spice flavors that are brightened by crisp acidity. But the sugary finish is too sweet.
While the nose is a delicate bouquet of cherry blossoms and raspberries, the palate of this pomegranate-toned wine is kicky and bright. Despite its extended bottle age, it's surprisingly primary still, bristling with tart sour-cherry flavor.
This very structured wine is dry, in the Laurent-Perrier house style. Crunchy green apples are supported by richness and a complex texture. With nine years in the cellar, it has already gained some maturity, but needs aging.
Blended with 6% Marsanne, the aromas are light (considering the appellation and producer), bringing notes of herb, smoked meat, white pepper, mineral and earth. The flavors are tart and bright, creating a real sense of freshness and vibrancy.
Jasmine and lychee form the basis of this wine's bouquet, with fresh-cut peach making for a delicious experience on the palate. Rich, dense and lengthy, it comes from a cool vineyard site that provides lots of natural minerality and a taste of wet stone.

Full, fleshy and ripe, this quite flavorful and fruit-powered Merlot comes from some of the best vines in the valley. In the blend is 12% Cab Sauvignon and 6% Cab Franc, aged 18 months in 60% new oak. It is the fruit that shines through, set against smooth tannins and just a hint of earth.
This is classic juice, hard and packed with power, showing dark fruits laced with mocha and spice. The chalky tannins are the only quibble, but this wine will improve for at least a decade in your cellar. —P.G.
Wood aging has given this a spicy feel. It's rich, full bodied and textured with a citrus tang. The texture is creamy, with pear and grapefruit notes. Age for another two years.
Awesomely good. Hard to exaggerate how exceptional it feels. Dry and silky, its basic architecture is acids and tannins. Within that framework are amazingly complex flavors of wild forest red berries and red currants, cola, licorice and exotic sandalwood. The 2008 vintage was kind to Talley Rosemary's. Drink now–2015.
What sets this wine apart are the cooling aromas of chopped mint and white licorice. It delivers tangy layers of black olive, resin, tar, tobacco leaf and sweet cinnamon stick.
This blend of 60% Grenache Blanc and 40% Viognier is quite lively. Chalk, lemon-lime, cider apples and yeast show strongly on the nose. A sourdough-bread element also pops on the palate, giving intrigue to the red apple, yellow pear and ambrosia-melon flavors.
The long slope of the Côte du Py has produced this structured wine that's firm, dry, tannic and needing to age. It is concentrated in both structure and in rich black-plum fruits. The wine will age well, so don't drink before 2017.
This Inzolia offers clean and fresh aromas of citrus, peach, white flower and garden herb. A subtle touch of sweetness is found on the palate.

Ripe fruit suggests a wine that is soft, juicy and unlikely to age for long. It has red berry flavors, attractive tannins and fine finishing acidity.

This leads with forest floor, blue flower and black-skinned berry aromas while the structured, savory palate offers black cherry, red plum and Asian spice hints. Supple tannins and vibrant acidity provide easygoing support and freshness. Enjoy through 2021.
There's lots of ripe, savory lemon, lime and pineapple fruit in this Sauvignon Blanc, which is brightened by crisp acidity. It's clean and mouthwatering, but it seems a little too sweet on the finish, which gives it a soda-like taste.
Lemony and zingy are buzzwords for this bouquet—expect the same citrusy tang on the palate as well. Mouthfeel, given the high acidity and citrusy notes, is best described as clean. Finish is medium-length, with apple and oak flavors, and acid that gives the back end another dash of unwelcome tartness.
This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon is pushing 15% alcohol, but does not descend into Pruneville; the fruit is super ripe, slightly sweet, open and luscious, with slightly candied flavors. Cherry pie and chocolate-covered strawberries come to mind, but the acids support both fruit and barrel and keep the wine lively and inviting.
The wine is structured and tannic which gives a dry edge that balances the perfumed black fruits and acidity. The aftertaste is fruity and juicy. Ready to drink.

Heavy and soft, with firm tannins. You'll find modest currant fruit, with a harsh, raisiny finish.
By no means a special wine but it does deliver full-force if generic dark-fruit aromas and flavors. The nose is a little hard and rubbery, but that's Utiel-Requena for you. Medium-bodied but not harsh or burnt; prune and blackberry flavors linger. Tempranillo and Syrah. Wines Imported by USA Wines Inc.
This private selection is nicely structured, pitting clean raspberry fruit against tight tannins. Those strong components are accented with touches of cola and earth and a subtle undercurrent of barrel toast.

This is a Merlot-dominant blend, with 30% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% Cabernet Franc blended in. It offers cooler-climate elements of dried herb, cedar and currant, with the tannins sleek and polished. The finish flirts with a taste of coconut. Drink now through 2021.
Leather, menthol, dark-skinned berry and light toast aromas slowly come together on this fresh, polished wine. The lithe, straightforward palate offers wild cherry, anise, orange peel and a hint of coffee while fine-grained tannins and vibrant acidity provide the framework.
The nose smells washed out, with hazy notes of char and cassis that come with a touch of sulfur. Light to medium bodied, the palate feels slick, soft and sweet tasting, with a candied cherry note that appears on the finish.
Shows a purity of texture, with a velvety-soft mouthfeel yet firmed with undertones of chalky minerals. Flavor-wise, it's all black and red sour cherry candy, Asian spices and smoky sandalwood. Not ready yet. Better mid-2010 and beyond.
A solid effort in a cool-climate Pinot, showing mixed berry, coffee and cola flavors and a spicy overlay of oak. Full-bodied and dry, with a cherry-fruit finish.
Lean and wiry in style, this pale Pinot Noir stands out as being different from most Marlborough bottlings. Modest strawberry and cranberry flavors are accented by leather and dark chocolate notes.
Herb and mint aromas dance with lactic berry notes, and as it unfolds a mask of sawdust and forced oak rises up to smother things. The palate is woody, tart and lemony, with an angular feel and a resiny finish. Harmony is in short supply here.
Aromas of black plum, black berries, underbrush and hints of espresso and chocolate all carry over to the palate. It's friendly but evolved, and you'll notice the warmth of alcohol although the official level is moderate.
Rare in Oregon (or anywhere this side of the Atlantic), this Graciano pushes a mix of pomegranate, cranberry and raspberry fruit front and center. It dips in the midpalate, then re-gathers with a mix of tea, coffee grounds and dark chocolate wrapping up the finish. Put this ringer into your next tasting of Spanish wines and you'll stump everyone.
Despite its moderate alcohol, this dry, full-bodied Pinot Gris feels quite plush and plump. Ripe white peach and apricot flavors are honeyed in tone, off set by fresh acidity and a slightly steely finish.
Good price for a Cabernet this rich and fruity. It's dry, tannic and full-bodied, with blackberry, black currant, dark chocolate and oak flavors made for drinking now.
Almost indistinguishable from a Pinot Noir, this polished wine is light and silky and dry, with brisk acidity highlighting red cherry, red licorice, cola and mushroom flavors. Drink this fancy wine now.
Underbrush, grilled porcini, roasted herb and menthol emerge in the glass. The medium-bodied, structured palate is initially closed but eventually reveals dark berry, white pepper, sage and orange zest alongside clenched tannins. It closes on a licorice note.
This stunning wine opens with classic Nebbiolo aromas of underbrush, new leather, blue flower and dark berry along with a whiff of menthol. The radiant savory palate delivers juicy Marasca cherry, crushed raspberry, clove and star anise framed in noble tannins and bright acidity. It's tempting now but will continue to unwind and develop complexity for years to come. Drink 2023–2043.
A bit drier in style than Fitz-Ritter's Durkheimer Riesling kabinett, this wine shows hints of peach and dried spices on the nose, then eases into similar flavors tinged with briny minerality on the long finish. It's plump enough to be enjoyable on its own, or with fish or poultry.
This is a luminous Prosecco Extra Dry that opens with a delicate straw color and perky, persistent perlage. It offers aromas of stone fruit, peach, fresh apricot and honey and it has sweet fruit flavors followed by lively effervescence.
Earthy baked cherry and a strong streak of cardamom make for an impressive entry to this wine, flavors that persist on the palate. Beautifully rich without being ridiculous, it finds balance in complex, layered textures and nuanced characteristics, with a length of rose petals on the finish.
Ripe and solid, this has dense tannins and a superstructure of opulent red-berry and black currant fruits. The wine is layered with coffee, wood-aging influence and a firm finish. It's big and has great potential.
Fresh and savory, this vibrant red offers classic Sangiovese sensations of violet, red berry, black cherry, tilled soil and dark spice. It's medium bodied and balanced, with bright acidity and refined tannins. An aniseed note marks the close.
Nowhere near as good as the 2008, with an overripe, pruny taste, and heat in the finish. On the plus side, it's dry and rich in tannins. Hard to see it developing, so drink up.
Sandrone has crafted a pleasant if slightly less ambitious wine than usual. It is a rich wine, with plenty of fruit, but overall is a little straightforward and lacks complexity.
Crisp and classic, with a nose and flavors of lemon, raspberry and spice. Clean and delicate, the wine will show well next to grilled seafood, salads and lighter fare.
A beautiful Pinot, silky, smooth and delicious. Although it has a tannic density that will permit aging, its lush black cherry, mocha and oak flavors permit it to be enjoyable now, especially with duck, lamb and steak.
Another wine from Portal del Alto that's just on the cusp of drinkability. Potent butterscotch and cream aromas don't seem authentic. Resiny flavors mask the fruit, and it finishes flat.
A rich wine, full of ripe red plums and sweet acidity. There is also a denser character, made up of concentrated tannins, dark wood and a structure that needs time to develop. In the end, the juicy acidity just bursts out of the glass, leaving a fresh, red berry fruit aftertaste.
Just a single barrel was made, pure Sangiovese from the Candy Mountain Vineyard. Tight, tart and dark, it captures black cherry fruit with black licorice and a whiff of smoke. At this point in time the tannins and acids seem to be fighting it out for control.
Organically grown and sourced from the Dundee Hills AVA, this is from the lighter vintage of 2007. It's balanced and ripe enough, but feels a little thin. What does stand out are the excellent aromatics, already sliding into maturity, and offering intriguing scents and flavors of cola, cured meat, moist earth, truffle and salt.
While hints of earth and bramble on the nose seem a touch savory, the palate of this concentrated semi-dry wine is richly flavored with fresh peach, orange and apricot. It's juicy and fresh, accented by soft orange acidity and a brisk finish. Drink now through 2018 to enjoy its fruity vitality.
Put this one in the cellar and forget about it for a good six years, if not far longer. It's tannic and youthfully rude in fruity flavor, and the oak barrel influence presently dominates. But it's finely made and pure, showing its Howell Mountain roots, and should easily develop bottle complexity for many years.
Plump and yeasty, with apple, lemon and green banana flavors. Very restrained and lithe, with a clear but distant character. The mouthfeel is supple and easy but it doesn't pack much punch. Finishing notes of mushroom and mineral are light. Imported by Empson (USA) Ltd.
The nose on this bright red blend from Sanders Ridge is spicy and smoky with abundant red fruit, leather and tobacco. The cheery red fruits carry through on the palate as well with a plush, but pleasant demeanor. There's not a lot of structure or depth, but it's an easy, fun wine.
This varietal Xarello feels more flat than vivid. It has fleshy yet generic white fruit aromas, ripe melon flavors and a tired finish.
This pretty vineyard-designate Pinot Grigio delivers a thick, creamy texture backed by fresh aromas of tangerine and apricot. Pair this with wild asparagus topped with melted butter and grated Parmigiano.
This vibrant wine shows the lighter side of Aglianico while offering great value. It doles out juicy wild cherry, white pepper and clove alongside bright acidity and smooth tannins. Pair it with barbecue or hearty pasta dishes.

This soft, gently attractive Rhône-style wine is a blend of Grenache, Syrah, Mourvèdre and Viognier. It has delicious flavors of tree fruits, berries and spices, with a mocha finish.
The blend is 50% Syrah, 26% Cabernet Sauvignon, 13% Merlot and 11% Malbec – pretty close to the '06 cuvée. You'll find juicy black cherry, raspberry and cassis in the nose, filtered with smoke and black licorice. This captures the strength of the '07 vintage with depth and detail, packaged in a sleek, richly-flavored wine whose half Syrah/half Bordeaux blend is in perfect proportion.
From the producer's Sebastopol Hills hillside vineyard, this is a perfumy, elegant wine, a combination of lavender and roses with sizable tannins and a backbone of acidity. Dark black fruit and game swirl together with a complex addition of dried herb and violet. This is a lovely wine now, but will benefit from further cellaring through 2023.
Marmorelle, a blend of Chardonnay and Malvasia Bianca, delivers an awkward, slightly thorny bouquet of chopped sage and mint. You'll also get background notes of white stone and drying talc powder.
A light cedary, floral aroma starts this full-bodied wine on an interesting note, and similar flavor complexity continues. It feels nicely astringent on the palate, as fine tannins and good acidity keep it lively.
Grapy aromas are spicy and woody. This is a full, packed truckload of a Malbec with earthy, baked flavors of blackberry and prune. Licorice and a mild blast of bitterness replace the wine's dark-fruit character on the finish.
Charmingly ripe and aromatic notes of juicy, yellow pear on nose and palate make for an ultrafriendly, easy-drinking and utterly fruit-driven wine. Drink soon to enjoy the amplified pear aromas while they're at their peak.
Ink, graphite, lemon peel, licorice root and reedy berry aromas combine into a solid, somewhat complex whole. This feels snappy and pure, with medium weight. Toasty flavors of plum and berry fruits are earthy and deep, while this finishes in good shape, with moderate complexity.
The nose is not inclined to give much away at this early stage. The palate, however, freely gives wonderfully tart apple fruit that has a juicy ripeness and the tang of lemon. The palate is dry and streamlined, with a wonderfully racy focus of freshness and concentration. Yet this remains svelte and toned. It is the lemony tang that creates such a deliciously lip-smacking and refreshing finish. Lovely now but sure to develop. Drink 2017–2027.
Feels lush and extravagant in the mouth, a full-bodied wine with smooth tannins housing powerhouse black cherry, bacon, black pepper and oaky sandalwood flavors. Give it a bit more structural integrity, and the score would soar.
Black-olive tapenade is the star of this show, along with fig, black currant and cedar. Bittersweet cocoa accents the powerful tannin and integrated oak, before finishing velvety smooth.
Bright, fruity Sauvignon Blanc that has a touch of tropical fruits as well as more citrus and grassy characters. Klassik is the most open, attractive, ready-to-drink style from Styria. Screwcap.
Delicious berries and cream nose, which follows through with crisp, spicy flavors and good structure. OVOC stands for “old vines old clones” and the fruit, from head-pruned, hillside vineyards, lives up to its billing. Great all-purpose Zin.
An immediately approachable wine with aromas of smoke, crushed stone and dark plum, this is a soft, supple example of its appellation. A bit of caramel emerges on the finish, where it coexists with mixed berry fruit.
JD is a sort of second label for J. Davies, which in turn is Schramsberg's top-tier Cabernet. The JD '09 is a very fine wine; it's intense and concentrated in cassis, with a lovely tannins that scour and plenty of new French oak to give it a toasty fanciness. Drink now-2015.
A smooth, soft and full wine, rich in fruits and warm acidity. A touch of minerality expresses the chalk soil of the vineyard. Still dominated by young fruitiness, it will be better in 2015.
The dynamic sisters that run this estate deliver a clean and territory-driven line of white wines. This easy Soave Classico opens with peach, pear, citrus and a touch of fragrant honeysuckle flower. It's pure and focused overall.
On the grassy, leaner side of the New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc spectrum, with grapefruit aromas accented by pungent, herbal scents. Despite the citrus and herb flavors, it's actually a bit weightier than many Marlborough Sauvignons, yet finishes clean and fresh.
The red berry and pomegranate fruit flavors are set against a background of dry earth, dried leaf and stem. It's balanced and detailed, definitely tilted more toward the herbal side of Oregon Pinot Noir rather than a fruitier style.
From the family that has made the variety from a three-acre block on Pritchard Hill since the 1960s, missing a few years to replant, this is such a lovely, well-composed and deliciously enjoyable wine it might induce tears of happiness, that's how good it is. Apricot, vanilla and cream surround a rounded, smooth lushness spiked in spicy nutmeg and tea.
Disappointing for this legendary vineyard; a soft, medicinal Pinot with funky, mushroomy cherry flavors.
Dried beef, cola, hot cocoa, ripe elderberries and teriyaki show on the nose of this bottling, which is a blend of 37% Grenache, 27% Petite Sirah, 15% Zinfandel, 8% Cabernet Sauvignon, 7% Petite Verdot and 6% Malbec. Black-cherry juice, wild thyme, oregano and smoky flavors show on the palate.
At just $10, Byzantium's Cabernet Sauvignon offers great bang for the buck. Pleasant aromas of ripe, red plums, espresso and toasted oak complement the lush black cherries and earth notes on the palate. Balanced acidity and firm but pleasant tannins extend through the coffee and black cherry finish.
Ripe aromas of dark berries blended with licorice and hard spices are attractive. In the mouth, this is round and blocky, with a friendly disposition. Flavors of blackberry, baked plum and black currant finish with licorice, chocolate, oak, mint and pepper notes. Overall, this is a fine Malbec to drink through 2016.
An honest-to-goodness traditional style of California wine, this smells like very ripe grapes and black pepper. Flavors are complex, a little earthy but well structured with sturdy tannins and echoing some of that ripe, raisiny fruit. The high-alcohol level suggests sipping it after dinner.
Exhibiting stalky blackberry fruits, this wine is on the austere side, promising some good aging. The fruit, acidity and tannins are in fine balance.
The best value among all of Bergevin Lane's 2008 Syrahs, this rich and smoky effort spent 20 months in oak. Sourced from Stone Tree and Francisca's vineyards, it has tight, ripe berry flavors and beautifully manicured tannins.
Strawberry, white pepper and blue flower aromas segue over to the bright palate along with juicy wild cherry and a hint of clove. It's straightforward and savory, with smooth tannins. Drink soon.
Still very tannic and heavy at the age of more than five years. It's quite soft in acids, which accentuates the heaviness, and the cherry, herb and tobacco flavors lead to an astringent finish. Not going anywhere.
This wine is dry, with extracted tannins that overshadow the fruit at this stage. It will probably turn out all right in the end as the acidify and black-currant flavors should come forward. Drink from 2017.
In only the winery's second vintage, this Chard offers a balanced experience with notes of ripe red apple, pear and pineapple core playing harmoniously alongside soft toast and vanilla flavors. The full, creamy texture is stopped from being too much by moderate acidity and a clean finish.
This wine shows real depth, beginning with earthy aromas of underbrush, ripe berried fruit, blue flower and smidge of leather. The palate offers a core of black cherry accented with notes of baking spices and a hint of truffle alongside a solid tannic backbone and nervous acidity that restrains the berry richness. Drink 2016–2024.
Equal parts Grenache and Mourvèdre, this appealing wine displays aromas of strawberry, orange rind and light peppery spices. It drinks dry with a lightly spritzy feel.
A lot of wood results in a bouquet that's heavy on the spice, sandalwood and clove but short on fruit. The palate offers medium-weight plum and tomato flavors, while the finish is chocolaty and clumsy, with a bit too much cream and thickness. As a whole it's awkward.
With its dark color and rich fruit, this is a powerful wine. It is jammy in its character, although acidity and wood also play a part. At the end, the acidity comes to dominate.
A brilliant white wine, very tart in acidity, with mineral flavors that make your mouth water. The flavors veer toward bright, tart citrus fruits, with suggestions of Chinese five-spice. The grapes were biodynamically farmed, which may partially be why the wine is so pure.
A very nice Pinot Noir that's likeable for its silky texture, crisp acidity and cherry, raspberry and Dr. Pepper cola flavors, with a long, spicy finish. Seems at its best now, so drink up.
This hearty blend of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon with smaller amounts of Malbec and Petit Verdot is a great go-to wine for a crowd. Cabernet leads the way with cedar, cranberry and tobacco notes, clipped by sizable tannin. As it opens, layers of dense raspberry and vanilla flavors unfurl.
For the price, this is an impressively detailed and complex wine. Floral notes reminiscent of lavender or rosemary mark the nose and impart interest to the palate, which deftly marries herbs, baking spices and dark fruit. Crisp acids combine with soft tannins on the silky finish. Drink now–2022.
With its apricot and ripe pear aromas, this is a full and rounded wine. It has a good balance between acidity and ripe fruit. It is floral, smooth and ready to drink.
The best Cara Mia yet, this is Red Mountain Cabernet Franc from the estate vineyard, with 15% Merlot and 8% Petit Verdot included. Stylish and compact, this seems sculpted with pure, vivid purple fruits, balanced against crisp, fine-grained tannins. The depth and concentration are noteworthy.
This Prosecco Brut does have a touch of wet cardboard that weighs down the wine's natural aromas of peach, citrus and honey. The appearance is bright and luminous and the wine tastes tonic and fresh in the mouth.
This extroverted reserve-style wine combines generous buttery and nutty nuances with crisp and bracing apple and Anjou-pear flavors to find a very good balance. It feels full bodied and luxurious but stays lively due to good grape acidity.
Made with 16% Merlot to soften it, this is an unctuous, fully satisfying wine, restrained and complex, grown on the family's Chiles Valley estate. It opens with ripe red berry and currant as well as a suggestion of vanilla, the oak providing structure and texture. Enjoy through 2025.
Grown in this cool appellation, this Spanish variety is crisp in acidity and bone dry, a refreshing sipper that shows flavors of citrus zest not unlike a Sauvignon Blanc, but fuller-bodied.
A snappy, jumpy type of wine that delivers aromas of red fruit and spice, but there's something piercing about it, too. The palate is clean and tight, with lots of cranberry/raspberry flavors framed by citrusy notes. Best if you prefer a leaner, shorter, crisper type of red.
Robust blackberry and herbal notes on the nose lead to a powerful, blocky palate with bold acidity. Well-oaked cassis and spice flavors are earthy, while flavors of mint, cinnamon and herbs grace the finish. Drink through 2022.
A fruity Pinot Noir, one-dimensional and ripe in raspberries, cherries and warm cola. It's a bit sweet, but pleasantly tart, with a nice, clean finish.
This offers earthy aromas of tobacco leaf and mushroom, along with ripe blackberry and raisin notes. The rich, round palate delivers plum, prune, black pepper and graphite notes alongside a welcome freshness that lifts the palate and adds finesse.
Enticing aromas of jasmine, honeysuckle and citrus blossom lead the nose on this polished wine. The sleek palate delivers juicy pear, crisp apple and nectarine zest. It's fresh and balanced, with bright acidity.
A fruity and rich-tasting wine, this has black plum and mild oak aromas, ripe cherry and slightly savory, beefy flavors along with a nice, velvety texture. It is dry, medium bodied and drinker friendly.
Bland, candied aromas are modest on the nose. Heavy and borderline cloying, this tastes of sugary cherry and peach.
A blend of local grapes (Zierfandler and Rotgipfler) this is impressive. Rich, perfumed, its fragrant fruits a medley of mulberry, pear and spiced apple. The acidity cuts right through, giving a wine that is both very ripe, balanced and finely textured. Screwcap.
This wine has aromas of cherry, cherry pie, pomegranate juice and dark chocolate. In the mouth there are flavors of cranberry, cherry cola and a touch of dried oregano. It is well balanced with soft tannins and a splash of tart cherry juice before the persistent finish.
Altesino's Brunello is characterized by fine tannins, good acidity and aromas of white cherry, forest floor and bramble. The wine seems less intense than past vintages and there's a slightly browning edge to its color.
Year after year this ranks as one of Chile's most complex and satisfying SBs. The nose is like an ocean breeze mixed with saline, citrus and fresh greens. The palate blends zestiness with fleshy weight, and the flavors suggest lime, green apple and grapefruit. Clean and long on the finish; drink now before it fades.
Gutsy and dry, an everyday red to drink with burgers. It has berry and tobacco flavors.
New French oak, to the tune of 50%, dominates this Chard, giving it buttered toast, vanilla and honey flavors that dominate the underlying pineapples, lemons and limes. The acidity is brisk and vital.
This stalky, smoky wine has red currant fruits and a tight texture. The fruit is just ripe, light in character with very fresh acidity. Some more depth would have been good. Drink now.
Year after year I taste this wine, and it always seems oaky and short on fruit. That said, it's a balanced, serious wine from well-tended vines, and it's made by folks who care. If you take the plunge, look for coconut and vanilla from the oak and dry fruit with touches of tomato and herbs.
Fermented and aged in stainless steel, this single-vineyard Sauvignon Blanc is medium bodied, with notes of lime and herbs. There's a touch of sugar to offset the tart acids, and the alcohol lingers on the finish.
This is Woodward Canyon's reserve—the best lots of Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot create this very limited wine. It is built to age, and reflects the tight and muscular style that Rick Small has developed over the years. There is a strong mineral-metal vein running through the black and blue fruits, and some very lively spicy highlights. Tannins are ripe but firm, and this is a wine that will benefit from further cellaring.
Smooth and ripe, this is a warm Grüner. It has white fruits, a delicious creamy texture, and a citrus finish. The wine is ready to drink, but could improve after a year. Screwcap.
This is predominantly Merlot, with Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah filling out the blend. As with many of the H3 wines, vanilla is the strongest and most noticeable flavor. The fruit is compact, and it tastes like hard cherry candy. There is plenty of power, but not much subtlety.
Winemaker Bob Bertheau lays back on the new oak and gives this great vineyard its due. A classic spine of juicy acid, with ripe—but not fat—citrus and apricot flavors. Long, balanced and tightly focused.
In 2001, Aliénor and Alexandre de Malet Roquefort bought this property which is 15 minutes southeast of their Château La Gaffelière. From 8.5 acres of Sauvignon Blanc, Sémillon and Muscadelle, this is a rounded, soft wine that promises well. It is going towards the tropical fruit area with its apricot and pineapple flavors. Behind, the acidity is tangy and crisp with a tight, nervy aftertaste.
Even though this wine is unoaked and inexpensive, it's one of the best Viogniers out there. It shows the lean, drily crisp profile of Edna Valley whites, with wildly exotic flavors of citrus, tropical fruits, wildflowers, peaches, pears, minerals and vanilla. At this price, it's a giveaway.
There is a very fleshy fruit smell on this wine from west of Paso Robles, with Meyer lemon and barely ripe melon aromas. The palate is nicely wide and ripe, with flavors of lemon-sprayed nectarines but also with elements of honey butter and honeysuckle that are reminiscent of oak.
Enormously rich and complex in blackberry tart, black currant, crème de cassis, licorice and bacon flavors. The tannins are strong but very fine, with a velvety texture. Give it 5–6 years to achieve bottle complexity.
Just makes it to that next level of quality via bright, jumpy, fresh aromas and flavors of raspberry and cherry. It's a simple varietal Grenache that's bright and easy to like if you're into zesty raspberry and berry flavors uplifted by spunky acidity. Best with a little chill on the temperature.
Lemony oak sits atop a heady bouquet supported by woody, baked-berry aromas. This is fresh and fast-moving across the palate, with rooty, toasty flavors of baked black fruits. A peppery, toasty, chocolaty finish is solid, dense and layered. Drink through 2021.
Packed with the warm richness of Alentejo, this is a dense, solidly tannic wine. It has power and weight, with a dark chocolate flavor and a bone-dry core. Concentrated and rich, with a sweet finish.
The renaissance of Clos Fourtet continues, even in this difficult vintage. This wine has great fruit, layering black currant with berries. It's a precise wine, pointing up the structured tannins while leaving room for a juicy, fruity aftertaste. Drink from 2020.
There's lots to admire about this Cabernet. For one, it's dry and controlled, with blackberry, cassis and chocolate flavors that are balanced with earthiness. It's also very tannic, although the soft acidity makes it drinkable now.
Made from unknown varieties, this is a big, sturdy, tannic and dry wine, made from a high mountain vineyard in this Lake County appellation. There's lots to like in the blackberry, cherry and red currant flavors, with their edge of dark chocolate and bacon. The wine is a bit sharp, but that could be a function of youth. Give it a few years in the cellar. A wine to watch.
What a great job Tolosa has been doing with Chard, and it's all about that Edna Valley terroir. The fruit develops powerful kiwi and lime flavors, which are generously enriched with caramelly oak. Meanwhile, the climate preserves vital acidity. It's a perfect marriage.
A little flat, but the nose is adequately melony, so give it points for that. The palate is on the plump, lower-acid side, so the green fruit and lychee flavors are fleshy. Finishes solid but soft. Drink this year.
This wine—made using fruit from 60-year-old Marsanne vines—is full bodied but crisp and reined in at the same time. Hints of toast accent citrus and melon notes that turn more lemony and lean on the finish. Could improve with 3–5 years of cellaring.
Just beautiful, a dry, silky Pinot Noir, filled with complex flavors of cherries and black raspberries. Oak adds lovely notes of sweet char, and the natural acidity of the Santa Maria Valley shines through. Now–2014.
At the age of five-plus, this is still a pretty aggressive wine in tannins, with a sandpapery astringency through the finish. But it's also incredibly fruity, offering a blast of superripe blackberries, currants, plums, dark chocolate and pepper. Seems best now and for a couple years.
This is a medium-bodied, somewhat chunky Pinot Noir, but does manage to combine plummy aromas with distinctively Pinot-like sous-bois character. The flavors turn tart and savory, ending on a pomegranate note.
This unusual wine is half 2005, half 2006 Cab, and includes 10% Syrah. It's lively and broad, with plenty of smooth and creamy chocolate filling in around spicy raspberry and red currant fruit.
Round, dark fruit aromas come with a pinch of grass. On the palate, this mountain-grown Syrah is enticing. Flavors of toast, raw oak, gravel and baked black fruits finish with spice and wood undertones. Drink through 2018.
Showing some rough, inelegant edges, this Cab doesn't seem fully ripened. The blackberry and cherry flavors finish with a green note, and the wine is fully dry.
Its acidity turned up high, this structured Barbera has a savory profile, smooth in woody, toasty flavor, earthy and peppery. Since it's built to age, give it an hour or two in a decanter or open it on subsequent nights to enjoy its evolution.
From a winery that names their wines after hummingbirds comes this Merlot. Hard to imagine a red wine getting fruitier and still remaining technically dry. Floods the mouth in melted cherry jam, blackberry marmalade, milk chocolate, blueberry and licorice flavors. Could use greater acidity, though, because it's a little flat.
It's certainly a big wine, as befits Madiran, but the tannins are well tamed, and contribute to richness rather than dryness. The texture is rough velvet, a smoothness topped by some tannins. Fruit flavors range from black figs to dark plum skins. It could evolve over 5 years, at least.
This bright and crisp Valpolicella Classico delivers clean aromas of cherry, blackberry and plum. The wine sees no oak and for that reason, its fruity characteristics really shine on the finish.
Cola, black cherry and lemony grit mark the bouquet, which is backed by acid-driven, lightly lemony flavors of cherry and raspberry. There's isn't a ton of volume, depth or follow-through to this wine; it is what it is: fresh, tangy and straightforward.
Floral, dusty aromas are encouraging, but this is overly citric and aggressive on the palate. Lemon, underripe stone fruit and minerally flavors turn tart and pithy on the finish.
Not what you'd call overtly fruity with its charred, reduced set of grilled meat and leathery aromas. The palate is more fruit-ladened, with raspberry and plum flavors getting a boost from vanilla and cola accents. Not bad but sort of rubbery and baked in the end.
Soft and earthy, with jammy cherry and raspberry liqueur flavors. Notes of crushed, fresh sage and smoky vanilla lead into a spicy finish. Texturally, this is medium-bodied and silky, rather like Pinot Noir.
Tomato leaf, field greens and bell pepper aromas flirt with berry notes, while the palate is snappy with cherry and red plum flavors along with a strong, obvious herbal accent. Mocha and green notes carry the finish. A typical challenged Navarran CS.
Some chalk and mineral on the green-apple nose, followed by tart citrus flavors that are propelled by firm acidity. Clean and lean, with scouring lemon to the finish. Potentially too sharp for some folks; others, however, may go for its razor-like personality.
Here is a lusciously modern Sangiovese (with small percentages of Malvasia Nera, Colorino and Merlot) with thick concentration and many layers of penetrating aromas that include ripe cherry, leather, tobacco, spice and vibrant forest fruit. Among the many Chianti Classicos to choose from, this is one of the best on the market, especially if you are looking for a modern, concentrated expression of the wine.
Named after the winemaker, Amélie Couillard, this soft, rounded wine is smooth with creamed apple flavors while also having a proper tangy of acidity. That tight and tangy edge makes the wine refreshing now while also allowing it to age for a few more months. Drink now or from late 2016.
Deep floral aromas are enhanced by traces of minerality and lavender-scented candle. This is a very likeable, clean and polished Grigio with full apricot and peach flavors. Imported by Empson (USA) Ltd.
Youthful and bright, Oltremé gives a new perspective to the Susumaniello grape. This demonstrates an informal style, which emphasizes the integrity of the fresh fruit flavors—cherry, blackberry and plum—which are surrounded by a soft, velvety texture.
This is the winery's flagship red; in this vintage it's 64% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Merlot and 14% Syrah. Sturdy and structured to age, the Syrah component pops in the pepper and spice, while the Cab and Merlot give it muscle and verve. Youthful, lovely floral notes and pure, pretty berry fruits shine in this ripe but graceful wine with sweet fruit, a pleasing midpalate and a clean and textural finish.
Made entirely from Nero d'Avola, this opens with ripe dark-skinned berry, exotic spice and blue flower scents. The straightforward, juicy palate delivers fleshy black cherry, blackberry and white pepper notes alongside firm, refined tannins. Enjoy through 2019.
A blend of Nero d'Avola and Cabernet Sauvignon, Sigillo shows soft fruit and blackberry aromas backed by a touch of the greenness—bell pepper or crushed clove—usually associated with Cabernet. There's heft and structure in the mouth.
This is ripe and dense, with great tannins; opulent, rich black fruit; and a fresh, juicy aftertaste. The structure and the solid texture both point to long-term aging.
Deeply pink with orange tones, this summer wine from Delfina's Vineyard shows a tangy sour-cherry nose with a touch of tarry complexity. It's yeasty on the sour-leaning palate, with orange bitters, plum and lemon-peel flavors.
Be careful when you look for thense wines, the labels at Aschieri are a little confusing;  a small white strip label at thumb level distinguishes the Sorano ordinaire from the special Costa Bricco. The wine, itself, is thick and quite poerful, with very ripe dark fruit, roses and earth flavors. It is beginning to show its age, and did not seem quite as fresh as the Sorano, but it proved to be more intense and extracted.
Dark, crusty aromas of spice cherry, mint and black olive lead to a lively, zesty palate with strong acidity and oaky, minty berry flavors mixed with notes of carob and black pepper. Olive, herbs and blackberry flavors work the finish, which brings kick and mild heat.
For a variety with little identity in California,  this one has plenty of personality. It's nutty and creamy, with detailed flavors of citrus rind and peach and a rich, but balancing, overlay of oak. It's also very dry with good acidity.
A mellow, well-rounded Petite that could almost be mistaken for blueberry tea, so prominent are those two strains of flavor in this wine.
This Beaujolais comes from a dense granite vineyard that has produced an equally powerful wine. It's mineral in texture, with aromatic black fruits that have been given a taste of wood from 12 months barrel aging. The acidity at the end as well as the tannins promise aging, so drink from 2017.
This is a thick, rich and chocolate-laden wine, soft and generously ladened with tannin. Cigar, cedar and dried sage remind one of its varietal intent, while its medium-bodied size allows for plushness on the palate.
Dry and soft. It's a good Cabernet for everyday drinking, with pleasant berry flavors and a smooth mouthfeel.
Smells a little hot and peppery, but the palate is big and expansive, with generous flavors of blackberry and vanilla. Round on the finish, if a bit generic, and not overly identifiable as Merlot. Still, it's an attractive, spicy red wine.
Offering aromas of citrus, stone fruit, white almond and toasted baguette, this also has a smooth, creamy density on the finish. The cleansing perlage would pair well with shellfish or raw seafood.
Dried herbs, blueberry and then a bit of forest-floor funk show on the nose of this affordable, widely available bottling by a reliable producer. The palate tastes like grape juice, proving even more pleasant when licorice elements emerge. It's perfect for a backyard barbecue.
Perfumed and rounded, this has fine acidity and a warm, sunny feel. Flavors of apples and pears are cut through with a lime juice note, yielding a balanced wine that will develop quickly.
A bit tough and rugged in the mouth, with dry tannins framing blackberry, tobacco, raisin, anise and cedar flavors. Ready now.
This supple yet mouthfilling wine boasts intense notes of garrigue--that Provençal blend of wild thyme, bay leaf and lavender--layered over hints of pepper and a base of cherry fruit. A hint of cocoa emerges on the short but pleasant finish. Drink it now and over the next couple of years.
Brambly berry and wood notes lend complexity to the luscious cassis and black cherry flavors. It's intensely concentrated with fruit, but bright bursts of acidity and layers of fresh sage and thyme add balance, leading to a long, harmonious finish. Drink now–2020.
Despite a good effort at balancing this wine, the Pepper Bridge fruit was just at the green edge of ripeness in this vintage. The wine remains tart, sharp and herbal, with some chalkiness in the tannins.
Despite opening with saucy, earthy, gaseous aromas, this mountain-vineyard Pinot delivers textural balance and modest acidity in support of peppery, toasty, spicy flavors of dried cherry, tomato and earth. A mildly spicy, round finish provides for a good ending.
There is plenty of fruit here, but there is also some richness, caramel flavors and a rounded texture that gives a sense of weight. Acidity at the end adds freshness.
At only 7% Merlot, it's unclear why it's even mentioned on the label, especially since it seems to be so obviously Cabernet in style. Cassis and chocolate notes dominate this richly textured, full-bodied red. Drink now.
New wood, mint and eucalyptus aromas lead to a palate that is dominated by wood. With the rich fruit underneath, the wine will come into balance, becoming warm and generous, typical of the vintage.
Dusty bramble aromas outshine delicate blossom notes on this zesty medium-bodied Sauvignon Blanc. White grapefruit and herb tones brighten the midpalate. While not persistent, its brisk finish is refreshing.
A wine with light tannins and juicy red fruits. Though the acidity is prominent, it has a soft texture and attractive strawberry fruit flavors. Not for aging.
A wine with bright, red and blue fruit notes that's full and structured, laced with pepper that gets better the longer you let it open up. The finish is long and has traces of sweet caramel and vanilla.
Velvety on the palate, this coastal wine from a site three miles from the Pacific Ocean shows cool-climate savory tones of cranberry, rose petal and pine, with streaks of black licorice adding to the complex range of flavor. Integrated and lushly elegant, it finishes in a strong touch of cardamom.
Certainly it is firm, with impressive power. But the smoothness of the ripe black fruits as they combine with the beautifully judged wood show a contrast of tension with the dense, chewy core. At its heart, this wine is dark and solid and concentrated, promising long aging.
This is a lightly sparking red from beautiful Sorrento in Southern Italy with sweet flavors of mature black fruit and spice. It's easygoing with low alcohol, which means you can throw back a few glasses with pizza without a second thought.
A big textured, smooth wine, sweet fruits with firm tannins finished with dark perfumes. It is a blockbuster, thankfully without high alcohol, balanced in its richness. A barbecue wine, ready to drink now.
Dark spice, forest floor, sun-baked soil and toast aromas lead the nose. The ripe, full-bodied palate doles out raspberry jam, vanilla, licorice and espresso notes, while close-grained tannins provide firm support.
Richly textured and spicy, this is a finely integrated wine. It has ripe berry flavors and a palate that's textured with tannins from fruit as well as wood. The structure, held within a lacework of acidity, reflects the wine's potential. Drink from 2016.
Made sugary-sweet, with lemonade and pineapple juice flavors that are offset with crisp, coastal acidity. The grapes seem to have come from Monterey County.
This medium sweet wine has attractive yellow fruit and mango flavors. It's soft, with a touch of honey and crisper lemon juice accents. Drink now.
Showing some mature notes at the age of four years or so, with a mellow texture framing cherry pie, cola and spice flavors. Feels silky, lush and delightful. Drink now–2015 as the fruit gradually fades away.
Aromas of dried herb, bay leaf, spice, dried flowers and dark fruit are followed by tart, spritely cranberry and cherry flavors. It possesses a real sense of freshness and elegance.
This is a prototypical Pinot from the most famous neighborhood of the Coast appellation. It's a big, full-bodied, heavy wine that's compelling for its dramatic dark fruit. Almost Syrah-like in weight, it defines an emerging style. Not an elegant Pinot Noir but it may be mid-term ageable.
Round and fruity, this is a crisp and pure wine. It has a straight line of acidity that cuts through the green apple and citrus fruits. The zesty texture dances on the palate.
Despite having a wealth of cherry and sweet, smoky oak flavors, unripe notes of green peppercorn and tomato mark this Pinot Noir. The structure is fine and the acidity is great, but the veggie taste distracts.
This wine is solid and dense with probably too much extracted tannins. There are only hints of fruitiness. It will soften although it's likely to remain stalky. This is the first vintage in which some of the vineyard was managed organically.
One of the better Sangioveses out there, although it's more like Zinfandel than the great grape of Tuscany. It's robust in rustic tannins, with ripe, extracted flavors of wild forest berries, cola, licorice, beef teriaki and sandalwood. At its best now.
A juicy Touriga with nice structure and acidity, it bursts with notes of strawberry, cherry and vanilla spice, especially on the finish. A perfect pizza wine.
The unoaked nature of this wine, as advertised by its amusing name, shows through in the unadulterated melon, cantaloupe and mineral tones. It's a bit hollow in the mouth, but has a sweet, round texture and pretty cherry and candied orange notes on the brief finish. Drink up.
A very dry style of Champagne that needs food. At this stage, this wine is young, with vibrant acidity  and dense, green fruit. But it has a long future ahead of it, and shortly should show some toast and maturity. Serve this with fish, and appreciate its qualities even more. Imported by Robert Chadderdon Selections.
An opulently rich wine from very ripe fruit giving soft tannins, a delicious layer of red berries and mature Cab flavors. There is structure there, buried under all the ripeness, but this is a wine to sink into, ready for immediate drinking.
Rich and full in mouth, this has green and apple fruit flavors that are cut with acidity. The tangy texture gives a contrast and balance to the wine. Drink from 2017.
Moscato aromas leap from the glass, taking the form of shampoo, lychee and jasmine. Feels light but choppy, with dilute lychee and green melon flavors. Not too sticky or cloying.
Blueberries, smoke and pepper-crusted beef aromas emerge on this solid offering. There's a lot happening on the palate, with flavors of tobacco, blackberries, dark plums and purple flowers, all grounded in tart plum-skin tannins.
Hay, papaya and tomato vine aromas lift out of the glass. On the thin palate, you can find notes of grapefruit, mineral and a hint orange peel alongside bracing acidity.
This is a soft pretty wine with a light fruity character. It is gently fruity, finishing with a peppery edge and crisp acidity. Drink now.
This blend is mainly Shiraz (50%) and Grenache (28%), which accounts for the wine's ample, plummy fruit flavors. Accents of grilled meat and slightly briary overtones add complexity, and the wine finishes dry and savory. Drink now-2012.
This polished wine offers an array of ripe cherry, pomegranate, persimmon and cola flavors, making it rich and sweet in the mouth. Yet the finish is entirely dry, and you'll find plenty of scoury acidity to rip through the greasy richness of lamb or duck.
Made solidly in the Mazzocco style, this Zin is very dry, tannic and very high in alcohol. It has a peppery burn to the blackberries, plums and tobacco, with a curious, but rich, maple syrup finish.
You can taste the warmth of the vintage in the ripeness of the wine. It just explodes with jammy cherry, raspberry, red currant, milk chocolate and vanilla flavors. Soft and easy, it's at its best now.
This easy-drinking Grigio from the deep south of Italy opens with bright lemon and peach followed by a thick, waxy feel in the mouth. It could use a tad more acidity to keep it fresh.
Aromas of sea salt, olive brine, smoked meat, herb and earth lead to medium-bodied fruit flavors that run warm on the finish. There are plenty of good things going on but they don't seem to entirely come together.
In the context of the rest of the outstanding 2009 Pinots from Soléna, this seems the lightest. Soft, spicy fruit flavors of strawberry and raspberry, accented with rose water, set up an elegant, thinnish palate, with residual tannic flavors of green tea. This could be a surprisingly long-lived wine, but at this stage it's anyone's guess.
Green pear peel and flesh dominate nose and palate and make for a fruit-driven, slender but concentrated white. The melting texture is an added bonus.
There's a note of wet earth or rubber that emerges from the bouquet before the fruit tones do. Once the wine is given more time in the glass, dried prune and cassis come through. This wine's tight, compact style would pair with most easy meat dishes.
An interesting, fecund nose carries aromas of wet hay along with cherries and plums. Well-balanced and high-toned flavors are bright and set the fruit against firm tannins and a layer of loam and graphite. Give it a few years in the cellar to bring out all the complexity.
This soft wine is yeasty with a strong bubbly mousse. It is balanced, moving towards the sweet end of Brut although with plenty of apple acidity to keep it crisp. Drink the wine now.

Soft and gently fruity, this immediately attractive wine has plenty of acidity that points up the apple and green plum fruits and final freshness. The wine is ready to drink.
Densely rich, very sweet wine. It has some smoky tannins that give structure, along with a dark core of dry raisin and wood flavors. It has concentration and an opaque texture.
Aromas of baked berries and spice are mature and complex. This feels rich and almost lactic, while oaky, buttery flavors of roasted berry fruits and molasses finish soft and cuddly, with a licorice note. Drink this very nice Uruguayan blend of Tannat and other red grapes now.
There's a compellingly nutty warmth to the nose of this reserve blend of 66% Grenache Blanc and 34% Roussanne, with pecan and cashew aromas as well as more tart scents of key lime peels and lemon mousse. It lands heavily on the palate with roasted banana flavors and a buttery midpalate, but it is cut immediately by a kumquat tartness. Fascinating sipper.
Chardonnay from Napa mountains? Yes. The wine is tightly packed and nervy, as far from a fat, opulent Chard as you can imagine. Thoroughly dry, with a minerality behind the citrus flavors, which suggests aging in a cool cellar for a good decade.
This entry-level Merlot offers correct plum, black-cherry, toast and smoke aromas. Similar flavors follow, with a soft mouthfeel, but it's not a rich wine. There are no hard tannins, but tangy acids seem to come up on the back end, where it finishes dry, with a dusty cocoa note
Stalky compost and wilted floral aromas are as present as the underlying basic berry scents. This varietal Alicante Bouschet is tannic and slightly abrasive in feel, while warm, bitter, peppery plum and cherry flavors leave heat and burn on the finish.
Shows very ripe, roasted fruit and brown sugar. It verges on overripeness, but has the acidity to keep it in balance. For a Barolo from a top vintage, it lacks complexity, but it is an easy-drinking wine.
This is a gorgeous Italian white from northern Italy that boasts fragrant tones of spring flower and chopped herb backed by peach, honey and white almond. It's crisp, intense and would be perfect with basil Thai curry.
With high alcohol and 100% new French oak, this wine could easily be clumsy, but it isn't. It defines the ripe California style. It's a little hot, but so massive in flavors of pineapples, lemondrop candy, crème brûlée and sweet buttered toast, you can't help but be impressed. A winery and wine to watch.
Aromas of wet dog and a whiff of skunk are hardly the stuff of legend. In the mouth, this is well cut and crisp, with fresh acidity and a controlled bubble bead. Briny flavors of celery, lettuce and scallion finish fresh, green and lean.
Soft and sweet, with a liqueur taste of raisins and crême de cassis. Dry, but hot. The official alcohol reading of 14.5% by volume tastes suspiciously low.
Shows the ripe, flashy side of Viognier, with orange, tropical fruit, pear and vanilla flavors. Brisk acidity provides fortunate balance. Drink now with Asian fare, a salad with savory greens and fruit.
On the earthy side, with aromas of damp wood and toast that far outweigh the modest blackberry fruit. It's medium weight, with a tart finish.
From volcanic soil, this ripe, but tight style of Muscadet is one that needs aging. Even after two years, the acidity has not completely molded round the fresh grapefruit flavors. It's lively, very crisp, demanding food.
This is a lean, simple sparkling wine with stone fruit and grapefruit followed by almond and melon. Foamy and crisp, pair this wine with seafood appetizers.
Don't expect explosive fruit from this wine. It delivers a pungent, spicy mix of cola, roasted meat and black olives instead, cushioned by ample weight in the mouth and a broad, creamy texture. Drink now–2020.
Deep ruby in the glass, this wine has a nose of blackberry, anise, and smoked meat. Smooth tannins wrap around flavors of black cherry, fennel bulb, green pepper and eucalyptus. A touch of smoke makes its presence known on the bright finish.
Extraordinarily delicious is more like it. This is full bodied, supple and rich, with luscious aromas and flavors of mocha, cassis and vanilla that finish long, with some soft, dusty tannins. With all the plushness and primary fruit, it seems a little young right now; drink 2018–2030.
A big ripe wine, full of tropical fruits that are balanced by grapefruit and final acidity. There is just a hint of toast, very discreet, rounding out this beautifully structured wine. The finish offers a great range of complex flavors.
This linear wine opens with aromas that suggest tomato vine, white spring flower and yellow grapefruit that carry over to the crisp palate along with a hint of zesty lemon peel. Racy acidity adds even more verve.
Soft Chardonnay, nicely balanced between ripe white fruits and some toast. It is an open, generous wine, enjoyable and ready to drink.
Strong wood aromas show in the toasty edge of this spicy wine. Ripe yellow fruits are full in the mouth, with a crisp, bright aftertaste to give a final lift.
Produced entirely with organically farmed Sangiovese, this earthy, structured red opens with classic aromas of ripe berry, fragrant blue flowers, leather and a whiff of forest floor. The savory palate delivers black cherry, crushed raspberry, licorice, ground pepper and tobacco alongside big, velvety tannins.
Midolini's luminous blend of Friulano, Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay delivers golden concentration and soft aromas of exotic fruit, honey and apricot. The wine is supple but dense on the palate and would make an excellent companion to pork with glazed onions.
A bit reticent, offering apple, lily and spring flowers for an opening act, followed by citrus flavors on the palate. The short-to-medium finish has a pleasant lemon edge. Drink up.
A fine blend with 60% Tannat that has been softened and filled out by Cabernets Franc and Sauvignon. It still does have a firm tannic core although this is surrounded by ripe black fruits and acidity. It has all its bright fruit and so could age further, although it is now ready to drink.
This immediately attractive fruity wine does everything a dry, fresh rosé should. With bright fruits, layered acidity and richness, it is very ready to drink with food.
A mixture of blue fruit and herb aromas lead to fruit flavors that show restraint and polish. It's a very pretty representation of the vintage.
With a high percentage of local Jacquère in the blend, this fruity wine has high acidity and cool, fresh feel. It is as light as a feather, highlighting bright fruit with a fresh, crisp aftertaste.
This is a soft, gently sweet Grenache, with raspberry jam, toast and cinnamon spice flavors. Drink up.
Toasty oak kicks off the nose of this bottling, and then come touches of vanilla, lemon cookie, flint, buttered toast and almost marshmallow. Flavors are quite smoky, with roasted almond and sea salt, but the grippy texture is the most intriguing part.
Aromas of barrel spice, vanilla, dill and blue-black fruit are bright and focused. The plum and barrel flavors show depth and a sense of texture, with lingering flavors. This wine is not typically Cabernet but it offers much appeal.
Very full bodied and rich, almost too much for a variety that wants some nuance. Floods the mouth with flavors of cherries, raspberries, cola and sweet, caramelized oak, wrapped into silky, refined tannins. Could pick up bottle complexity with 4–6 years in the cellar.
It's impossible to resist mentioning the moniker as Sassabruna truly is one sassy wine. The blend is 80% Sangiovese, with Syrah and Merlot. Notes of black cherry, plum and soft chocolate peel away one layer after the next.
This bright Dolcetto offers tones of mature fruit and wet earth that are enhanced by the wine's soft and silky mouthfeel. Clean acidity brings up the rear and makes this wine a perfect match to tortellini with a creamy cheese sauce.
An attractive, structured, balanced wine, showing floral aromas, deliciously rounded ripe fruit, held in check by fresh blackberry flavor. The richness is here, but it is subtle, giving a wine that is powerful but food friendly.
There's chewy ripeness in this 80-20 Negroamaro-Malvasia Nera blend with aromas of freshly brewed coffee grinds, blackberries, plum and cherry. Not hugely intense, but it is genuine with good structure and many food-friendly elements. Try it with barbecued meats.
Mostly Grenache, the aromas are vibrant, with notes of orange peel, stem, funk, smoked meat, white pepper, herb and crushed flower. It's light on its feet with abundant raspberry and earth flavors that draw out on the finish.
Here's a dense Shiraz from Lazio with aromas of mature blackberry, blueberry, cherry cola and root beer. The wine is soft and thick in the mouth with a chewy texture and offers loads of raw fruit flavors.
There's a bright, brisk vein of acidity in this dry wine, which stimulates the palate and gets the tastebuds watering. The true flavors sink into the middle palate, suggesting grilled pineapple, tangerine jam and buttered toast. A firm minerality grounds and braces the richness. Don't drink this Chardonnay too cold.
This is a pretty, delicately perfumed Pinot Noir, with elegantly intertwined cherry and herb notes. It's light to medium in body, with a finish that shows just a touch of sinewy intensity. Drink it over the next year or so.
This bright and easygoing Rosso offers cheerful aromas of cherry, blueberry, white almond, smoke and spice. It has a very nice tannic structure, and good dimension and density as a result. Drink it with red or game meats.
This is a nice, round, waxy sort of Chardonnay. The nose offers integrated oak, bath oil and ripe tropical fruit aromas. The palate rests mostly on citrus, i.e. mellow orange and tangerine. Thus it's not overly zesty or citric; rather it blends in vanilla and a spot of oak to lend character and a modicum of class. Drink now.
What a great follow-up to the 2009 vintage. You can put this in the cellar with entire confidence that it will age for likely 10–20 years, and actually improve. At nearly three years of age, it's rich and vibrant with black currants, blueberries and dark chocolate, and a big hit of sweet oak. But the tannins are impossible, locking the mouth down with astringency. It's a pity that most of the 2l,064 bottles produced will probably be opened too young.
Shows the exotic power of the vineyard, with wild cherry, raspberry, cola and spice flavors, and the crisp acidity of the far Sonoma Coast. But not one you want to drink now. It's tight, dry, minerally, aloof. Needs time. Definitely a wine to cellar until at least 2014.
This is soft, fruity and already delicious with ripe red fruits. There's no wood aging, and the wine displays berry flavors, balanced acidity and a soft, jammy aftertaste. Drink 2014.
Good, drinkable vin ordinaire here, but nothing to get worked up about. It's just a clean, fruity, vibrant house white.
Full, minty aromas come with freshness and don't overpower. The palate is spunky and offers grabby charge, while wild berry, mint and peppery spice are the main flavors. Dark and warm as it finishes; not a shy wine.
The vineyard is a great one, but this wine has some stubborn problems. It's dry and somewhat unbalanced, with awkward tannins and an unripe, green streak right down the middle. Tart acidity compounds the bitterness.
Interestingly, there are dried fruits and flowers with a touch of petrol on the bouquet. This wine sits really nicely in the mouth, offering a plethora of lemon-lime, melon and pear flavors. It's rich and ripe, bordering on the heavy side. But it manages to toe that all-important line of balance, and therefore it qualifies as a winner.
This is a nice expression of Sauvignon although it lacks intensity and staying power. If you're looking for a fresh and easy appetizer wine with aromas of peach, citrus and basil, this is a perfect choice. The wine is zesty, clean and crisp on the close.
This is an easygoing but richly flavored wine that starts with light toast and spice aromas preceding somewhat sweet jammy flavors, a soft texture and medium body. Petite Sirah, Zinfandel, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon formed the blend.
This Bordeaux-style blend is Cabernet Sauvignon-dominated, showing vivid red fruits, with drying, somewhat leafy tannins. It has an earthy foundation and impressive length, it just needs more bottle age to fully integrate its flavors.
This is a bold, ripe wine from the heart of the Alentejo. Perfumed, full of red berry flavored fruits and with a rich, soft texture, it is ready to drink.
A bold, ripe, perfumed wine with Baga tannins and acidity, this is not a wine for easy drinking—demanding rich, oily or fatty foods instead. It's a great example of this notoriously fickle grape and is packed with spicy fruit. Drink from 2018.
Another Cahors from the stable of Alain-Dominque Perrin, this one is the entry-level wine, made to be more accessible than his flagship wine from Château Lagrezette or the luxury cuvée. There's still plenty of toasty oak, but also some raspberry-cherry fruit and green tobacco on the finish.
Very ripe, as befits 2009, this is still a young wine. It is packed with fruit, some hints of wood, delicious fresh red berries and acidity that balances the firmly tannic core. Keep the wine a year at least for the full richness to develop.
Tasted twice with differing impressions; this score represents the average of the two. One look at the wine showed roasted aromas, and an orange-peel aroma, followed by sour red fruit on the palate. The second go revealed juicier fruit and pleasing, chalky tannins on the palate. Give it the benefit of the doubt. 600 cases produced. Imported by USA Wine West.
Aromatic with white flowers, it's rounded, soft and gentle. It misses out on acidity, giving the wine a fat feel. Drink now.
A dry style with just enough acid to lend focus and length, this is a fine effort from Simon Waghorn, the owner-winemaker. Hints of baking spices and ginger lend nuance to the apple, pear, melon and citrus fruit.
With 200,000 cases produced, this is the benchmark Merlot for the state, if not the country. The newest release needs a bit more time in the bottle; it has been stiffened up with the addition of Cabernet Sauvignon and a dash of Cab Franc, and it is showing its tannic, herb and olive components currently. Some cherry and strawberry fruit is lurking below, along with green tea flavors in the finish.
Made with 80% Sangiovese and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon, the shy nose eventually reveals notes of plum and baking spice. The lean straightforward palate doles out fresh cherry and clove alongside drying tannins. Drink soon to capture the remaining fruit.
Very soft, this has a melted quality to the blackberry, cherry liqueur and cedar flavors. Everything about it is so fine, though it could have a firmer structure. Still, it's an elaborate wine that will pair well with beef or lamb. Drink now.
Long Island is not typically known for Cabernet Sauvignon, but in the hands of winemaker Anthony Nappa (who also crafts excellent Cabs at Raphael), the variety shows remarkable promise. Juxtaposing heady notes of bramble and dried herb against a backdrop of luscious black currant and plum, this wild-fermented red is enticingly “savage” in style. Sharp cranberry notes and mineral tones lend edge to a lingering finish.
Soft and sweet for a Howell Mountain Cabernet, with one-dimensional red currant, mocha, cola and new oak flavors. Hard to see it going anywhere, so drink up.
A great, enjoyable Chardonnay, extremely rich and ripe, but perfectly balanced. Crisp coastal acidity provides a clean boost to the enormous tropical fruit and peach flavors. The oak is strong, but in keeping with the size of the fruit, providing crème brûlée, buttered toast and smoky meringue opulence.
A useful, dry, fruity Merlot for drinking with almost anything that calls for a full-bodied red. Shows red and black cherry, cola, chocolate and cedar flavors, wrapped into hard tannins. Might gain with a year or two in the bottle.
This sparkler opens with a pretty, foamy crest and medium intensity of aromas: stone fruit, talc powder, dried sage and crushed white pepper tones are subdued but intricate. It ends on a creamy, sweet note.
As it ages, Muscadet becomes more like Chardonnay. Here, the wine has developed ripe tropical fruit notes and a smooth, creamy texture. The seven years of age has softened the fruit and acidity, leaving a rich wine that is deliciously ready to drink now.
Made with 24% Cabernet Franc, 22% Merlot, 15% Cabernet Sauvignon, 14% Petit Verdot, 14% Sangiovese, 6% Alicante and 5% Syrah, this opens with subdued aromas suggesting ripe black-skinned fruit, toast and coffee. The palate offers black cherry jam, espresso and oak-driven spice alongside polished tannins. It's a bit shy on freshness, so drink soon.
Big, ripe and smoky, this wine is generous while having great freshness. It's packed with fresh strawberries and raspberries along with powerful tannins. The combination of structure and great fruit will allow this wine to age. Drink from 2022.
Good price, and okay for a picnic or backyard summer barbecue. Crisply tart, it shows sweet-and-sour cherry and raspberry candy flavors that go down nice and easy.
From one of the larger of the great grands crus of Vosne-Romanée and Flagey-Echézeaux, this is a dark, structured wine. It has power and juicy acidity that drive its black plum and berry fruit flavors. A dry core of tannins promises many years of maturing. Drink from 2026.
Acidic and harsh, with sweet and sour flavors of cherries and mocha, this wine has the benefit of dryness. Drink now.
The standout fruit flavors are melon and grapefruit, with a backing of wet stone and spice. It's a refreshing style, and a useful white-wine choice for shellfish and other white fish or simple poultry dishes.
Ripe and full in the mouth, this is a yellow fruit and citrus flavored wine. Tangy, salty and textured, it also has a rich feel with its peach and kiwi accents. It's a wine for aging, so drink from 2017.
A nice, crisp and bone-dry Pinot that shows plenty of elegant class. Satisfies for its silky texture and flavors of cherries, raspberries, orange zest, cola and mint. Drink now.
This wine shows intense mountain tannins and fruity concentration. The flavors differ from those produced in Napa's mountains, veering more toward red berries and red currants than Napa's black ones. Oak plays a major role, but never overpowers. With 24% Merlot, this needs cellaring; don't pop the cork before 2018.
Floral, fresh and delicate fruit aromas are followed by rich citrus, white fruit and flower flavors. This is full bodied yet elegant, with a feminine edge. Pair it with Indian or Thai dishes.
Menthol, aromatic herb, purple flower and new leather scents meld together in this wine. On the firm, focused, palate, clove, star anise and espresso hints back up Marasca cherry and cranberry flavors while tightly knit but refined tannins and bright acidity provide support.
Very ripe pear and plum notions dominate the nose. The palate has concentration and drive but still blossoms with generous fleshy fruit of great purity. This is an expression of joy and ripeness—of ready overflowing fruit kept taut and in focus by ripe orange freshness. The long finish has a touch of earth.
Lots of richness and a multi-layered personality make this deep-colored, full-bodied wine delicious and interesting too. It's a big red, with bold berry and black cherry flavors, an especially attractive texture that's velvety and firm at the same time, and a long, lingering finish.
This attractive, medium-sweet Riesling keeps the alcohol low. Generous apple and apricot fruit flavors make it a fine warm-weather sipper. Start out any picnic with a chilled bottle of this bright and vividly fruity wine, and you're on the right track.
One of Italy's great food wines (such as with duck, guinea fowl, rabbit or veal), Secco Bertani is an institution all its own. This bold effort opens with playful notes of spice and leather that are set against dark berry and cassis accents. The tannic structure is mild, but the texture is generous and enduring.
This Merlot is dry, firm in tannins and earthy, with cherry, currant and tobacco flavors that finish in a swirl of spice. There's a rusticity to the tannins that strongly suggests drinking now.
Like the D&J; Chardonnay, this is a readily approachable, easy-drinking wine with good varietal character. Cassis fruit dominates, accented by slightly herbal notes suggestive of mint. The tannins are supple, adding an appropriately dusty edge to the finish. Drink now–2012.
Sulfuric and gassy to start with, then tropical fruit and dusty aromas rise up. Like many varietal Torrontés, this has an oily feel and flavors of white peach, banana and nutmeg. Finishes somewhat flat and dilute, with mild bitterness.
Layered tannin wraps around smoky oak and big flavors of marshmallow in this full-bodied densely concentrated wine from the well-known site. Black cherry, earthy forest floor and classic cola combine to form a juicy core of succulence beneath the power.
The Antinori family's Brunello estate has seen ups and downs in terms of wine consistency over the past five years. But 2008 delivers an honest and nicely concentrated expression that seems to benefit beautifully from the slightly warmer temperatures in its lower altitude vineyards. Dark chocolate, cherry fruit and barbecue spice appear on the finish.
This is the densest, most tannic of Pride's new releases, obviously meant for the cellar. You could drink it now, because it's so lush, but the tightness suggests that the winemaker doesn't want you to. Buried under the astringency are masses of cassis, dark chocolate, sweet fresh herbs and smoky oak. Better after 2010.
The holy grail for many wine producers remains drinkable Pinot Noir for less than $20. This one lacks a bit of midpalate weight and richness, but does offer earthy notes of beet root and mushroom couched in an appropriately silky texture.
Previous vintages have impressed more than this one, which admittedly wasn't an easy year in Marlborough. The marriage of toasty oak and ripe fruit comes across as similar to popcorn, aligned with linear notes of pineapple and citrus that extend through the long, clean finish.
Attractive, soft, white-fruit wine, its pear flavors rounded and gentle. This is a perfect apéritif style, easy with light acidity to cut through the ripe fruit.
This wine is totally fresh, with crisp red currant and riper banana flavors—a bright wine that's all fruit and refreshing acidity. The family has been in the wine business since 1811 and today works with some 50 small-production growers.
From a vineyard surrounded by the region's iconic estates, this study of Pommard and 667 clones used 60% whole cluster and 20% new oak to produce black raspberry, alpine strawberry, chipped slate, dewy bay leaf and vanilla aromas. Bright cranberry and pomegranate juice shows on the palate, which is lifted by a potpourri of eucalyptus and thyme, proving lively and refreshing.
From a vineyard on the eastern side of the Silverado Trail in Oakville, this is rich and robust with a depth of dark berry flavor, tobacco and earth. Lush on the palate it's a special-occasion kind of wine, gorgeous and generous and a fine example of winemaking and viticulture coming together in a magical way.
A nontraditional blend of 35% Zinfandel, 31% Merlot, 17% Grenache and 17% Petite Sirah, this offers cooked strawberry, sea-salt caramel candy, plum pudding and sweet violets on the nose. The palate shows more dry restraint, with black currant fruit and herbs of dill, oregano and marjoram.
This has a brownish color at the rim and is marked by an earthy, leathery aroma. The wine has flavors like roasted tomatoes and black olives and feels soft and easy in texture. It's full bodied, but very mellow, mature and easy to drink. The blend is 85% Sangiovese, with Syrah, Primitivo and Cabernet Sauvignon.
Light lemon and vanilla flavors and a creamy texture make this wine easy to drink. The body is on the light side, too, with soft acidity and a mouthfeel that's not too thick.
This wine's nose offers cherry and caramel, but also unusual tomato and other vegetable notes, though in an appealing manner. Claret-weight and lean but not hard, it has a ripe berry flavor and a bell-pepper note in the mouth. It finishes with tobacco and herb accents, and a spicy note; can be drunk now through 2008.
Although slightly unctuous, this decadent selection is hard to turn down thanks to its enticing aromas and flavors of honeyed apricot, preserved peach and quince paste. A soft accent of crushed rose petal adds depth to the nose, while a lingering gingery spice flavor freshens up the finish.
This wine starts with a soft nose of rose, tropical fruit and a touch of spice. Its flavors of citrus and spice are complex but buoyed by a laser focused minerality. Elegant and classic, and worthy of aging.
From Ventisquero and the Mexican crooner Luis Miguel, this wine has color, heft and size but not a whole lot of finesse or elegance. What it does deliver is rich, basic Cabernet flavors of black cherry and cassis and some toast on the finish. Good but rather regular stuff.
Elegantly structured, this offers floral, wild berry and spice aromas. The focused palate delivers bright red cherry, crushed raspberry, leather, white pepper and licorice flavors presented with laser-like precision. Chewy but fine-grained tannins and fresh acidity provide the framework. It's already tempting but it's not fully developed. Drink 2016–2026.
Initially tightly closed on nose, this wine slowly emerges with time in the glass. The palate is more expressive, with sprightly lemon, aloe vera and the soothing notion of ripe green and yellow pears. There are pleasing shadows of pepper and herbal spice, but what is most convincing is the compact, complete fluidity with which this envelopes the palate. Another masterpiece that is so very true to its vintage from Birgit's talented hands.
Produced by the Domaine de Chevalier team, this is a bright and crisp wine with red currant and tight red-berry flavors. These are lifted and given a refreshing character by the acidity. The wine is clean, bright and fruity. Drink now.
Made entirely from Nerello Cappuccio, this offers cassis, Mediterranean scrub and vanilla aromas. It's straightforward and enjoyable, with raspberry, clove and white pepper flavors framed by lithe tannins. Enjoy through 2020.
A solid, ripe wine, very much a nouveau for food, with some rich cherry fruit and an underlying smoky tannin layer. The fruit is ripe and full.
A perfect summer blush wine. Made in the style of the southern Rhône, it's rich in strawberry, raspberry, rosehip tea, vanilla and spice flavors, brightened with zesty acidity. Just delicious with smoked meats, tempura, ahi tuna tartare.
Definitely on the grassy, herbaceous side, this second white wine of Vieux Château Gaubert has freshness. But it is the intensity of its grapefruit, gooseberry and green kiwi flavors that are dominant, given an extra edge of some spice.
Still young, this is tight, tangy and herbal. It has intense lemon juice, very fresh acidity and a touch of orange zest. It's crisp, fruity and needs another year. Drink from 2016.
This generous wine opens with aromas of ripe dark berry, ground pepper and graphite. The round, juicy palate offers mature black cherry, blackberry jam, menthol and licorice alongside chewy tannins. Drink through 2021.
Unpleasantly sharp in acids, and burdened with residual sugar, this is a hard wine to like.
Marked by strong acidity and minerality, this is an austere Chardonnay for drinking now. With a citrus flavor and a dry, honeyed richness, this sits on the elegant side of the Chardonnay spectrum.
Pretty dark and full-bodied for a rosé, and too extracted and heavy in cherry-berry flavors to be considered elegant. It's almost a red wine you could drink at room temperature.
A winning Malbec for under $20. The nose is pure and hits with a blast of licorice, tobacco, cola, blackberry and dry balsam wood. The palate is driving, with blackberry, black plum and pepper flavors. Potent but balanced on the way out. Drink now and over the next couple of years.
Gaseous and rubbery on the nose, this is overpowered by a tire aroma and heavily reduced berry scents. It feels thick and ultrajammy, with overwhelming berry flavors in front of a heavy, hot finish.
Bright cherry cola and black currant gives this Brunello a plump and fruity personality that is difficult to find in the wines of 2008. Those fruit notes are raw, bold and are followed by a soft touch of milk chocolate or vanilla. The wine shows a creamy, velvety texture with a point of acidity and alcoholic heat.
Aromas include white flower and pear. The bright palate delivers yellow apple, Bartlett pear, lime zest and bitter almond alongside crisp acidity that leaves a pristine finish.
Following a Bordeaux model, this is the second wine of Romaneira. Named after the bell that hangs at the entrance to the quinta, it is a ripe, lightly structured wine that is ready to mature quickly. Berry fruits and acidity give the wine its main character. Drink from 2017.
On the nose, this suggests thyme, toasted nut and ripe orchard fruit. The firm palate offers mature citrus zest and ripe pear flavors while a bitter almond note marks the finish.
Whiffs of pine fronds, smoke and spice lend a woodsy alpine flair to this dry, intensely mineral Riesling. The palate is bracing and bold, juxtaposing crisp greengage plum and lime against crushed minerals and lemon-zest astringency. It's a penetrating, thrilling wine that drinks well now but should only intensify in its mineral complexity through 2023.
While I prefer the 2009 for its clarity and freshness, this '08 is no slouching tiger. The nose delivers still-fresh apple and mineral aromas, while the flavor profile leans toward gooseberry, lemon and green melon. Shows some pithy bitterness on the finish, so drink right away or seek out the '09.
With light plum and strawberry aromas and almost sweet strawberry and marshmallow flavors, this medium-bodied red may be best with semisweet food like ribs in barbecue sauce or pulled pork. The balance and texture are on the soft side.
Dry enough, but the fruit has a baked, raisiny taste, suggesting that some of the grapes got by the sorting table in a shriveled condition. The finish is tannic and rich in blackberries and spices, but the wine is not an ager.
Aromas of apple and pear are followed by dry, medium-bodied fruit flavors, dipping a bit in the middle before coming back together.
With its aromas of citrus and honey and its exuberant flavors of tropical fruit and toasted spice, this is both pretty and playful. Sweet but full of finesse, the wine has floral element that adds to its allure.
Ripe berry aromas are heady. In the mouth, this hard-edged Cabernet is gritty and smacking. Ripe plum and blackberry flavors are backed by hefty but pulling tannins, and overall the texture is quite rough.
Good price for a clean, solid Cabernet, properly varietal and easy to drink now. It has pleasant berry, cherry, cola and herb flavors that have some complexity.
The wine is soft with a fine touch of tannin and some stalkiness. It has black currants that are ripe while remaining crisp. The wine is easy, accessible and ready to drink.
A unique blend of Grecanico, Chardonnay, Viognier and Fiano, this is an attractive white that offers pretty tones of mango, papaya, banana and a naturally creamy mouthfeel that ends on a crisp, clean note and a hint of almond. Perfect with grilled fish or light pasta dishes.
Leafy red fruit, candied licorice and a touch of toast add up to the bare basics on the nose. Tangy and short in the mouth, with a bit too much acidity resulting in a scratchy mouthfeel. Cherry and red raspberry are the dominant flavors. Imported by 31 Degrees South Imports.
An odd wine, with some favorable elements, but also a strange sourness on the nose and a mouthfeel that's a bit syrupy and sweet. In between, there are appealing dusty-minerally notes, and pineapple and pear flavors. Imported by Chapin Cellars.
Cool climate all the way, from the brisk, metallic, acidic mouthfeel to the flavors of citrus zest, with a hint of peach. The winemaker has added notes of lees and delicate oak that enrich the wine and bring it to completion.
Thanks to its dense clay soils, the Brunate cru delivers wines with high color saturation and aromatic caliber. This Barolo offers layers of black fruit, plum, spice, tobacco, cola and dark chocolate. The wine is firm and finely textured with power, dimension and personality on the long finish.
Dried cherry and raspberry aromas lead to medium-bodied, sweet fruit flavors that seem bit clipped. It doesn't all come together.
There's a reduced, concentrated effect to this wine, a bold expression of the variety rich in tobacco and black tea, the fruit bittersweet and elusive. Tightly wound, it benefits from air and time in the glass, and will please a Cabernet lover's palate most of all.
A strength of oak and burly black fruit in this single-vineyard designate makes it intense and big. In the background, an unexpected minty, forest floor quality overtakes the aromas at first, but blows off over time. The wine finishes as intensely as it starts, awash in toasty oak.
Ohiti is a subregion of Hawkes Bay, one of New Zealand's warmer wine-growing areas, but this Chardonnay is tight and tart. Orange and lime, also tart pear flavors dominate. Needs time, but will the flavors ever truly unfurl?
Punchy yet secure aromas of apple, pear, grass and green herbs are expansive. A forward, layered, sensuous palate delivers yeasty, toasty apple and pear flavors. On the finish, softness, depth and richness share space alongside acidity and length. Drink through 2019.
Slight in aroma at first, this wine slowly reveals a waft of lemon. It's light in flavor, and it delivers crispness, with a hint of oak on the finish.
Earthy aromas of bark and mulch, plus a hint of blackberry, turn  sweet in the mouth. It tastes like berry cola with supple tannins, but the residual sugar makes it syrupy.
A meaty, bulky, earthy style of Ribera with smoky, charred, new-oak aromas setting up a reduced-seeming palate with roasted, sweet flavors of black fruits and cured meats. Feels rich, sticky and candied on the finish. Needs a couple of years to knit together; may improve with bottle age.
Foch, a hybrid known in France as Marécahl Foch, makes up the bulk of this wine, with Cab Sauv (30%) and Petit Verdot (5%) supporting. Smooth, with high acid, soft tannins and a hint of sweetness. Tart plummy fruit characterizes the wine; there is also aromas of pastry and lemon meringue. The finish is mouthwatering, with good fruit, vanilla and crisp acids.
Pink grapefruit, a linear chalky component and the aromas of apricot jam on brie cheese rind show on the nose of this bottling from one of the region's oldest vineyards. There is tight focus to the palate, where green pear skins, pomelo pith, lemon zest and lime juice weave into an acidity that's strong yet expertly integrated.
A touch of wood aging brings spice and vanilla to this ripe, citrus and pineapple flavored wine. Very fruity, and with sophistication from the toast flavors, it finishes with almonds and the freshest acidity. Drink from 2015.
Although it doesn't come only from Cahors, this is a typical blend of that Malbec region. This is just a soft fruity version that has been made to drink young. Ripe and with attractive fruitiness, it is generous, easy to drink, given a juicy aftertaste with acidity. Drink now.
This is a pretty taut wine that combines a rich style with good, vibrant acidity. Yet it is described as 100% fermented in stainless steel rather than oak barrels. The aromas resemble toasted baguette, butter and toasted walnut, while the flavors are like ripe apple and almonds.
This bright, easy-drinking red offers aromas and flavors of wild cherry, crushed raspberry and freshly ground pepper. It's fresh and enjoyable, with soft tannins. Drink soon.
Ripe and extracted, this shows more of a bitter chocolate note than a fruit flavor. It has a very dry, firmly tannic character, with a dark, smoky feel. Powerful and concentrated, its pepper and spice tones accompany the note of black plum skin. Expect this to soften slowly over 4–5 years.
This smooth, full-bodied wine offers plum jam flavors, concentration, with hints of herbs, sweet berries, laced with acidity. From the Herdade das Servas vineyards near the marble quarries of Estremoz, this is worth aging for two years.
Bright and forward in Cab Franc cherry fruit, this dry wine shows plenty of polish and sophistication. Besides the cherry flavors, the other notable feature here is tannins. They're of the sticky, astringent kind, but by no means unpleasant. This is a wine that simply calls for very rich steak, to break down and soften it.
A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Petit Verdot, Malbec and Cabernet Franc, this wine offers light aromas of cherry, coffee, raspberry, flowers, citrus and tobacco. It's tightly wound with abundant cherry flavors backed by dry tannins. Best after 2018, with a long life in front of it.
A Bordeaux blend based on Cabernet Franc, this savory wine has rich flavors of baked black cherry pie, with the crust. The firm edge of tannins gives it a dry astringency, and it's clean and balanced throughout. Doesn't seem like an ager, though, so drink now–2013.
Fresh and fruity, this simple Chardonnay shows crispness as well as white fruits, orange zest and a lively lemon aftertaste. Drink now.
The second vintage of this Rainstorm rosé sports fruit flavors of watermelon and strawberry, with hints of fresh cracker in both the aroma and the finish. But it's the fresh fruit that's driving the flavor bus here, with some added length and detail as it winds down, perhaps due in part to the native yeast fermentation.
Lifted lemon purity surrounded by white summer blossom make for a fresh Riesling with wonderful balance, concentration and poise. It offers that quintessential acid streamline that Riesling-lovers always look for.
This delivers excellent value, with dark fruit aromas, tight tannins and a lingering spice note. The wine is aged partly in oak and partly in stainless steel. It would make an excellent partner to barbecued meats.
Heavily oaked, with pineapple and toast aromas. Very round in the mouth, and smooth, but ultimately it's not that lively or flavorful. The apple and spice flavors kind of lay flat on the palate, while the finish is rather oak-dominant.
Full and toasty, with roasted fruit, meat and leather on the ripe, robust bouquet. Blackberry and plum flavors are good, and the mouthfeel is manly if a bit tannic. Undoubtedly a warm-vintage wine with size but not a ton of depth. Drink now.
A big wine, but some persistent sulphur and earthiness on the nose results in aromas of leather, scrambled eggs and tobacco. Rugged on the palate, but that's to be expected for a big-boned Malbec like this. Flavors of blackberry and black cherry are supported by powerful oak, leather and an infusion of herbs. Drinkable now and best through 2010.
This has aromas of medicinal herb, red berry and a whiff of adhesive bandage that carry over to the palate along with mature apple and a hint of orange zest. Bitter almond closes the finish.
This wine shows a classic Washington Malbec profile of green, stemmy herbs, citrus, black pepper and plum along with light barrel accents. It's soft in feel, palate-staining with plum flavors, tart acids and lightly gritty tannins, disclosing blood-orange flavors on the finish.
Finely textured, with great minerality as well as ripe fruit. Flavors range from peach to lime, a reflection of the warm vintage and the chalk soil. Acidity is important, giving a contrast to the richness.
Always a powerful wine, this has the added benefit of being produced from a fine vintage, yielding a hugely dense and concentrated bottling. Power comes from the ripe blackberry and black currant fruit and from the dark, firm tannins. Age this wine at least five years.
Twenty percent of the fruit in this 2005 comes from Red Mountain grapes—though not yet from the newly planted estate vineyard. Rich, ripe, smooth and supple, this nicely styled blend is packed with good dark fruits and sweet berry jam flavors. It's supple and muscular, with well-modulated tannins, and layered flavors of earth, soy and black tea.
This is a ripe wine with its juicy black fruits and generous tannins. It has a mature character that's emphasized by the wood aging and rich fruitiness. There's a touch of pepper at the end from the alcohol which is a shame. Drink now.
Plummy cinnamon notes meet fruity coconut depth in this ripe, soft and brightly constructed wine that's rich and full-bodied.
Smells meaty, with a streak of eucalyptus. Taut, cool black-plum fruit warms the palate, where there's also a substantial amount of oak. Very good—it's nice to find hallmarks of the region for a reasonable price. Imported by Negociants USA, Inc.
A beautiful wine, supple and delicious. Classically dry and tannic, it shows fascinating, elusive blackberry, blueberry, currant and herb flavors, elaborated with sweet, smoky oak. Lots going on here, and it should develop nicely in the bottle over the next decade.
Obalo is a consistently very good to excellent example of Rioja crianza. This is full and oaky up front, with tobacco, vanilla and briary black-fruit scents. A flush, voluminous palate is balanced and delivers earthy blackberry and chocolate flavors in front of a lively finish with a touch of buttery oak. Drink through 2019.
This Chardonnay is marked by brisk acidity, and pure, clean flavors of pineapples, golden mangoes, stony minerals and smoky butter. It's made for drinking now with upscale fare.
This is one of the grand wines of the Douro, from the last estate to be founded by the legendary Dona Antonia Ferreira in the 19th century. This is a long-lasting wine showing a fresh character, with dense, dark tannins and intense floral fruit. This will age for many years, so don't drink before 2020.
Coming in one of the most beautiful bottles on the market, this wine offers very forward aromas of honeyed almonds, browned butter, caramelized apples, daffodils and honeysuckle. There's a marzipan-powered nuttiness on the palate along with candied apples, but lemon zest acidity holds it together. This wine overpowers white fish, but excels with cheese.
Beautiful mineral notes of campfire and carbon scream loud and clear and act as a preface to ensuing aromas of cherry, blackberry, soy sauce, balsam notes and cola. The wine has power and great intensity and its flavors linger on the palate for many minutes. A Marc de Grazia selection, various Americna importers.
Despite being essentially an entry-level wine, this is not simple fruity-sweet Riesling. Instead, it offers aromas of slate, citrus and an almost fumé-like smoky character, mostly dry, minerally, stony flavors and a long, mouthwatering finish. Drink now–2012.
Meant to be served chilled and young, this peppy red has vibrant berry-basket aromas and flavors. It's a fresh, happy wine, very juicy with pure fruit. Goes well with crabcakes, and probably just as well with fiery curries.
Here's a vibrant, ruby-colored blend of Cab Sauvignon, Merlot and Sangiovese, in equal parts, that delivers raw spice and typical aromas of Cab along with generous tones of red cherry, cocoa butter, toasted and mineral notes. Its bright acidity and silky tannins would pair well with braised meat and roasted potatoes.
Roasted and raw beef, dried strawberry, crushed marjoram and salt-and-pepper seasonings show on this Syrah. Extremely dark in the glass, it's bolstered by 4% Grenache, 4% Mourvèdre and 2% Viognier. Elderberry fruit kicks off the palate, following by pepper, coffee grinds, espresso beans and dark-chocolate sauce, surrounded by grippy tannins.
A big blast of oak rises up from the glass, a barrier to what fruit might lie below. Once you get to the palate, there's tight but somewhat tart raspberry and a touch of leather. Not nearly as ripe and rich as the oak on the nose calls for; thus the end result is almost sour, which isn't an attribute when it comes to Malbec.
La Mano smells dry and spicy, with modest but present oak aromas and vanilla-tinged plum and berry scents. It's angular in feel, but the flavors of oak-based black fruit and raspberry work. It finishes mild, with some oaky residue.
Chandler Reach vineyards supplied the fruit. This is tart, opening with sharp berry flavors and lots of citrus, then settling into a moderately long finish that brings in a mix of strawberry, raspberry and cherry fruit. It's simple but ready to go.
The rosé is especially nice; with a pretty cherry core of sweet fruit. Basically it is free run (saignée) juice with a smidgen (two percent of  still wine added to brighten the color. Barrel aged and fermented; 300 cases produced.
This linear white opens with aromas suggesting gooseberry elderflower, Alpine herb and citrus. The tangy palate offers grapefruit, honeydew melon and white stone fruit while a mineral note adds depth.
Tart and crisp, this is a fairly “green” version, boasting plenty of gooseberry and jalapeño-pepper aromas and flavors. Residual sugar is just below the typical detection threshold of 5g/L; there's enough to add weight without making the wine seem sweet.
Rather overripe, this Cab has the flavors of stewed or baked blackberries and raisins. On the plus side are rich chocolate and anise notes, smooth, firm tannins and a dry, spicy finish.
Reversing the often-seen Washington penchant for tossing Syrah into the Cab, this does the opposite, with 10% Cabernet in the blend. It's showing plenty of ripe red berries and cherries, along with smoked meat and bacon fat. The finish is clean but does not lead into any new directions.
Made from the native grape Pugnitello, this hearty red opens with aromas of dried Mediterranean herbs, scorched earth, allspice and overripe black fruit. The warm, forward palate doles out baked plum, ripe blackberries, blue flowers, clove and the heat of evident alcohol. Velvety tannins wrap around the palate, but the dominant alcohol throws it off balance and gives it a monolithic character.
The first vintage of this wine was only in 2002, but already this bottling is proving to be excellent. Floral elements mark the nose, along with spice and blackberries, while the tannins are wonderfully soft, imparting a deliciously lush mouthfeel. Firms up a bit on the finish, suggesting that it should age well through at least 2014.
This is a flashy Chardonnay, marked by scads of oak that contributes buttered toast and vanilla cream. You find rich fruit flavors of pineapples and golden mangoes, but they struggle to overcome the barrel influence. Still, there's no denying the opulence. Drink now.
More commonly found in the Lisboa region much further south in Portugal, the Arinto is full of acidity and fits well into the Vinho Verde profile. This wine is crisp with plenty of apple and spice flavors as well as a strong lime-juice freshness. It's an attractive, medium-bodied wine to drink now.
This is a sophisticated blend of tart yellow fruits with hints of cucumber, salad greens and lemon oil. Though 80% stainless steel fermented, the rest spent time in new oak. The mineral rich acids provide extra grip.
Vibrant and elegant, this opens with scents of citrus blossom, Golden Delicious apple and a whiff of herb. The bright palate offers tangerine zest, mineral hint of almond alongside bright acidity.
While there is plenty of berry fruit and spice here, there is an awkward petrol character that also shows itself in the shoe polish aromas. If this can blow off, then this is a wine with potential richness. Since it is only just bottled, time will tell. But be cautious. Two bottles tasted. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.
This wine is still young, showing more of its red fruits than the structure that will develop. The crisp, red cherry flavor shows the freshness and acidity of the vintage. It will be better in a year, so drink from late 2015.
This is the lightest in a series of wines featuring the Avesso grape. Herbal, crisp and with plenty of acidity, it's also fruity and ready to drink.
This has nowhere near the complexity of Sanford's single-vineyard bottlings. It seems pricy for what you get, which is a basic Pinot that's dry and silky, with pleasant cherry candy and cola flavors.
Aged in neutral French oak, this wine opens with appealing aromas of black pepper, dried herbs and citrus peel. The palate is fresh and strikingly pure, with plenty of tart ground-meat and pepper flavors that hang on the finish. The texture is mesmerizing.
While the wine does have richness, it's the mineral and citrus side that is coming through at this stage. The balance with the wood aging is so right that you feel the toast rather than tasting it. As it matures, the wine will deepen in intensity and power, certainly over the next 5–10 years.
This full and structured wine offers good acidity, firm tannins and layers of black-currant flavors. It has good potential with richness, weight and balance. Drink from 2019.
Big and forward, with spicy, pungent aromas and also a softening hint of bread dough. The palate features snappy red fruit with drying oak in support. The tannic structure holds its own but doesn't rise up too much. A weighty, driving wine.
The prestigious Osoyoos Larose project just released Pétales—its second wine—blended from barrels that were given the same first-class treatment as Le Grand Vin. Organic, earthy, leafy flavors infuse the dark, smoky fruit. At half the cost of its big brother, Pétales is also more accessible and offers much the same challenging complexity.
Earthy and rugged at first, then it smoothes out to show cola and lush berry aromas. Plump and round in the mouth, with jammy blackberry core flavors, a hint of herbs and spice, and then a chewy, sticky, generous finish. Very nice Malbec with a cool identity.
Sweet and fresh smelling, with aromas of lime, pear and peach. The palate is all about citrus, with some spice and mineral thrown in for good measure. Balanced and zesty, like Albariño should be.
This Tuscan blend of 85% Sangiovese, 7% Ciliegiolo, 5% Canailo and 3% Malvasia opens with aromas of underbrush, oak and a whiff of farmyard. The palate is tired. While you can detect black cherry, plum, black pepper and espresso, the fruit is starting to fade, leaving astringent tannins unsustained by fruit richness.
Ripe cherry aromas swirl into graphite minerality, sweet wood and sagebrush scents in this delicious Jim Clendenen wine. The density on the palate is just about perfect, as is the tannic tension and mouth-cleansing acidity, with rich flavors of chemise, very ripe raspberry and elderberry juice proving quite sultry and addictive.
Coming from a blend of fruit from the Walla Walla Valley, Red Mountain and Yakima Valley appellations, this wine opens with high-toned aromas of spice box, dark cherry, earth, tobacco and herb. The flavors are full and tightly coiled, with lightly grained tannins giving support. At times it seems a bit dried out.
The winery held this back an additional six months after their other 2008 Pinots were released, presumably to let it become integrated. Still, it's quite tannic, with a sandpaper-like toughness. Despite the astringency, the massive wild-cherry, cola, mushroom and anise flavors come through. It's a huge wine, feral and untamed—quite exquisite in its wildness. So delicious now, it's hard to resist, but the wise collector will cellar it for 4–5 years, maybe even longer.
This smells like waffles and maple syrup, and feels very generous. The smooth texture shows moderate tannins, while a brown-sugar note rounds out the finish.
Rich and structured, this features tannins that pack the same weight as its ripe black fruits. A wood element shows in the background. The balance is likely to come together in the next year.
Sweet melon aromas mixed with mango are friendly and persistent. Full in the mouth, with a bit of creaminess accenting spice-infused melon and apple flavors. Meets the requirements of a solid Gewürz. Imported by W.J. Deutsch & Sons.
This is dry, almost sour, despite its low alcohol, and feels disjointed. Along with the sour citrus flavor is a conflicting streak of too-ripe fruit. Interesting components, but they may or may not knit together with more bottle age.
This unique expression of Sangiovese Grosso is influenced by oak tones to produce aromas of Spanish cedar and sandalwood, giving the bouquet a rich personality. Bold fruit tones of cherry and blackberry also come into focus, and the wine is surprisingly firm in the mouth.
Bristling with lime zest and a steely, mineral tone, this dry, moderate-bodied Riesling is elegant and refreshing from start to finish. It's packed with white peach and apricot flavors, but zippy and bright with hints of fresh herbs that linger on the finish.
Lusciously ripe notes of apricot and honeydew melon demand attention. The palate is more toned down but has dimensions of peppery arugula and lovage leaves. The finish is long and savory with a citrus kick.
Jammy and thick, and in the prime of its youth showing ripe, bold flavors of black cherries, chocolate and oaky vanilla, offset by creamy tannins. It's soft and almost sweet. Try with anything from braised ribs to vanilla ice cream.
Call it the poor man's Pinot Noir. It's dry and silky, and offers enough cherry, licorice, cola and spice flavors to satisfy.
Siran is in the south of the Margaux appellation just where the gravel outcrops rise above the river. It shows its fine position in this tannic wine. It has all the black-currant fruit buried for the moment under the structure. It is a serious wine that will repay aging. Drink from 2022.
Made with Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, this has aromas of black-skinned berry, violet, toasted oak and a whiff of dark baking spice. The soft palate offers black currant, espresso, French oak and a hint of dried sage alongside fine-grained tannins and bright acidity.
From a low-yielding vineyard full of galets, or stones, comes an excellent and dark wine, with aromas of cherry pie in a mint-speckled crust along with graphite and blueberry. The palate is a swirl of cola, rooibos tea and blackberry juice, with sharper eucalyptus notes coming through on the finish.
Deep, rich and spicy, and with a vineyard-driven flavor that shouldn't be taken lightly (it's from the well-regarded Sleepy Hollow and Pisoni vineyards). This is full-bodied, full-force Pinot with high alcohol (14.7%) that nonetheless maintains a semblance of balance. Cinnamon and nutmeg nuances add to the vibrant core of first-class raspberry/cherry fruit. Heft is both its bane and its beauty.
Brilliant and vibrant yet concentrated, with tangerine, yellow peach and honey flavors, this wine is a roller coaster of flavors and textures on the palate. Luscious sweetness is balanced by bracing acidity and a lingering saffron-kissed finish. Drinks beautifully now, but will deepen in intensity for decades to come.
This Cab-Malbec mix starts with sweet, syrupy aromas that grow more masculine with airing, with violet and rose petal scents along with some oak-driven caramel. The palate is round and sizable, with chocolate and plum flavors. Finishes meaty and chunky. From a newer winery owned by Codorníu of Spain.
With its pungent scents of cracked pepper and potent berry aromas, this is not a shy Shiraz. On the palate, it delivers an intriguing blend of vanilla and berries, marked by more sauvage elements of peppercorn and grilled beef, all wrapped in a sturdy, well built package of ample weight, adequate acidity and dusty tannins. Drink now–2020. Imported by Tom Eddy Wines.
Rubbery and dark on the nose, with lots of black plum and cherry to ponder. The palate is firm and balanced, with round, rubbery, roasted plum and dark berry flavors. Full, nice and long enough on the finish to keep you involved.
This cool-climate wine needs a warm vintage to show its best, and it certainly got heat in 2004. The result is a big, opulent wine with masses of tropical fruit flavors slathered in spicy oak. Yet it retains crisp, citrusy acidity, and has an elegant streak of minerality.
This wine is filled with robust Zinny flavors, ranging from wild raspberries and red currants to tobacco, mocha and crushed black pepper. It's just beginning to pick up aged notes, making it sweeter and more mellow than it would have been two or three years ago. Kudos to Balletto for holding it back before  release. Drink now–2016.
Here is a friendly, fruity, medium-bodied wine with light apple and pear aromas. Off-dry flavors are more melony and floral, and the wine has a relatively soft texture. Made from old vines and fermented in stainless steel, it offers subtle charms.
A little one-dimensional, but clean and crisp in acids, with the exotic floral and spice flavors the variety is noted for. Try with Asian fare.
Slate, smoke and tart and tropical fruit scents mix in the beguiling nose. This concentrated wine is still young and tight, but it already shows rich, full fruit flavors that broaden into a full, generous finish as it breathes. The brisk acidity and mineral-slate elements add depth and complexity. Can use a few years to show all its best stuff.
Meritage wines must be Bordeaux blends; otherwise, they can be all over the map. This is an all-purpose, affordable red blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec. Black cherry and olive, smoke and some noticeable alcohol (14.4% is credited) define a sturdy red in wide distribution.
Tropical fruits start this one off and on the palate, toasted oak and butterscotch join in. The structure is solid and the acid just right. This is a clean, decent Chardonnay.
This Valencia blend opens with aromas of latex, Band-Aid and jammy red-berry fruits. It's wide in the mouth, with a mix of buttery oak, herbal berry and minty plum flavors. This is good but shows a distinct green side on the palate and finish.
Not nearly as intense and Cab-like as the 2003. For whatever reason, this vintage is bouncy and light, with a touch of smoked meat and rubber but mostly simple raspberry and cherry flavors. The feel borders on jammy, and it finishes with a touch of chocolate but also kind of herbal.
From a cool, well-known site in the new appellation, this wine offers a complexity of coconut macaroon, clove and cinnamon. Well-formed flavors and aromas accent a moderate level of acidity and tannin, providing elegant balance.
Dusty apple aromas are less citrusy than ideal, and the palate is cidery and tangy. Finishes with heft, length and weight, which all seems a little overbearing given the wine's simplicity. Just good enough but doesn't fully click.
Made from Cabernet Sauvignon, this has funky, yeasty aromas of pink grapefruit and passion fruit that turn citrusy and briny if given time. On the palate, this recalls orange juice. Orange, grapefruit and generic tang proceed from the flavor profile to the finish.
A blend of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon that comes from the small region of Buzet in the north of Gascony. This wine has tannins that are already well integrated with the black currant fruits and acidity. It is going to develop further into a rich, smooth wine. Drink from 2018.
Soft, plush and approachable, this Sicilian Merlot offers all the prerequisites of an enjoyable, well-priced everyday dinner wine. The wine is rich and velvety with bright cherry flavors followed by spice and cola. It's the perfect wine to sell by the glass.
Made from a blend of grapes from the estate's top vineyards, this vivacious dry Riesling balances crisp mineral tones against ripe, tropical notes of mango, pineapple and melon. It's lusciously mouthcoating yet cut with strikes of tangerine and lime. Delightful now, but structured enough to improve through at least 2023.
Lusty and robust, this Cab, Merlot and Syrah blend combines peppery, briary flavors with riper fruit notes of blackberries and plums. The texture is especially appealing, with its rich, complex tannins, from both the grapes and from oak. Good job in a dry red wine at a fair price.
Notes of fresh herbs and melon rind lend a verdant tone to this semi-sweet, late-harvest wine. The palate is crisp with tart green apple and peach flavors, but imbued with touches of exotic orange spice and honey that linger mysteriously on the finish.
Very polished and pure, if a bit direct and obvious in appeal. A beautiful wine, with pure flavors of currants and cedar. Drinkable now, and should hold through the decade.
There's plenty of nuance on this wine's aromas and flavors of café au lait, herb, dark cherry, plum and barrel spice. The balance is pitch-perfect with a light grip of tannins that need some time in the cellar to soften.
A satisfying blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay which gives a roundness to the mineral layers of Sauvignon, while giving a lift to the Chardonnay. This is a fresh, crisp wine which would work as an aperitif, with its lift of soft fruit to finish
A sound, everyday Pinot Grigio, with good citrus and spice flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. Gets the nod for simple richness.
Starting to show its age with a pale golden hue, this fumé is classy and restrained. Aromas of waxy lemon, pineapple and green bean mingle with base notes of butterscotch and smoke from the oak. The palate offers less excitement with the fruit disappearing some and searing acidity taking over. Nevertheless, this wine would be a versatile pairing for a variety of dishes.
This is indicated as a reserve-level selection, but at the moment remains unfocused, and even a bit dilute. Tart fruits and tight tannins never quite fit together. The drying finish carries a hint of wet cement. Give this at least another year or two of bottle age.
Spicy aromas of licorice, menthol, vanilla sauce and sweet wood frame the brambly-berry fruit center of this Cabernet-Merlot blend. Berry-preserve flavors are more pronounced on the palate, with its lush, round mouthfeel, and assorted spice flavors on the finish. Drink now–2015.
It's pretty rare in France to find a blend of the Spanish grapes Monastrell and Bobal. But they do produce an attractive, fresh, raspberry flavored, freshly pink colored wine. The aftertaste is soft, with some light residual sugar.
A dusty mineral note of talc power or white stone opens the nose of this vineyard-designate Prosecco. The wine is simple and crisp in the mouth with a touch of fresh peach and basil on the soft close.
Made in honor of Christian Moreau's father, Guy, this is produced from 70-year-old vines that bestow serious concentration and density. It has as much yellow fruit ripeness as citrus and minerality. Put together, these elements give an ageworthy wine. Drink from 2018.
Light cherry and berry aromas are a bit candied, and the palate is more so. It's almost sugary sweet, but fortunately the wine has good acidity and bounce, so it's not cloying or sticky. Definitely for fans of white Zin and other sweet rosés.
Softly fruity wine, with a touch of toast, ripe pear and melon flavors. The wine is warm, approachable, fruity, ready to drink.
Toasty aromas suggest maple, along with a note of sawdust to accompany earthy berry scents. A rich, pure palate is intense but shows balance and comportment. Blackberry, cassis, peppery spice and integrated oak flavors are detailed, with a smooth finish. Drink this full-bodied wonder through 2028.
This is a nice wine, very dry and crisp in acidity, with a sleek, minerally taste. It feels like a Sauvignon Blanc, but the flavors are much richer, suggesting peaches, nectarines and golden mangoes. The wine was barrel fermented.
The Viognier component adds a wonderfully creamy, fat texture to this wine, but doesn't impose on the Shiraz aromatics of blueberries and blackberries. It's lush and fruit-filled, finishing with a touch of licorice. Drink now–2015. Multiple U.S. Importers.
This extraordinary vintage of Cerequio offers impressive harmony and balance. Every element is in place and the wood and spice notes blend seamlessly with red currant and licorice. The intensity of the wine is also noteworthy as is its firmness and the powerful impact it makes.
The wine is rich and ripe, revealing purity of fruit as well as prominent new wood flavors. Otto Rettenmaier, whose cellar is full of wooden cuves named after opera stars, now operates in a biodynamic way and that seems to give an intensity of flavor as well as lusciousness and opulence. Drink from 2010.
This blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot, 10% Cabernet Franc and 10% other varieties has aromas of green bell pepper, toasted oak, plum, blackberries, graphite and chocolate that all carry over to the palate. It's not very complex and not an ager so enjoy soon.
This blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot shows impressive intensity and carefully measured oak tones that add nuances of clove and nutmeg. At the base are notes of red fruit, cherry and blackberry, plus dried tones of prune and cassis.
This wine boasts aromas and flavors of dried red fruits, fresh mint and cocoa powder. Medium weight, with soft, dusty tannins and a medium-length finish. A young wine, but quite approachable now.
Better known for his Châteauneuf-du-Pape, Domaine Roger Sabon actually owns more acreage on the Lirac side of the river. This cuvée, made from 40-50-year-old vines, is a big, muscular Lirac marked by hints of tree bark and dark, plummy fruit. Powerful and long on the finish; drink from 2008–2015.
Very fine and high-toned, a Cabernet that shows real class and pedigree. Entirely drinkable now for its soft, lush tannins and elaborately detailed blackberry, black cherry, anise, carob and cedar flavors that last long through a spicy finish. Should age well through 2015.
Impressive wine, perfectly balancing its tannins and its stylish medicinal and herbal fruit flavors. It's juicy, with mouthfilling black currant flavors. A wine to age for several years, but likely to be drinkable, with softer tannins, in 2012.
Almost completely subdued, the nose suggests only faint earthiness. The palate is rounded and full of ripe pear but lacks focus.
A standout in a flight of pricier Chardonnays, this young wine is tight and focused, with a pretty toasty edge. Fresh apple and white peach flavors have taken on a lot of new oak, but have the stuffing to absorb it, especially with a bit more bottle age. A lot of vanilla, custard and almond-cookie goodness fills out the finish.
Scattered, candied-fruit aromas are in your face and aggressive. It feels flush but not fully concentrated, with herb-tinged flavors of black fruit, spice, olive and licorice. This finishes quick, with juicy acidity.
This offers alluring black-skinned berry, violet and tobacco aromas. The savory, structured palate delivers black cherry and chopped mint flavors, with clove accents, bright acidity and fine-grained tannins.
Rustic and not quite ripe, with dry, astringent tannins framing flavors of currants, anise and vegetables.
Citrus and aromas of freshly cut grass appear on the nose of this easygoing Pinot Grigio (made from organically-grown grapes). This is a simple and unpretentious wine that would wash down well with mini-pizza appetizers and fried mozzarella sticks.
There's slight buttercream alongside nectarine, Gala apple and just-ripe melon in this offering from Central Coast veteran Stephen Ross Dooley, who sourced the historic Bien Nacido Vineyard for this wine. Once sipped, the balance between Key lime pie flavors, present but not overly brisk acidity, and a tad of bitterness emerges. Pair with cedar- planked salmon topped with mango salsa.
This has a delicate citrus character and a tangy, minerally texture. The ripe fruits are balanced by acidity.
Glimmers of flint and smoke rim the black cherry and berry fruit on the nose, coupled with earthy scents of tobacco and bramble. The medium-weight mouth offers more developed, oak-driven flavors of cocoa nib and roasted espresso bean while the crushed satin texture fills the mouth with delicate tannins that linger.
Earthy aromas lead to a smooth and ripe wine that has a farmyard character. It also has red fruits and rounded tannins that could age further. The Merlot has acidity and a soft, while full aftertaste.
Coming from the Alvarinho region of Monção in the far north of Portugal, this is a rich wine, its creamy apple character brought out beautifully by its tight, steely edge. This has style, ripe fruit, a green plum skin edge to it, finished with vibrant acidity.
Most everyone's first Bordeaux is back for another year, with fruity black-cherry aromas spiked with just a touch of vanilla and cedar. Juicy acidity keeps this crowd-pleaser lively through the lightly tannic finish. A good introduction to the genre.
Medium amber in color, this Muscat boasts scents of berries, pineapple and raisin to go with flavors of honey and spice. It's a lush, sweet style, with less complexity than some, but great texture and length.
From an estate vineyard only six miles from the ocean, this wine is steeped in coolness, from its sharply tuned pomegranate and tart cranberry to its mushroomy, damp earth tones and savory spice. Refined and light to medium bodied, it picks up a tight-grained, oaky, leathery intrigue on the finish.
The crispness of Aligoté is well expressed in this fruity, citrus and sliced apple flavored wine. It is bright, with a mineral texture along with some weight from aging on the lees until bottling. It's very ready to drink although it will soften and round out from 2015.
A bit on the sweet, soft side, with mashed raspberry, cherry and blackberry flavors seasoned with vanilla, but the peppery taste and firm tannins uplift this Zin and give it a frisson of pleasure.

Joan Simó had great success in 2005. This wine is excellent and the higher-end Les Eres is outstanding, so bottom line: buy Simó from 2005. Getting back to Sentius, a so-called “second” wine, it is dark, sexy, smooth and shows true Priorat accents of schist, coffee, cola and berry aromas. The flavors are flashy and fresh, with mammoth black cherry, plum and coffee virtually jumping from the glass. A very deep and balanced wine to drink now through 2013.
With five years bottle aging, this is a wine that shows great balance, along with a blossoming maturity. The wine is dry with brisk acidity, intense minerality and a taut profile, but rich and concentrated with apple flavor. It's likely to age for several more years.
This Bordeaux-style blend is 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, with the balance a mix of Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Malbec. It's a sophisticated blend that retains its youthful freshness.

Supple, graceful and polished, this wine would seem to have another decade of life ahead.
Made in a super Tuscan style, this blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah is lush and lovely. Lightly floral aromatics introduce notes of berry, plum and a whiff of leather. It xcellent balance and structure, with soft, yielding tannins. It was finished in 20% new oak.
Aged for a year in stainless-steel barrels, this wine is a combination of two vineyard blocks. The area planted to Old Wente 5 clone contributes zesty acidity and crisp apple; the V9 vineyard block is known for minerality. Acidity is balanced and the bouquet quite floral, with the palate devoted to brioche and golden honey.
Caiarossa is a blend of eight grape varieties (the largest percentages are of Sangiovese and Cabernet Franc), which displays loads of bright fruit and white cherry backed by tart acids and tight tannins. There's a sweet note as well but the wine needs another five years of cellar aging.
A fuller, more minty and deep Garnacha than Hughes' Lot 129. This has standup, standout aromas followed by deep berry fruit flavors. It has plenty of body but keeps its balance, and the finish is thick and strong. A little rugged but really good by regional standards.
J. Lohr dives into the dark side of Pinot Noir, presenting a deeply hued wine with black cherries, slate and yeast on the nose. Licorice and blackberry power the palate with sage as the prevailing herb, all balancing out well despite the relatively high alcohol content.

Juicy red plum and bright berries fill the palate, while accents of savory herbs and wild animal add depth to the nose. Balanced and approachable with a satiny structure and a medium-length finish. Drink now.

Showing youthful oak tones that still need time to integrate, this wine is a bit sour and ripe at the same time. Black cherry, tobacco, leather and spice aromas are nice, but the tannins are firm, and the wine shows a bright point of acidity on the close and a gritty, cooked-fruit finish.
This incredibly tasty wine seems to melt in the mouth. Classic aromas of cinnamon, black cherry and cedar becomes more chocolaty on the palate as layers of cocoa, dark plum and toasted baguette unfold. Its texture is so velvety that the fine-grained tannins seem to dissolve as you sip, while still providing a slight grip that counteracts the richness and full body. Tempting now, it will be best 2022–2032.
Smoky, sulfuric aromas put you on alert. This strange Catalonian blend of Garnacha Blanca, Albariño and Moscatel feels solid and centered, while salty papaya flavors are a touch bitter. A finish with little flavor but good texture close this out.
The aromas bring notes of jasmine, lime zest and honeysuckle. It drinks dry, with lightly concentrated fruit flavors that lead to a floral finish. It provides enjoyment but the concentration doesn't seem all there.

A note of honeyed nut hits the nose first, followed by touches of golden plum and apricot. This wine shows Viognier's seductive fleshiness, and it boasts lively acids that keep the palate feeling lifted and zesty.
Nana was probably a wonderful woman but this Zin is a little musky, closed off and chewy with a taste of cherry cordial and baked plum jam.

Richer scents of maple smoke and bacon fat integrate well into a sexy purple flower, blackberry and clove-laced black-cherry-syrup character on the nose of this wine, which includes 2% Viognier. A black-pepper-crusted beef quality shows once sipped alongside boysenberries, violets, lilacs, Sichuan peppercorn and even black tea.
Brambly aromas precede sour flavors of pie cherry and green strawberry. A sheering wine that's miserly even by Funky Llama's standards. The best that can be said about this tart Malbec is that it isn't overripe or sappy.
Lots of ripe, lush blackberry and cherry jam, mocha and cassis liqueur flavors in this full-bodied Cab. Tastes younger than it really is, with some brisk acids and firm tannins. Give it another 3–4 years in the cellar to let the parts continue to evolve.
A tough wine to like. It's bone dry, hard in tannins and tartly acidic, and not very fruity, with flavors just barely suggesting sour cherries. On the plus side is elegant construction.
Full and spicy from the get-go, with hints of clove vying with savory berry and leather. The optimum word to describe this wine is friendly, meaning it delivers ripeness, berry flavors and sweet, spicy accents that complete the package. Leans toward baked and sweet but keeps things properly framed.
Meandering streaks of mineral oil and petrol hint at the developing maturity of this otherwise sunny, tangerine-scented Riesling. Dry in style, with a lush, expansive mouthfeel, it's balanced by a crush of wet stones and bitter white-tea notes on the finish. It's an elegant, complex wine to enjoy now through at least 2020.
This opens with funky aromas that suggest farmyard, stewed fruit and worn leather. The dense palate is already evolved, showing raisin, fig, game and walnut that lead to a short, bitter finish.
Spicy red currant fruit comes up quickly, backed with the grape's signature accents of stem and earth. There's a residual flavor of slightly bitter tomato leaf.
Tight, textured and mineral, this wine just hints at the fruit to come. It is dark, brooding and concentrated, with black-plum flavors just beginning to shine through the dry texture. It needs aging, so drink from 2022.
This wine has traveled miles in the right direction compared to its early incarnations.

Finishes wavy and long; 50% Syrah along with Merlot, Cab and Carmenère.
Simple and lean, this opens with whiffs of Mediterranean herb, lead pencil and a whisper of blue flower. The short rather diluted palate shows raw sour cherry and a hint of dark spice alongside fleeting tannins.
Earthy aromas of raisin and plum are buried under heavy oak. This is 88% Cabernet Sauvignon and 12% Bouchet, and it feels raw, woody and resiny. Barrel-based aromas of vanilla and wood are front, center and dominant, while this remains highly barrel driven on the finish.
There's no oak on this simple Sauvignon Blanc. It's made in a softer style, which makes the apricot, orange and lime flavors taste riper than they really are.
From cool vineyards, this is an impressive, steely, crisp wine, mineral in texture, with tight fruit, fresh but always in tension.
This is a powerful, concentrated wine, just verging (but not quite passing) on overweight. That makes it rich and dense, full of black plum fruits and damson skins both giving a textured juiciness. The tannins, though, are still young and the wine needs plenty of time. Drink from 2018.
Ripe, rich black cherries and berries are accented by layers crushed stone on this elegant Cabernet Sauvignon. Fresh fruit concentrates the palate, but it's brightened by a jolt of acidity and fine, lingering tannins.

Winemaker: David Finlayson. The nose of this Viognier is fresh at the start, with vibrant notes of quince, melon and fynbos. The palate offers more weight and concentration, round and a bit flat in texture, with lush flavors of rich lemon, citrus peel and honeydew. It's an opulent style, ultimately, and is best enjoyed over the short term.

The light yet grippy texture is stunning.
Fruity, rich and honey-sweet, with decadent flavors of peach and pear jam, apricot, pineapple, green apple and vanilla, enhanced with sweet, smoky oak. There's a good spine of acidity for balance.
Right from the start this is clean, snappy and peppery, with an added touch of butter and honey. Lemon-lime flavors get a boost from fresh green herbs and white pepper, while the finish is spot-on. At one moment it's razor-sharp and cleansing, and then it opens up to offer citrus and mineral.

A lingering vein of dark char, spice and toast acts as a counterpoint to this wine's ripe, black-fruited character. The palate is rich and densely concentrated, kept taut by a frame of bold tannins. It's pleasant now but should develop smoky, savory complexities through 2023.

This is a dense and heavy take on the grape, but done with style, showing vanilla cookie, clove and deep anise spice atop the black cherry core. Gingerbread, red cinnamon and Christmas spice liven up the baked red-plum fruit of the palate, laced with rich oak flavorings. It's not a dainty wine, but it's certainly delicious.
There is a mere hint of fresh grapefruit on the nose but the palate follows with rounded, fresh but spice-edged mirabelle plums and more gentle citrus.

This single-vineyard blend includes Pinot Gris, Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc Musque, from a one-acre site in the Columbia Gorge AVA.

This attention-grabbing debut Chardonnay comes from a new sister winery to Roederer Estate in Mendocino County.

Rich and full in flavor, it's sleek in texture, but not too full-bodied.
Here's a fresh and cheerful Sangiovese-based wine that shows bright berry tones and soft spice nuances. It proves a very food-friendly wine that would pair with pasta, light meat dishes or rolled pork roast.
Curiously not as satisfying as the regular bottling (reviewed May 2000), the reserve sacrifices prettiness in search of power. Too much alcohol adds heat to the mouthfeel, and a vinegary nose distracts from the good fruit.

A very pleasant cherry-raspberry aroma and similarly fruity flavors bring a lot of appeal to this light-bodied and not very tannic wine. It's smooth and easy to drink, with no rough edges.
The Mendocino Ridge appellation, which is defined by elevation boundaries, borders Anderson Valley. This Pinot shows cool-climate crispness but also fog-free, ripe flavors of raspberries and cherries that are deep and impressive. With a thick, juvenile mouthfeel, the wine should develop interesting bottle complexities over the next five years.
Pozzan turns his attention to Zinfandel, with good results. The wine shows crisp acidity, rich tannins and brambly flavors of blackberries, cherries, milk chocolate, pepper, cloves and vanilla. So ripe, it tastes sweet, but this Zin is fundamentally dry.
If you've never tried Argentine Bonarda, Chakana is a good place to start. The nose offers the varietal's typical vulcanized rubber and dark-fruit aromas, while the palate is smooth and full of straightforward blackberry. Complicated it's not, but it is pleasant.
This is a liquorous wine, still with its youthful yellow-fruit and honey flavors that are cut with the dry botrytis core. The wine is rich and with a fine balance between the opulence and acidity. This is a wine to savor now, although it will also age further, certainly until 2023.
With this wine's slightly rustic character, it makes it a slightly harder Chardonnay to love, but interesting notes of spice add interest. The wine lacks some dimension but overall, offers pretty flavors and a food-friendly minerality.
Tight and textured, this is a mineral structured wine. Green fruits and acidity keep the wine fresh. The aftertaste is flatter, not bringing out enough fruit.

The second wine from Bodega Noemía de Patagonia is an unbridled winner in 2004. It's ripe and saturated, with a warm and spicy nose that blends just the right amount of rusticity with blackberry and plum. Quite a heavyweight with some raw oak, chocolate and mocha. Everything that fans of Argentine Malbec are looking for is on stage here. Imported by Vias Imports.
This wine is herbal and burns on the nose, where aromas of horseradish and tomato sauce don't really work. Flavors of raisin, brandy and black cherry are hardened by fierce tannins and a chemical-like dryness. Rubs like sandpaper on the palate.
Soft, light and fresh, this wine has attractive acidity as well as crisp, green flavors. There's a touch of vanilla which broadens it out. It's a solid, ready-to-drink wine.
Green apple appears amidst the more usual yellow and green-pear fruit and sets a fresh accent. The palate carries through on these vivid fruit notes and adds yeasty, savory spice: white pepper and arugula leaf create real interest. it's very refreshing and totally moreish.

Sprightly, fresh Mirabelle plum mixes with headier notes of rose to present a full-fruited but fresh array of juicy, sweet pear, more plum, mandarin and tangerine. The mouthfeel has that typical Gewurztraminer oily richness but also a welcome slick of 2014 acidity.
A good followup to the 2008. The cool '09 vintage has resulted in similarly dry citrus, lemongrass, gooseberry and mineral flavors. Lacks a bit of ripeness, which pushes it into green territory, with resulting acidity, but a pretty, clean sipper.
The Goldberg is an 8-acre vineyard, which produces dense and concentrated fruit from old vines. The wine has ripe, juicy fruit, intense tannins and a strong mineral character from the terroir. Barrique aging has added spice and vanilla and some smokiness, but the wood does not dominate the powerful fruit flavors.
This is a concentrated wine, with intense flavors of cherry and red currant. There's a tug of the earth by way of minerals and dried herbs. It's splendid acidity and firm tannins give it wonderful structure. It's an ager, so it should hold out at least through 2017.
After five-plus years, this is not a very likeable wine. It's heavy and harsh, with a jagged mouthfeel framing sweet-and-sour cherry LifeSaver candy flavors.
Clean and composed SB, with lemon-lime aromas that settle more toward lime. The palate is clean, with basic depth that allows for nice green apple and dry green-herb flavors to show themselves. A little weak on the back end, and very “liquid” due to medium concentration.
Surprisingly lightweight for a 2009 Bordeaux , here is a fresh, red berry-flavored wine with attractive fruit and a core of firm tannins. Drink now.
Smells gaseous and murky, like a compost pile. Rough and not well balanced in the mouth, with simple berry and burnt brown sugar flavors. Hot, heavy and barely acceptable.
Soft and simple, with flavors of melted blackberry, blueberry and raspberry jam, sprinkled with cocoa. Finishes sweet. Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon.
Black pepper, smoke, grilled bread and other robust flavors come to mind when sipping this big, distinctive and well-made wine. While ripe and full bodied, it's not overly fruity or jammy, and retains a sense of reserve and strength along with a very firm backbone of tannin. Best to drink after 2020.
Roasted, warm and rich, which is what we want from our Carmenère. The palate is dense and smacks down with mellow tannins, while flavors of roasted berry, smoked meats and herbs are textbook. There's some heat and weight to the wine, but overall it's big, solid and likable.
A real crowd pleaser for its sumptuous array of ripe berry and spice flavors. Wherever the grapes come from in California, they've given a delicious wine, soft and gentle, and filled with cherry, black raspberry, sweet licorice, exotic spice and sandalwood flavors.
Fruity and full-flavored, this quaffable Riesling brings a full share of peachy fruit, honeysuckle and English breakfast tea. The residual sugar is just over 1%, and the acids compensate, giving it good balance.
Recent ratings have been consistent for this pricey Malbec-Petit Verdot-Tannat blend. The nose is woody and the fruit seems baked, and along the route you encounter a cheesy, horsey quality. Thick on the palate, with good structure and buttery flavors of strawberry and raspberry. Doesn't bring it all together, but the parts have their virtues.
This wine is complex and deep in flavors, traditional in style and simply gorgeous to sip and savor. It's dry in style, good and tannic in texture, lightly spiced with cedar and cinnamon and grounded in concentrated raspberry and dark cherry flavors.
This vintage of the winery's Sauvignon Blanc doesn't reflect the tropicality that's started to define the region. It has more warmth to the nose than the grassy pungency common elsewhere, but the stronger differences are on the palate, with cooked apple, squeezed lemon and a brisk acidity, though not a particularly long finish. Altogether, this is a mellow, subdued wine.
Aromas of pear, apple, and whiffs of tropical fruit are followed by a tart lively palate full of rounded fruit flavors. It shows a light spritz and a lot of crispness.
This wine is dominated by new wood, which goes right through the big, dark fruit flavors and tannins. Very ripe cassis flavors are under this wood, waiting likely for many years before the wood flavors subside. This is very much in the modern, polished style of Mouton today, made even more pronounced by the heat of  the 2003 vintage. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates.
This is a well made, fruit and tannin wine. With delicious black currant fruits, juicy acidity and a supporting role of dry tannins, it has minerality, touches of wood aging and a more serious aftertaste, ready for aging. Drink from 2017.
Here's a big, tannic wine, with a structure that's matched by the rich fruits. It is solid and chunky, with an attractive, smoky, juicy character that balances the firm texture. Age for 3–4 years.
Give it air time and it'll give back floral raspberry and cherry aromas in front of a racy, forward-style palate that's got cherry and red plum flavors and integrated spice. Not overbearing; clean and dry on the finish. Atypical for a Carmenère-led prestige wine; it's more streamlined and red in character.
A full blast of oak and related aromas open this creamy, ripe wine. Plump on the palate but with just enough acidity to preserve balance, this rich, friendly wine features walnut, papaya and citrus flavors that finish woody, smooth and long. Drink now.
Hot and medicinal, with baked flavors of berries.
Here's a wine that just fills the mouth with good things. This wine revels in its richness, which is balanced by fresh acidity, keeping the wine crisp.
A finely integrated and ripe wine that is full of rich fruits and solid, dusty tannins. It has good concentration, sweet black fruits and great acidity. It will age well; drink from 2017.
Pure Pinot Noir, this has weight as well as intense acidity. It's a crisp wine, sourced from near Chablis, cool in texture while showing ripe red apples and quince fruitiness. Drink now.
Composed of 40% Viognier, 39% Chenin Blanc and 21% Grenache Blanc, there's an attractive round richness to this wine. A toasty character spices up the fresh pear, melon and orange rind flavors, with a nutty accent lingering on the finish.
Medium- to full-bodied, this sweet spätlese features lively aromas of green apple layered over scents of diesel oil. Pineapple flavors add citrusy brightness to the midpalate, finishing with milder notes of tangerine.
Lots of forward fruit flavor in this ripe Cabernet. It floods the mouth with blackberries, cherries and currants, with a smoky overlay of oak. Not particularly subtle, but it defines the modern style of Cabernet, and lots of people will love it.
Not a typical Crozes-Hermitage, Jaboulet's Domaine de Roure is a showcase for what the appellation is capable of. In this vintage, it's a full-bodied yet not overly structured wine, with a huge Syrah nose of meat, pepper, plum and baking spices and lingering espresso and black olives on the finish. Drink now–2020.
A distinct late-harvest character pervades this full-bodied Zin, which has very ripe aromas of raisins and prunes, and bold, dried-fruit flavors, too. The texture is smooth and the wine is soft and not very tannic.
Aromas of chewing gum and sulfuric grit lack fruit. This feels wiry and narrow, with hardly any body. Salty, briny apple and orange flavors finish hollow. Overall, this is just a light, quaffable, generic white wine.
This reserve-style wine primarily comes from Boushey Vineyard in the Yakima Valley. Aromas of mineral, wood spice, bacon fat, herb and red fruit are followed by sultry, soft flavors that display a lot of elegance.
Its dark color promises power, and this wine delivers a broad, chunky Shiraz, with perfumed fruit, dark tannins and a spicy wood structure. Solid concentration gives a wine that somehow manages to assimilate a Franco/Australian variety into a dry Portuguese structure.
Complete, aromatic and lively, with a tart, citrusy nose. Layered and precise, this beautifully focused effort sets sparkling acidity against toasty oak. The tart, cool-climate fruit flavors are concentrated and fresh.
This is a very good wine. Made from Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Petite Sirah and Syrah, from around the state, it's absolutely dry, rich in tannic structure, and complex, with cherry, berry, tobacco, cedar and spice flavors. An excellent and versatile food wine, at a great price.
Menthol, mint, sage, dark berry and rose aromas come with a balsamic note. Firm, fine-grained tannins support concentrated black cherry, crushed plum, mocha, vanilla and licorice flavors. Drink through 2022.
Old vines in this case means over 20 years old. The result is a wine that has richness and a delicious creamy texture as well as refreshing swathes of citrus acidity. It could even age, so drink now and until 2018.
Dark gold in color, this is a memorably luxurious and vivacious wine, tangy in grapefruit, burnt orange and cardamom. Layered and complex, it evolves as it opens to a lingering tease of butterscotch topped in nutmeg. It is an outstanding vision of an outstanding site, a wine for the ages.
Zins hardly get much bigger or bolder than this one. With very high alcohol, it's dry and full bodied, with a glyceriney mouthfeel to the blackberries, cola, mocha and peppery spices. Drink now.
This small estate, dedicated to white wines only, is part of the same stable as Château Haut-Brion itself. This superb wine is packed with ripe, sweet fruit, but equally importantly, shows intensity, layers of wood, a great citrus character and the acidity so typical of 2002. This is a long-term wine: drink in 10–15 years.
Attractive and fruity, this has red fruits at the fore. It is soft, round and balanced, with just the right amount of red currant acidity. Drink now.
Made from 88% Grenache and 12% Viognier, this lilting wine abounds with dry, fruity and floral characteristics. Salmon-peach in color, it has texture and the requisite refreshment offered by its barely ripe strawberry and peach swathes. Although it delivers enough acidity and bite to pair with food, it might be hard to wait that long.
Tastes heavy and soft, with syrupy black cherry and brown sugar flavors. There's some wintergreen in there, too, that provides a jarringly tart note. Doesn't seem like an ager, so drink up.
Riserva Colle Secco, made from the Montepulciano grape, opens with aromas of raw wood chips and sawdust. The palate is dominated by aggressive oak and espresso with hints of black fruit muffled in the background.
This is classic Dry Creek Zin—robust, heady, rich in tannins, spicy and insanely flavorful. Explodes with briary, brambly wild berries, mocha, tobacco, anise, dried pine needles and exotic sandalwood notes. Really delicious now, and should age well over the next 10 years, gradually mellowing and shedding fruit and tannins.
This is fruit-powered Riesling, finished dry but with a touch of residual sugar to soften the acids. Apple and Meyer lemon fruit flavors intermingle, sporting abundant, juicy natural acidity.
This is a ripe, spicy and full-bodied wine from the Robin group of producers created by Grand Moulin's Jean-Francois Renaud in Blaye. The wine has both structure and rich blackberry fruit. The tannins are dusty, spicy and with fine acidity to balance. Drink this fine wine from 2019.
Extra time in bottle has proved rewarding for this varietally pure, aromatic, even pungent wine. A complex bouquet yields rose petals, sweet spices, coffee and cedar, and flavors follow through a subtle, penetrating finish. The spicy, brambly berry fruit carries a hint of brine. Drink now through 2025.
Initial grassy aromas of hay and wheat usher in scents of peach, melon and saline water. This is a bit pulpy on the palate, but with cutting acidity. Melon, apple cider and nectarine flavors finish with friendly but nondescript white-fruit flavors.
Creamy notes pear crumble make for a most attractive nose. The palate follows with gentle softness and concentration, supported by bright, fresh acidity. The creamy notes continue alongside notes of green and red apple and fresh pear. There is a lot of substance and body, so have this alongside a meal, the finish is superclean.
On the lighter side of Cabernet, this estate-grown Wente reserve offers delicate herbal flavors intermingled with a taste of dark cherry. With the right balance between acidity and texture it'll hold up at the dinner table and provide ample body and finish.
Torrontes is something we've never seen from the Trumpeter line. And maybe that's good, seeing that this is oily in the mouth, with pithy, unusual flavors coming from all directions. It's a wine that doesn't stride along with ease.
It's almost absurd how good this $9 Tempranillo is. Full, clean, deep aromas of black fruits and licorice feed into an energetic yet generous palate with moderate richness. Flavors of black cherry, blackberry and pepper finish spicy but not pushy. What a deal!
Not an intense nose, but an attractive one with floral and fruity layers. There's chalk, peach and generous cream in the mouth, which beg for all kinds of cream or custard-based desserts. Imported by 5 Star Importers.
This popular Chardonnay gives you a generous burst of buttered nuts and toast, the flavors many consumers want in their Chardonnays. Not much going on in the fruit department—just clean, tart green apples, with a sharp, acidic edge.
This Riserva opens with a lean, compact color and vinous aromas of forest berry and cherry. There's crisp acidity here that will pair perfectly with foods that have a fatty element such as ricotta-filled pasta or butter chicken.
Rich grape and blackberry flavors in a slightly sweet style make this generous and smooth. Full bodied, it has a welcome touch of tannin to keep it appetizing.
Green beans and grapefruit mark the nose; nectarine, pineapple and beans appear on the palate. At just 12.6% abv, it's reasonably plump and a bit sweet-tasting, making for a slightly disjointed package.
A 50-50 blend of Ciliegiolo and Sangiovese, this opens with aromas of blackberry extract, espresso, tilled soil and a balsamic note. The palate offers dried black cherries accented with mint, menthol and licorice alongside drying, woody tannins. Drink before 2018 to capture what remains of the fruit.
Whiffs of freshly cut mint and tarragon are pleasant against a backdrop of lean red fruit on the nose and palate of this Bordeaux blend, but lurking traces of underripe fruit and tomato leaf distract.
Aromas of violet, earth, plum and spiced berry lead the nose. The palate delivers ripe black cherry, white pepper and clove alongside assertive tannins. Drink 2016–2022.
Very delicious, with the silky mouthfeel you want in a fine Pinot Noir. The flavors are cool-climate crisp, with raspberries, cherries and cola, balanced with subtle herbs and tobacco. Feels a bit direct and jammy in the mouth for development. Drink now.
Tart, almost sour, in gooseberry and pyrazine aromas and flavors, and bone dry, with crisp, citrusy acidity. Finely structured and dry, but those feline tastes are pretty strong.
Smooth and spicy, this wine explodes in layers of cinnamon and clove dusted in sugary plum and black cherry, a powerful weight and degree of ripeness at its core. The finish is soft and lengthy in vanilla oak.
Toasty, oaky aromas of graphite, pepper, barrel char and black fruits properly announce a palate of chewy tannins and several layers of blackberry, cassis, barrel-spice, toast and chocolate flavors. Chocolaty depth on the finish only adds to the package. Drink through 2030.
Bright-pink in hue, this has crisp acidity and enduring aromas of grapefruit, raspberry, wild fruit and chopped herb. There's even a touch of bitter almond on the bubbly close.
Viognier (10%) announces itself first with aromas of flowers and orange peel that are followed by smoke, leather and spice on a wine that has yet to fully reveal itself. The cranberry and cherry flavors are full in feel, tapering toward the finish.
This leads with plum, vanilla, barrel spice and herb aromas. The palate is soft and velvety, keeping the vineyard's often burly tannins well in check and providing a lot of textural appeal. Cocoa notes linger on the finish, delivering a yum factor that is hard to ignore.
This is a ripe and full-bodied; it benefitted from the warm vintage, offering rich yellow-fruit flavors to go with its touches of toast and sweet herb. On the finish, acidity and minerality come forward to suggest its aging potential.
A better effort than in previous years. This vintage has a tangy personality and no tricks up its sleeve. The pineapple and citrus flavors are solid and the finish holds onto the Verdejo's citrusy profile. Steady and clean all the way through.
Straightforward and a touch sharp, with cherry, earth and leather aromas. Red plum, pie cherry and vanilla flavors carry the palate toward a peppery, lean finish. Fresh enough but not very loving.
Caressed in forested earthiness, this wine is both crisp in acidity and creamy in baked apple and crème brûlée, a layering of lemon meringue on top. It is integrated and balanced up until the finish, where a firm grip of oak takes hold.
This hearty, rich bottling needs time to breathe, yielding fragrant black cherry, black currant, cola and roasted fennel aromas as it opens. It's soft and rounded on the palate, its blackberry, cocoa, crushed herb and pepper flavors blanketed in silky tannins.
Very pretty and soft upon entry, with tangy boysenberry fruit, this young Syrah is sharply defined and buoyed by sharp acids. Lightly floral and still a bit yeasty, it offers scents of brioche, orange blossom and sweet grape candy. An elegant, feminine Syrah.
Light, clear and varietal, this ripe, full-bodied wine is balanced by a seasoning of forest floor, Christmas spice and cranberry-orange. The fruit is elusive against the toasty oak and integrated tannin.
You could drink this easy Moscato with fish, chicken, even pork, but it's sweet enough to classify as a dessert wine. It shows flavors of honey, apricots, tangerines and limes.
Campfire and hickory aromas dominate the nose on this superficial Carmenère that's round in the mouth but also acidic and showing little structure or stuffing. Flavors of black fruits, herbal notes and wood finish rubbery in feel then bitter in taste.
A wide-open, creamy wine, with flavors of ripe apples. It is round, generous, full-bodied, only just touched by minerality and edged with wood. Drink over the next 2–3 years.
Fruit for this crisp and mineral-rich white wine comes from 80-year-old bush-like vines and one of the most extreme viticulture spots on the planet (950 meters in altitude on the volcano). It is rich with exotic fruit, delicate floral and peach lollipop notes, and a firm, compact structure. Imported by Vino Bravo.
Our unanimous favorite of the tasting, La Prima comes from the oldest vines on the property, and is a blend of 90% Sangiovese, 5% Canaiolo and 5% Colorino aged in barriques. Dark color, with black plums and hints of violets on the nose, the oak is understated, allowing the blackberry, plum and floral notes to shine through. Finishes rich, chewy and long.
While the vintage of 1993 was certainly not the finest in Champagne, it can still hold its head high. This is mature—certainly not old—a fine wine, with toast and almond flavors and swathes of acidity to keep it lively and bright. It's probably not suited for further aging, but it is a great wine to drink now.
Honey is the key word to describe the nose and flavor of this extremely aromatic and just slightly sweet wine, which also offers notes of honeysuckle and honeydew. Winemakers often turn the grape Symphony (a cross of Muscat of Alexandria and Grenache Gris) into a sweet, dessert-style wine, but this shows how good it can be in a drier version.
Slightly rough and leathery on first take, and a little soupy as well. Airing clears things up, leaving a steady, mildly stewed wine with roasted plum and blackberry flavors. Ripe, sweet and generous, with a controlled finish that properly reflects the wine's flavors and mouthfeel.
More plush on the palate than the 1990, with sweet fruit flavors and a dusty overlay of bread flour. At its peak now.
Peach, clove-spiked Anjou pear, orange rind and honeysuckle fill the overall character of this fresh white. Medium weight with a good toasty richness that lingers through the finish. Drink now.
This medium-bodied wine has a classic aroma of cherries, tea and spice, plus a rich mouthfeel, deep flavors and good balance. It's nicely made and easy to enjoy.
Vanilla, tobacco and anise flavors quickly overwhelm the fruit; perhaps the wine just needs to breathe longer. At first taste, it quickly turns tannic and very drying; the fruit is buried and the oak flavors are still a bit jarring and disjointed.
This is a ripe wood-aged wine that has a smooth rich texture. It is rounded with dominant toastiness as well as perfumed fruit. The wine has a cool edge that comes from the influence of the Atlantic while bringing out a ripe apple and apricot character. Drink this wine now.
Pretty tannic, and extremely well-oaked. Char, vanilla and smoke dominate the opening aroma, only gradually revealing underlying cassis flavors. In the mouth, the wine is tannic and young, but the solid core of cherry-berry suggests aging until 2008.
Smells intriguing, with minerally, corn-oil scents dominating, but graced by hints of honeyed orange sections. In the mouth, it's firmly built without being hard—like a sharp-edged table that's been padded at the corners. Picks up a leafy note on the finish, but it's mostly minerally.
Bone dry and tannic, with a sour bite of acidity. It's a pretty fierce Cab, despite some decent blackberry flavors.
Aromas of mature dark-skinned fruit, espresso, baked plum and grilled porcini lead the nose. The tight, taut palate delivers fleshy Morello cherry, blackberry clove and licorice while close-grained tannins leave an assertive, tongue drying finish.
Soft fruit notes, peach and mineral are very characteristic of the Soave Classico zone in northern Italy. Besides that bright fruitiness, this wine follows through to the palate with mild richness and creaminess.
Erath's white wines are crisp and clean, if a bit simple. Light fruit flavors suggest apple more than pear, set against tart acids. This is a lean style, all stainless, perfectly drinkable but undistinguished.
This red blend, made of 65% Syrah, 28% Mourvèdre and 7% Tannat is a fresh and fruity wine that's ready to drink now. Dark berries and a touch of sweet oak flesh out the mouth, with a clean and refreshing finish.
Peach and stony aromatic notes are good but common. This has a fresh simple plump feel and nice but basic melon and lime flavors. A clean finish with firm acidity keeps this chugging along until the final whistle.
“Cocina” means “the kitchen” in Spanish, and this blend of Malbec, Bonarda and Syrah is definitely a kitchen-sink type of wine. It's stout, a bit reduced and tinny at first, but with air it turns into a nice, simple chunkster with plump baked-fruit flavors and a soft but structured chocolaty finish. Drink now.
Lots of rich, ripe black currants in this chunky wine, with other notes of leather, dark chocolate and pepper. But it has a dry, tannic bitterness to it. May be a function of youth, and could blossom unexpectedly one of these days.
Pale yellow in color, this Gewürz has aromas of ripe apple, Asian pear and canteloupe complemented by flavors of fresh peach and light ginger spice. A round, somewhat fat mouthfeel followed by a crisp and peppery finish closes the wine nicely.
From a small vineyard in St. Helena comes this ripe young wine, a Cab Franc-based Bordeaux blend. It's soft and forward, with cherry, red currant, licorice, chocolate and cedar flavors that show Napa tannins at their smooth, ripe best. It's a little tight now, so give it a few years.
Exuberant in fruit and oak, this Cabernet shows that the Happy Canyon appellation can ripen grapes. It's rich in blackberries and black cherries that taste baked into a pie, alongside buttery toast. Very delicious, but the next step is to build in layers of complexity with aging.
Opens with straightforward aromas of strawberry and cotton candy, giving way to peach and apple on the (slightly watery) palate. The unobtrusive acidity and off-dry style of this wine make it a good partner for sweeter dishes, like calamari in a candied citrus sauce. Drink now.
A year's wood aging has left its mark on this wine in the form of burnt smokiness. However, the fruit is rich and full-bodied giving the promise that the wine will smooth out its rough edges. There already is a fine juiciness at the end that comes with great acidity.
Any winemaker will tell you how difficult it is to make Pinot Noir in large volumes, so this is a notable achievement. Delicate herb and cherry aromas pick up vanilla shadings on the palate, then finish with a silky texture and a hint of tomato leaf. 10,000 cases imported.
Soft and flat in texture with a toffee character and a touch of spice. It tastes old before its time.
Firmly tannic and structured this is a young wine that will need time to soften. It has the foursquare character that is often found in Nuits Saint-Georges. The fruit weight is there, promising a ripe red-fruit future. The wine should be ready from 2020.
The top red from Chocapalha, this comes from a single parcel. It has concentrated tannins, along with the minty flavors that come from new wood. Balancing that combination are the rich fruits: blackberry, damson along with a touch of licorice. It's a powerful wine that needs aging. Drink from 2018.
Suavia's base Soave Classico opens with an initial hint of sulphur but then finds purity in the form of peach, honey and herbal aromas. In fact, the wine shows very nice fruit characteristics on the close.
Big, stacked, deep and dark Malbec. The nose is rich, spicy and black in character, while the palate is bulky and shows generous blackberry, dark plum and chocolate flavors. Holds steady on the finish as it delivers muscle as well as some complexity. Well-made wine for the money.
Zippy lemongrass and white grapefruit flavors penetrate this vibrant but richly mouth-filling Spätlese. It's juicy, forward and accessible yet elegant, finishing with reverberating lime and lemon-zest astringency. Drink now through 2020.
Slightly buttery aromas and definitely fruity flavors shape this medium-bodied, barrel-fermented wine into crowd-pleasing form. The ripe peach, cherry and apricot flavors are delicious, the texture is smooth and the finish crisp and floral.
An eiswein that's different—and affordable. Made from Gewürz, it boasts aromas and flavors of caramel or butterscotch, maple syrup and caramelized peaches. It is sweet, without the crispness of a Riesling eiswein, but enjoyable nonetheless. Drink it over the near term.
Informal and light, this fresh wine made from the Verdeca grape opens with easy aromas of citrus, honey and peach. It shows a bitter almond flavor in the mouth.
This bold, ripe wine is full of tannins as well as great fruit. Juicy with black currant flavors, smoky from wood aging and rich with tannins, it's finely structured and ready to mature gently. Drink from 2021.
This is a generous and fruity wine that has soft tannins. It is dominated by bright acidity, black-currant fruits and a light structure. With its fresh character, it will be ready soon, so drink from 2018.
The second wine of Château Coussin, owned by the Sumeire family, is from a parcel of vines in the main vineyard. It gives a rounded wine, soft, red fruited, crisp and clean. A delicious aperitif style.
Sprightly lime and peach aromas mix with seared orange rind and hints of white flowers on the nose of this bottling. The riper aromas tighten up on the sip, where tart green apples cut the suave nectarine-flesh flavors as white peach slowly emerges.
From the village of Epineuil, north of Chablis, comes this lightweight red with attractive fresh fruits, but a curious petrol aroma. It is soft and light, although there is a hint of dry tannins. Screwcap.
Quite sharp and reticent, with piercing, peppery aromas and flavors as well as plenty of searing acidity. Not an offensive or crazy wine, but too sour, lean and green to rate higher.
Foresty whiffs of pine needles meld with ripe yellow peach and cherry notes on the nose of this powerful, dry Riesling. It's full-bodied in style, with a rich, textured creaminess that's honed by a steely minerality that shines on the finish.
High alcohol gives this Bordeaux-Rhône blend a sweet, hot mouthfeel, while overripe fruit suggests raisins and prunes. Still, it's a sound wine that will find plenty of admirers. Ready now.
The merest touch of lemon appears on the nose. The palate is equally reticent, only gradually revealing a touch of orange blossom and apple peel around a very lemony, bright, linear core. This has concentration but no heaviness, there is depth and toned muscle. The finish is dry and alluring, focusing on that lemon purity with a lovely earthy edge of apple peel. Drink 2019–2030.
This blend of Sangiovese and Merlot starts with aromas of espresso, toasted oak and plum. The palate offers one-dimensional plum and cherry with oak notes alongside firm tannins and uplifting acidity.
The most complete and compelling of Diamond Creek's trio of '02s, combining the opulent accessibility of Gravelly Meadow with the power and authority of Volcanic Hill. The aromas of cassis, red currants, cedar, tobacco and cigar box lead to massively packed Cabernet flavors wrapped in huge, dusty tannins. The wine is so balanced, so distinguished and complete. Decant now if you must drink it, but it should start to mellow by 2008, and then peak and hold through 2015 at least.
This is a juicy, ripe style of Vinho Verde that's soft, clean and refreshing. It's a summer-evening wine, light and bright. Screwcap.
From its privileged position right next to the grand cru of La Tâche, Aux Malconsorts has produced a heady, perfumed wine, relatively delicate, relying on its succulent red fruits to give body. It is on the sweet side of Pinot Noir, jammy with red berry flavors, and already delicious.
The color of this blend of 76% Chardonnay and 24% Pinot Noir is a rich, golden pink. It's medium-bodied and rich in toast, strawberry and lime flavors that finish a little sweet. The acidity is fabulous. Might develop bottle notes over the years, but why bother. It's a beautiful bubbly to drink now.
This wine's crushed herb, mineral and blackberry aromas lead to intensely rich, full-bodied black fruit and smoked meat flavors. It's big and bold and ready for steak.
The oak influence currently sits high on this blend of 50% Merlot, 35% Syrah and 15% Cabernet Sauvignon, offering notes of char, molten caramel, tea and smoky wood. It feels extracted, with easy acids and big, mouth-clasping tannins. Cedar and dried herb accents add interest to the finish.
This wine has weight and considerable richness. Spice and an attractive perfume meld with the blackberry fruits and juicy acidity. The Castelão grape is at home in this region, which shows in the sense of terroir in this bold wine. Drink now.
A solid wine in every respect; there's nothing to complain about here. Acidity is lively, and fruit runs the crisp, cool spectrum of black cherry, raspberry, even a citric edge. Black pepper and clay hints complete the picture. 310 cases produced. Imported by American Estates Wines, Inc.
This is a candied Pinot with flavors of pink bubblegum, raspberries and strawberries. Give it some time in the glass and drink up.
Aromas of graphite, chocolate, olive, herbs and berry fruits open this cool-climate Syrah. Laser-beam acidity comes on like gangbusters, while those sharp acids create racy, almost tart flavors of currant and huckleberry. The finish is more flashy and racy than generous and tasty, and thus crispness is the defining character of this wine.
Alluring scents of wisteria and citrus blossom drift out of the glass. On the palate, fresh acidity brightens green apple, white peach and nectarine while an elegant mousse lends finesse. It has a crisp lingering finish.
Made entirely with Sangiovese, this opens with aromas of mature dark-skinned berry, violet and a whiff of baking spice. On the bright silky palate, notes of pipe tobacco, chopped herb and a hint of game add depth to the red-berry core.
This distinctive bottling, which includes a percentage of juice from 25-year-old vines, leans toward the spicy/herbal side of Oregon Pinot Noir. Whiffs of herb and leaf fade into light, lingering pale red fruits—watermelon and strawberry.
Grassy aromas of field flower and dandelions are backed by discreet tones of citrus and passionfruit. This is a very good and easygoing cocktail wine. It's thin, simple and fresh on the close.
With fresh green-apple aromas, and juicy apple and citrus flavors, this is a lively, crisp and well-balanced wine. Instead of going for overt oaky, buttery flavors and a fat mouthfeel, it stays nicely lean and refreshing, even with relatively full body.
While the winery's regular 2010 Diamond Mountain Cab is a barrel selection, this Estate Vineyard selection consists of “only the darkest, most extracted lots,” from the winery's various vineyards, according to the winemaker. That's exactly what you get, an inky wine, it's huge on the palate with blackberries, currants and dark chocolate, augmented by plenty of new French oak. It is absolutely delicious now, but the tannin structure guarantees to develop for 10–20 years.
This Chenin seems to have an older soul than its peers, with mature notes of honeyed almond and sweet spice that infiltrate the Anjou pear and hard peach flavors. Citrus pith adds a touch of bitterness to the otherwise toasty, sweet spice-infused finish.
Smoke, earth and bramble tones meander amidst tart stone fruit and tangerine flavors in this bristling kabinett. Off dry in style, it's juicy and effortlessly quaffable, yet subtly nuanced with lingering hints of blossom, saffron and herb.
This is old vine Lemberger, one of the first red grapes to be widely planted in eastern Washington. It comes from a 1979 planting at the Red Willow vineyard. Raspberry and cherry fruit flavors dominate, pretty and pure, but lacking in depth. Some Lemberger can approach the style of Dry Creek Zinfandel; this is more of a simple red quaffer.
The other realm of the coin from Brown Ranch, Toyon is leaner and lighter, its color even subdued, a study in wild strawberry and layered floral highlights, oak and cardamom spice. It bristles with acidity, pleasant to sip on its own or with bacon-wrapped figs.

This is a beautiful older Riesling that continues to have aging potential. It's rich, full of white currant, walnut, exotic spice and perfume. It still has the intense acidity of the Sunogeln vineyard that gives structure to the wine. It's ready to drink, but put a bottle away until 2018.
This hot vintage Sangiovese plays an even game in terms of elegance and harmony. You need to give it some time before the cherry and vanilla nuances come to full force. The wine also builds on the palate thanks to its natural structure and persistence.

This is a young wine with a lean texture and stalky fruit from a Chablis-based producer. It feels cool with its acidity and red-currant fruits. Drink now.

Quiet notes of smoked meat, flowers and toast lead on the nose of this blend of 60% Petit Verdot and 40% Syrah. Traces of mint and blackberry fill in the backdrop. This has a lush, alluring mouthfeel, but the midpalate needs a few years to gain weight.
Spicy and tough, this is a chewy, dark and tannic wine with strong flavors of black cherry fruit wrapped in thick tannins that taste of green tea and compost. It needs some softening—either bottle age or decanting—and then the rough edges should soften up and the very pretty cherry/berry fruit come front and center.
Roasted and rubbery, this features potent leather and compost aromas that settle with airing. Angular, aggressive and full of power and lemony oak, it also has raw wood and heavily toasted black-fruit flavors. Long, peppery and choppy, it's powerful and stomping. Best to hold this for 3–5 years before drinking, when it should emerge as a better, more approachable wine.
A huge wine, explosive in ripe fruit, elaborated with rich oak and wrapped into smooth, sweet tannins. Made from vineyards throughout the county, it dazzles with a complex of blackberry jam, mocha, date, bacon and smoky sandalwood flavors. Really impressive, especially at this price. Drink Now–2015.

94-96 Barrel sample. There is great power here, solid, dark and firm, showing muscularity, sinewy tannins and smoky intensity.
Dark cherry, raspberry, mineral and black pepper aromas start this value-driven Priorat on its way. The palate features high-toned, borderline tart black cherry and plum flavors, while the finish shows a bit of resiny oak that translates into spice and vanilla. A reasonable wine; juicy but not very rich.
An organic wine that is rough and oily on the nose and tannic and choppy in the mouth. It's a hard, wine with sweaty, sharp scents and too much black olive and funk. Not a disaster but it requires an awful lot from the buyer.
Pretty smooth and supple, this is a very soft, high thread-count wine that glides across the palate. It carries very ripe flavors of cherries and cocoa, with a finish that's almost sweet.
A tutti-frutti nose leans toward candied cherry and red plum, while the palate is lean, a touch shrill and tastes of lightly herbal red fruits. Nothing heavy or weighty here; it's a simple, perfectly good everyday Rioja with a hint of oak.
A rich but well balanced wine, this features ripe flavors and integrated tannins. A juicy black-currant note sits with the dusty structure, with fragrant acidity on the finish. The Château Sainte-Barbe is at the end of the promontory that lies between the Dordogne and Garonne Rivers just before they meet.
Possesses deep flavors of currants and blackberries, and yet you still have to wonder why it merits bottling on its own. It's bone-dry and tannic, and its austerity is a challenge. —S.H.
Floral aromas and flavors mingle in a sweet, slightly soapy midpalate. The fruit is nondescript; what is most noticeable are the brown, sweet spices.
This rare blend of Cabernet, Syrah, Petit Verdot and Touriga Nacional works surprisingly well, emphasizing tannic structure rather than fruit. The acidity of the Cab is what keeps it from being heavy, while the dense color and herbal flavors show its southern warmth and richness. Dried plums and fresh acidity to finish.
Wildflower and ripe apple aromas lead the nose while the palate offers mature pear fruit and fennel touches. A pleasant bitter almond note signals the close.

Lovely aromas, flavors and a fine mouthfeel define this rare item—a real Pinot Noir value. Appealing black cherry, earth, and tarragon aromas and flavors keep the taster interested, suggesting a broad range of food pairings, from salmon to lamb. It even offers decent body and length, almost unheard of in this price range.
The nose includes rubbery whiffs of berry, cherry and leather. On the palate, it feels solid but tomatoey, with zesty red-fruit acidity and flavors of red plum, herb, tobacco and spice. It turns more charred and peppery on the finish.
This almost pure Cab (just 2% Malbec) is almost midnight black in color. Fragrant with strong barrel scents of toast and char; the fruit has a spicy, citrusy lift to it that keeps the thick tannins from weighing it down. The big tannins and powerful, smoky notes do not overpower the rather delicate fruit; it all works together in a harmonious balance.
This is a rich and deeply oak-driven expression of Brunello with layers of spice and smoke that sit heavy over ripe fruit aromas of plum, prune and black currant. The texture is smooth and rich and the tannins are soft.

A simple, fresh style of wine, with attractive white currant flavors and good acidity. This Charles Lafitte brand describes itself as the successor to the George Goulet label, whose wines are now made elsewhere. Imported by Vranken America.
The most depth and weight of the lineup; black cherry and blackberry fruit holds down a solid, sweet center. The tannins are ripe and full, and the wine has an appealing roundness.
Sweet and savory aromas of hickory, BBQ and plum jam are nice, while the body is structured and full. The flavors follow the nose, meaning there's a savory, roasted quality to the wine but also jammy raspberry fruit notes. Chewy and a bit marinated, but it's quite good for the price.
A fine, well-developed wine that's dry and rich. It has weight and power, with a concentrated apple flavor and the beginnings of a mature character. Drink now, or give the wine a few more months.
From a vintage known for its readily-approachable wines, this grand cru Saint-Emilion shows surprising structure. Some toasty oak frames delicate black-cherry fruit. Black tea notes on the finish carry more tannins than the fruit can handle in the long run, so catch this one soon before it heads south.
Aromas of dried black fruit, violet and a whiff of grilled herb lead the nose. The palate offers crushed black cherry, vanilla, mocha and baking spice alongside firm but rather astringent tannins.
Muted aromatically, the wine is still generous in bright red fruit flavors, mostly strawberry-rhubarb and savory pomegranate, with accompanying layers of allspice. On the midpalate is the suggestion of vanilla before the finish delves into herbal, slightly sour territory.
This affordably priced Pinot Noir is part of the winery's popular Evolution series. It's smooth and forward, with pretty red fruit supported by juicy orange flavor. It has the tannin and stuffing to work well with roast poultry or as a stand-alone fireside sipping wine.

Dry, crisp and silky, it shows complex raspberry jam, buttered cinnamon toast and sandalwood flavors. It provides great satisfaction, at a fair price.
This is the winery's basic Cabernet, a blend of five vineyards on the mountain. It's a smooth, elegant, classic mountain Cab, that's dry and tannic, with delicious blackberry, currant and sweet-smoky oak flavors. It's right up there with Von Strasser's vineyard-designated wines that cost nearly twice as much, which makes it a great value.
This 100% varietal wine is lightly aromatic with notes of toast, spice and apple. The oak aging (20% new French) helps provide a sense of roundness but the fruit concentration doesn't seem to stand up to it.
Hefty, spicy aromas like black pepper, cardamom and wood smoke are followed by ripe, almost thick sensations of blackberry, blueberry and dried black fig. The mouthfeel of this wine is broad and soothing, the body extra full, and the finish lingers nicely.
Browning and maturing, but still showing a ton of life and kick. This traditional-style wine is mildly roasted on the nose, with touches of leather, latex and other firm aromas. The palate is nice, with dry raspberry and cherry flavors finishing with power and length. Solid and respectable, but not something you'd label as special. Drink now–2014.
Made from a blend of Falanghina, Biancolella and Pepella, it conveys aromas of honeysuckle, chamomile and exotic fruit punctuated with sage and mint. The linear palate offers citrus, grapefruit and pineapple alongside fresh acidity.
Tight as nails on the nose before it explodes on the palate in a cacophony of cherry, cassis, black plum, tobacco and chocolate. It's like the best cigar and a great red wine rolled into one. Yes, the tannins are hammering and yes, the acidity is forward. But that only means this brilliant Brunello should age for 15 years without batting an eyelash. Imported by Folio
The spice of this wine shows most. Add that to its good acidity and lively texture, and the wine will be delicious and rounded in a few months time. Drink from late 2017.
Decadent aromas of warmed chocolate and hazelnut coffee lead onto the pliant palate. Chalky tannins keep the vanilla-tinged finish grounded.
Lightly mauve in color, this rosé blend of 51% Syrah, 21% Grenache and 28% Mourvèdre shows ripe watermelon, bubblegum and strawberry on the juicy nose. The palate is quite restrained for such a ripe nose and deep color, but ripe plums emerge alongside graphite minerality and a pithy grip.
This bold red made from Argaman—a cross between Souzão and Carignan—offers upfront notes of boysenberry and black plum, accented by hints of bark and spiced chocolate. It's inky and dark, but with a good acidic cut that keeps the finish fresh and the wine approachable now.

With a soft, velvety mouthfeel, this bi-county Cabernet offers lush blackberry, blueberry, chocolate and spice flavors that are gently touched by smoky oak. This earns extra points for elegance and sipability.
Spicy, toasted coconut scents reflect barrel fermentation. The rather deep straw color suggests a wine that is maturing quickly. Pleasant drinking, but don't wait.
An unusual blend dominated by Cabernet Franc and Merlot, with only ten percent Cabernet Sauvignon. Very dark, rich and fruity, with cassis, blackcurrant, anise and herb flavors that are wrapped in big, sturdy tannins. Too young to drink now, unless it's with an enormous dish like braised short ribs, but best left for four or five years.
Grown primarily in Chile these days, Carmenère can be akin to Merlot, though this version has the herbal qualities of a Cab Franc and is otherwise quite oaky.
A strongly minerally wine, the 2005 Maria v. O. boasts perfumes of heating oil and smoke, while the flavors are of apple, pear and citrus, all wrapped in a petrolly shroud. Yet for all that, it also features sweetness balanced by lime-like acid and a clean, refreshing finish. Drink now–2015.
The Chardonnay in this blend was fermented and aged in wood and then combined with crisp Arinto fermented in tank. The result is a lightly oaked wine that has yellow fruits as well as crisper citrus. It is a finely made, ripe wine that will be ready to drink from the end of 2016.
This wine shows ample weight and concentration for a rosé. Bold, berry-scented aromas lead into similar flavors on the palate, joined by a hint of white chocolate. The texture is silky, lingering gently on the long finish. Drink up over the next few months.
A hard wine to like, although it's clean and without technical flaws. Tastes very oaky now, with hard grapeskin and oak tannins giving an astringency to the superripe blackberry and cherry jelly flavors.
Firm tannins show the structure and density of this wine. Dark plum fruits give a concentrated character that is cut by red-cherry acidity. Big and bold, this ripe while fresh wine needs to age. Drink from 2017.
Lively, with brisk lime and herb aromas opening into a mouthful of tart grapefruit flavors. Shows a nice mouthfeel and a long finish with a crisp citrus tang and a slight mineral note. This zinger is right up there with the best in this style from New Zealand.
A cool Cabernet, fresh rather than structured. It's obvious the wine has been worked hard to get out the red fruit flavors and tannins, and it doesn't quite work. It feels extracted with bitterness as well as a more attractive fruitiness.
The wine comes from the western end of the Côtes de Provence, from vines at the foot of the massive Aurelien mountain. It is light colored, but has plenty of ripe red fruits that are crisp, bright and direct. This is a delicious, refreshing wine. Drink now.

A subdued nose has the gentle lift of lemon oil and fresh lemon zest. The palate confirms all of this rich freshness, which streams with great direction across the palate. This is taut and concentrated, with a poised freshness and structure that holds very rich lemon and tangy citrus at its core. There is so much drive and direction. The lovely long finish is reminiscent of Seville orange and pink grapefruit.
Hard, earthy aromas are o.k., while the palate has a tough, clipped mouthfeel along with snappy, narrow raspberry flavors. Shows pop, heat, pepper and mild bitterness on the finish. Standard and simple; 40% Malbec with 30% each Merlot and Cab Sauvignon.
With its black pepper aromas and dry, hard tannins that make the mouth pucker, this is an atypical Rutherford Cabernet. But it's a very good, even a noble one. As tough as it is, it possesses a rich core of black currant that lasts through a long finish. Unusual and distinctive, it should hold its own for a decade.
From winemaker John Kane, who worked for years with Kent Rosenblum, this wine is dense and decadently rich and concentrated, a jammy, thick flavor explosion of soy sauce, black olive and Dr. Pepper cola. Smooth on the palate, it threatens to overpower in ripeness before pulling back just enough to show complexity.
This is already a delicious wine. With its soft tannins, generous red fruits and rounded texture, it is showing a warm and ripe character. The tannic texture and touch of smokiness will allow it to age for the medium-term. Drink from 2016.
There are some pretty features to this wine, namely the lovely tannins and rich fruit, but it's just too soft and sweet. Tastes like blackberry jam, with extra white sugar spinkled on top.
This is a low-intensity sparkler made with the Prosecco grape that offers measured aromas of stone fruit and citrus. Despite a lean, watery structure, it does have vibrant crispness and a sweet, fruity finish.
This is black as night, concentrated and shows aromas of asphalt, lemon peel and blackberry. The palate is round and soft, with mellow tannins. The flavor profile is very ripe and focuses on prune and blackberry, while the finish is loamy in feel, with a licorice hint.
Chuck Ortman is one of the few to source grapes from this esteemed vineyard. The '04 is a giant step ahead of the '03, suggesting an increasing mastery of the grapes. This inky dark wine is hugely ripe, with red and black fruit-filled pastry flavors, yet dry, silky and balanced. Should develop additional complexities by 2008.
Here's a succulent and chewy red wine (“a wine for pizza”) with the prerequisite spice, blackberry aromas and natural acidity to pair with cooked tomato, oregano or stringy mozzarella. The wine is soft, smooth and easy in the mouth.
Perbruno is a beautiful Syrah from central Tuscany that showcases loads of elegant spice and cinnamon backed by blueberry, cherry and sophisticated oak renderings. Pair this wine with succulent steak and green pepper cream sauce.
While this smells slightly briny and gritty, there's controlled energy and a sense of quality to the palate. Peppery, dry flavors of apple and peach are lasting on a stone-fruity-heavy finish.
Silhouette typically is held back a little longer than most Chards, which seems to soften it slightly. Still, the '03 is as fresh and pure in fruit as a young wine. It brims with ripe green apple butter, pineapple custard, butterscotch and spicy rum flavors that are well-oaked, and has none of the herbaceousness that often marks Napa Valley Chardonnay. Drink now–2009.
This variety is still a rarity in the valley, though it is up-and-coming. This example displays aromas of funk, black olive, tobacco and mineral that are followed by plump, expressive fruit and savory flavors. It provides a lot of intrigue.
Made entirely with Cabernet Sauvignon, this opens with aromas of toasted oak, scorched earth, underbrush and a balsamic whiff of eucalyptus. The dense palate offers blackberry jam, licorice, cured meat and a confectionery note alongside chewy, close-grained tannins. It's a bit shy on freshness, so drink sooner rather than later.
Lean and bright, this easygoing Vermentino would pair well with fried calamari or vegetable tempura. The palate shows fullness and a fragrant lemon-zest flavor.

A young wine, with crisp apple and grapefruit salad freshness. It is bright, glowing with vibrant fruit and a light touch of toast.
Intense aromas of blue flower, red berry and licorice lead the nose on this full-bodied wine. Menthol, licorice, cake spices and a blast of orange zest complement the juicy, red cherry and black raspberry flavors.
Santa Sofia is a stellar producer with landmark cellars that stand as a proud ambassador for Valpolicella winemaking tradition. This wine is redolent of spice, smoked meat, rum cake, leather and loads of chewy black fruit and prune.
This wine has some pleasant layers of black cherry and tea yet is marred by its unresolve between being thin and overly oaked. The earthiness on display is on the funky side of things.
A bit harsh and rustic in the mouth, with tart acidity and thin cherry, cola and spice flavors. Nonetheless, it's nicely dry and clean.
Sweet peach, mango, papaya, citrus fruit and honey flavors mark this opulent young wine. It brims with acidity, yet is very high in alcohol. Best now with exotic, Asian-inspired spicy dishes.
Hand-picked, whole-cluster pressed, barrel-fermented—this represents one of the directions forward-thinking NZ Sauvignon Blanc producers are pursuing. It's fully ripe and velvety in texture, with toasty, nutty notes but no obvious vanilla overtones, as only used oak is employed. Peach and nectarine flavors finish long and citrusy.
This affordable, straightforward white wine is fresh and crisp, buoyed up with tart acids and flavors of citrus rind, pears, and green apples. It has a bit more concentration than its budget-priced Washington competitors, and the vibrant, clean fruit flavors match well with a wide variety of summer dishes.
Pears, ripe quince and yellow fruits frame this intense, fruity wine. While, yes, it is sec (dry), it is more rich, a mouthful of concentrated white fruits layered with acidity, giving a finely creamy texture just touched with spice.
Honey and fresh orange zest aromas and flavors drive this nicely balanced fortified Muscat. There's a pleasing weightiness to it on the palate, and a slightly creamy texture to go with the pristine flavors. Try with blue cheeses or foie gras.
This is an obviously wood-aged wine with plenty of toast flavors. This wood aging has flattened the fruit giving a wine that is soft with few tannins. It is ready to drink.
This is a nicely balanced wine with bright cherry and berry flavors that are offset by sweet spice, almond and toasted oak. The wood elements already show integration and will continue to diminish with time. Give this wine five or so more years of cellar aging.
Notions of ripe fresh pears and pear compote on the nose segue into the more pliable fruitiness of ripe mirabelle plums. This is off-dry but offset by a little phenolic grip and a lively streak of freshness. Nose, palate and finish all speak of golden mirabelles.
L'Apparita is a divine and delicate expression of Merlot with rich layers of black cherry, blackberry, spice, mocha, cedar, exotic spice and polished stone that are seamlessly woven together. The wine hits the palate with the softness and richness of the world's best Merlots and leaves a fading impression of fruit and spice that can be counted in many long, delicious minutes. Hold until 2018.
Menthol, leather and underbrush aromas lead the nose while the dense palate offers raw sour cherry and dried sage. Bracing tannins grip the finish.
This Prosecco is slightly more rustic or chunky in character but that quality does not necessarily take away from its overall performance, especially if you like this more robust style of sparkler. It is redolent of sweet exotic fruit, pear and melon.
Tasted in October, 2007, the wine was mute, offering little aromatically except for teasing notes of blackberries and oak. That shyness extended to the taste, where strong, hard tannins provide an almost impenetrable coat of armor to what's inside. But right down the middle of the palate is a deep, intensely powerful stream of perfectly ripened cassis that's all the proof you need of ageability. This is a magnificently structured young wine, reminiscent of a fine young Pauillac. Best after 2012, and should have another decade after that, at least.
Subtle aromatics ride a steely frame of straightforward acidity and subtle oak, the wine medium in build and layers. It finishes in a flourish of salty brine.
This wine is rich and smooth, and the power of its tannins are already integrated into the complex plum and blackberry flavors. It has a solid structure, with weight and an open feel.
This is a GSM blend—about two-thirds Syrah—loaded with juicy acidity. The sappy, deep raspberry fruit sinks into the palate, racy and penetrating. It suggests that this is a wine to cellar for awhile. At the moment it suddenly hits a hard stop—a wall of slate and graphite.
The winemaker really squeezed out the cherries and boysenberries in this Merlot, making it super fruity. It's not especially complex, but it will appeal to fans of jammy wines.
Though very pale in the glass, this wine holds no shortage of interest. Honey and roasted marcona almonds consume the nose, and the palate blends bright citrus, lemon curd and cinnamon, all propped up by a perfect, judicious use of oak.
Granted, there haven't been that many, but this is the best California Albariño I've had. A wonderful wine, crisply acidic and deeply flavored. Candied citrus zest, peach pie, pink grapefruit, buttery honeysuckle, apricot, nectarine, and no oak because it doesn't need any. A spectacular food wine or just cocktail. Shows the promise of this variety in the right climate.
This is an orange wine, intentionally oxidized and left in barrel for two years. It's very much like a fino Sherry, with comparable aromatics. What truly distinguishes this effort is the finish that lingers and develops more and more nuances for several minutes. Don't expect anything that resembles Chardonnay, but pair this with salted nuts, meats or fried foods and you will be delighted.
This expression of Sangiovese and 5% Merlot opens with aromas of plum, red berry, toast, grilled herb and a whiff of mocha. On the savory palate, hints of exotic spice, mint and cocoa accent a core of wild cherry. Chewy but fine-grained tannins hold up the juicy flavors.

This Cabernet doesn't seem to have fully ripened with notes of jalapeño pepper, green herbs and cherry with a light styling and gritty tannins.
Specially selected lots account for this top-of-the-line bottling. It's really very good. The fruit tends toward raspberries and cherries, and it's smooth as silk in the mouth. The nutmeg, ginger, cinnamon and peppery notes last for a long time on the finish. The difference between this and the typical Carneros bottling is intensity; the fruit is more focused. It's the difference, say, between a flashlight and a laser.
Dense and savory, this brings together sensations of ripe wild cherry, black raspberry, crushed strawberry, blue flower, cinnamon and white pepper. It's round, soft and ready; enjoy now for the juicy fruit flavors.
With a part of this wine fermented in wood, it is rich and toasty yet still fruity at this stage. The layers of spice go with the ripe, creamy fruit and the mineral, tight texture. All these elements suggest successful aging, so this will be best drunk from 2017.
Elegant and structured, this opens with delicate aromas of Spanish broom, pear and Mediterranean herb. The linear, vibrant palate delivers juicy green apple, creamy pear and citrus alongside an energizing mineral and crisp acidity. This will continue to develop.  Drink through 2020.
This has the capacity to rev-up any meat-based meal thanks to its aromatic intensity and overall spiciness. Sweet and savory at the same time, it delivers black cherry, clove, smoked bacon, leather, cola and dried fruit aromas.
There is a minerally texture to this structured, severe wine. It has some weight, but it shows a stalky black-currant flavor and dry tannins. The finishis lean.
A softly delicious Pinot made for drinking now with upscale fare. It's pale in color and dry, with very rich flavors of Dr. Pepper, raspberry jam and sweet smoky oak, folded into a silky texture.
A bright purple tint announces a jumpy youthful-smelling wine with plum, black currant and oak aromas. This is Carignan, Syrah, Garnacha and Cab Sauvignon, and it's full in body but also juicy and lively. Savory, saucy plum and berry flavors ride a wave of crisp acidity, while the finish feels dry and exact, with minty medicinal overtones. Drink this snappy wine through 2021.
This is a beautiful, intricate and appealing Cabernet to drink with upscale fare, like a very fine steak. It's bone dry, but very rich and sweet in blackberry, cherry and currant fruit, and there's a nice cut of acidity for balance. Steven Kent is producing today's greatest Livermore Cabernets, wines that hearken back to the valley's roots as one of California's best wine regions. Drink now–2013.
Delicate and pretty hints of lemongrass, light cement and lime rinds show on the nose of this bottling. There is a distinct racy quality to the sip, where grassy flavors meet with strong lime and tart pear skins, all hinged to a very grippy texture.
Nicely dry, with a tart cut of citrusy acidity that cleanses the mouth and would certainly cut through the fattiness of lamb or beef dishes. It's tannic, too, with a good stuffing of cherries. Hard to know where it's going in the future, so drink up over the next few years.
Bold, dark, full and saucy, with aromas of plum and blackberry. Jammy but lively on the palate, with vanilla sweetness offsetting plum, blackberry, leather and savory notes. This is true Peumo Carignan with potency and blazing acidity. It's not as flavorful and complete as the 2006, but maybe it just needs another year or two in bottle.
Juicy strawberry and raspberry fruits form the base of an aromatic profile that also picks up some sagebrush and dried cake frosting. Though lighter in body, the flavors emerge continually on the palate, from ripe berries to tomato stew to cola to mint. Serve with roasted chicken or turkey or even a rich pasta.  Bargetto has been making wine since 1933.
Lower in alcohol and more elegant than most Santa Rita Pinot Noirs, this beauty has succulent cherry fruit flavors grounded in earthier notes of tobacco, dried herbs and black pepper. Good now, but should improve after 2011.
Full in the mouth, this is a warm style of wine. It has weight, ripeness and fruitiness with abundant apricot and pear flavors. It is enjoyable now although it will certainly age well. Drink until 2022.
Lightly perfumed wine, with flavors that are off dry, soft and creamy. Almonds, quince and pear give the wine ripeness, but the finish is rather soapy.
This opens with aromas of toasted oak, coffee, underbrush and a hint of fig. The full-bodied palate shows oak, espresso, hazelnut, dark pepper and clove but not much fruit. Assertive tannins grip the finish.
A really good Cabernet that shows elegance and class, and this is a good price for it. Dry and rich in tannins, it has waves of blackberries, black currants, herbs, violets and smoky cedar, and is reminiscent of a good Bordeaux.
Intensely perfumed with notes of white flowers, fresh herbs and citrus rind, this off-dry Riesling is exuberantly floral and fruity from nose to finish. Juicy and ripe, with mango and guava flavors, it bristles with power and energy on the palate.
As in 2003, the blend is 78% Syrah, 22% Sangiovese, all from the Seven Hills vineyard, and aged in 70% new Hungarian oak. The wine looks and tastes a bit oxidative, the fruit is soft and simple, the finish lightly toasty.
This blend of Sauvignon Blanc, Chenin Blanc and Garnacha Blanc is a good-to-go white with fruity, spicy aromas and creamy flavors of pineapple, pear and tropical fruit. A friendly midpalate and spicy finish give it dimension. Its versatile character is good for myriad foods—from creamy cheeses to fresh seafood. Or, sip it alone—it has enough going for it on it own.
A big-boned, rich 100% Merlot, this is a dark and chewy wine whose cherry fruit is set amidst an explosion of hickory smoke, dark chocolate, and tar. The tannins—quite astringent and drying—suggest a long cellar life ahead. Drink it now or lay it down for up to a decade.

This is a dry, racy wine. It fulfills Sauvignon Blanc's first duty of mouthwatering cleanliness and savory acidity. Drink it now as a cocktail sipper, with a shrimp cocktail or with spicy Thai and Vietnamese fare.
The style of this wine may not be for everyone, but there's no doubt that it's a great success for its type. Dry and full bodied, it shows intensely concentrated blackberry, cassis and mineral flavors, wrapped into huge, thick tannins. This absolutely requires aging; begin drinking it in 2016, but even then, it will be just starting to mellow.
This shows the power and purity of the winery's coastal Pastorale and Quarter Moon vineyards, in this cool vintage that allowed for long hang time. Although some coastal Pinots were plagued by rot, this one was not, resulting in a wine with delicious raspberry and cherry notes, accented by new French oak. It's very fine, complex and enjoyable now.
Subtle aromas include crushed flower, forest floor, graphite, black berry and a note of menthol. The ripe palate offers red cherry-berry and a hint of cinnamon alongside muted but drying tannins. Drink through 2021.
Bone dry and tart in acidity, with a silky texture, this Pinot has cherry and rhubarb flavors with an edge of fresh green herbs and peppercorns. It's elegantly structured, and meant for early drinking.
Here's an easy Fiano-based wine from the deep south of Italy. Puglia is not known for its white wines, but this expression does a good job of presenting the sunshine and intensity of the region. It's very thin, but also fresh in the mouth.
Yet another standout effort from this value producer. Clean, penetrating and varietal with layered, spicy fruit—lemon, lime, mint, anise, stone and earth in a marvelously complex array of flavors. 20,500 cases.
One of the producer's lighter-styled wines, delicately delicious, this shows forest floor, orange and lemon in a brightly crisp, high-toned package of polish and grace. A touch of rhubarb--strawberry compote lurks on the finish.
This Sardinian white is so much the opposite of a quaffer that it actually suffers a bit. Lofty intentions and a warm vintage have produced excess weight and sweetness; the banana and vanilla flavors overwhelm. That said, some folks will appreciate the immense flavor and intensity of this Vermentino. Imported by Vias Imports.
Making wine since 961, Pietrafitta presents a crisp, fresh Vernaccia that shows the best characteristics of this historic white wine from Tuscany. Lemongrass, kiwi and peach aromas rise to the front of the bouquet.
Huge, flashy and dramatic, this shows brilliantly ripened fruit and an exquisite texture. Flavor wise, it tastes like pure pie filling seasoned with baking spices. But there's nothing sweet in the finish. Instead, the wine is thoroughly and properly dry, as Merlot should be. Drink now.
Several years of aging has brought out some nice leather and barnyard tones that blend well with the raspberry and cherry fruit. Pleasant vanilla notes grace the moderately long and gripping finish. Although it was quite pretty when first opened, this wine declines in the glass and should therefore be drunk up as soon as possible. Try with smoked meats.
Farmed by the Dutton family, this vineyard offers a generosity of fruit and depth, the nose perfumed in rose and lavender. Grippy texture lies atop a robust density and luxurious mouthfeel, the rich roundness never overwhelmed but instead kept fresh in bright acidity.
Tavel is famous for its rosés, and wines like this are the reason. First, there's the beautiful red rose color. Then the complex, inviting bouquet of cherries, peaches and herbs. Stone fruit flavors are bolstered on the finish by refreshingly cool herb and mineral shadings. A complete package.
A soft wine, full of cherry preserve flavors, along with a bright, fresh waft of acidity. It is just spoilt by the banana flavor from the vinification.
A wine that is proof that not all powerful wines also need high alcohol, this intense 13% ABV wine is concentrated, almost black in its color, a classic Malbec. It has all the solid tannins, structure, the darkest of black plums and licorice flavors. It should age well.
You'll find beautiful, lush, complex, fruit-driven aromas here, as with all the L'Ecole white wines. This captures the complexity of the grape—rarely seen in domestic Chenin Blanc—ripe apples, spice, hints of honey and caramel, and a lovely, persistent floral overtone. In short, this is the Chenin Blanc that should be made, that can be made, and that is rarely made in this state.
A little soft and heavy, but dry, with rich, extracted flavors of berry jam, red licorice, milk chocolate and pepper spice. It's a very good, robust Zinfandel for drinking with barbecue and short ribs.

This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (50%), Merlot (25%), Cabernet Franc (10%), Malbec (10%) and Petit Verdot comes from the winery's young estate vineyard. Aromas of vanilla bean, dried herb, licorice, cranberry and cherry are brooding. The palate offers focused yet restrained fruit flavors and well-balanced acid and tannin. Built for the long haul, it will only improve with some additional time in the bottle.
Saucy and sulfuric at first, but better with time. The palate amounts to a saturated fruit bomb with grip, while the core flavors of cassis and black fruits are very sweet and chunky. Bulky, broad and on the cusp of syrupy. Ripe and ready but maybe too ripe and creamy for its own good.
This single-vineyard Grüner is powerful, with concentrated white fruit flavors, floral aromas and great, crisp, fresh acidity. The fruit is ripe, hinting at creamy, with a soft green aftertaste. Screwcap.

The blend is about two-thirds Pinot Gris and one-third Viognier. Pretty orange-blossom scents lead it off, and it has good acid balance and lots of lemony fruit. Yet it still feels like two separate wines coming together. Spice and pear flavors open up in the glass with a little swirling.
This is a powerhouse of ripe fruits, strong tannins and dark acidity. It burst out of the glass with its bold, firm flavors and solid structure. It is already balanced, the fruit complementing the dense texture. But it will certainly develop more and age very well. Drink in 2016 and until 2022.
From Luna Vineyards, better known for reds, which is perhaps why the front label says only Freakout, comes this interesting Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio and Tocai Friulano blend. It's crisp and fruity, with citrus, wildflower, honey and vanilla flavors that finish with a touch of mineral.

Apple, vanilla and a hint of sulfur is what you'll find on the nose of this consistently solid value-priced Cava. A slightly soft body and flavors of green herbs, melon and white pepper finish well.

A blend of 54% Merlot with smaller percentages of Cabernet Sauvignon (28%) and Cabernet Franc (18%), this is a nicely structured red that's soft, accessible and juicy, with notes of cranberry and cassis liqueur coming to the fore.
Sourced from a so-called “mystery clone” that may have originally arrived in Charles Coury's suitcase back in 1964, this unique old-vine bottling offers exceptional details of dusty cocoa, baking spices, cola, minerals and iron filings.

This is a simple, soft wine with a good deal of charm. It's well made and easy to drink, with pretty black-cherry flavors that spread over the palate. The only drawback is an herbaceous quality that pervades both the aroma, where it's green and stalky, and the palate, where it's positively sharp. But at this price, these are minor quibbles.
Structured and alluring, this opens with yellow stone fruit, tomato vine and chopped herb aromas. The enveloping palate doles out juicy yellow peach, grapefruit and savory thyme notes while tangy acidity lends balance.

Full-bodied and rich, this is full of pineapple fruit flavors and woody spice. The ripeness is allied to an herbaceous character, with almonds giving spice. It will develop quickly into a delicious wine.
This wine shows that top Chablis should be aged. This is like tasting the barebones of the wine without the flesh that is still very hidden. There is suppressed power, as well as green acidity and potential richness. Wait 5 years.
The juiciest fruit gives soft tannins while heightening the acidity. There is a cool element, despite the surface richness of the wine, of jam with a twist of lemon. For drinking now.

Aromas of toasted oak, nut, acacia flower and orchard fruit come together in the glass. The firm palate offers mature yellow apple, candied nectarine zest, toasted hazelnut and flinty mineral. Bright acidity provides balance.

Elegance is the operative word here. This well-balanced Vino Nobile doles out cherry, spice, leather and dried tobacco in equal measure. The wine's natural acidity also does a nice job of meeting the tannins and structure.
Here's a delicious wine, rich and forward in flavor. These Dijon clones produce exceptionally clean, bright fruit, and this Pinot bursts with cherry, pomegranate, rhubarb and cola flavors. It's fully dry, with subtle complexities from oak. Great now and for the next five years, but don't hold it so long that it loses its fruity youthfulness.

Earthy, rich and dry to begin with, and also a tiny bit herbal. The palate is firm, slightly rough and tannic, but as a whole this is a very tasty wine with bold black cherry and blackberry flavors. Finishes quick and easy, and overall it's likable and further proof that Bonarda from Mendoza can complement Malbec.
A Malbec-led blend that's off the grid by Argentine standards but which reflects the northern Salta region. The nose is earthy, herbal, roasted and tomatoey, while the palate is astringent and roasted, with herbal, spicy flavors of tomato, bell pepper and baked berries. Long and baked on the finish, with a slight fiery feel.

A great success, this perfumed and dry wine gives a forward burst of lime juice and green apple. The wine is delicious. Glass stopper.

This wine is dry, rich and a perfect representation of a modern Napa Cabernet. Shows intricate layers of black cherries, black and red currants, cassis and minerals, with the funky layer of bacon and olives that the winery's other 2010 Cabs display. Way too young to drink now. Should begin to open after 2018 and hold its own for another decade.
). Light and lemony on the nose. The palate has some baby fat and flab, but it's acidic enough to have kick. Flavors of sweet, tropical fruits are candied and a touch chunky, referencing pineapple and mango. Drink right away.
A limited-production (150 cases), barrel-fermented and -aged Sauvignon Blanc, this is an intriguing and ambitious wine. The combination of honeyed nectarine, potent leafiness and pencilly oak comes together only to a certain extent—the elements also retain a certain disparate feel. The medium body and silky texture are nicely judged, and the long finish features lively grapefruit notes tinged with coffee.
Turning old, tired and funky, with dried leaf flavors and a tart, rasping finish. This Chard is just too old.
Good melon, apple and vanilla aromas precede honey, vanilla and spice flavors. It's sweet, ripe and easy to drink, with touches of wood and marshmallow. Where this concept wine scores best is on the tongue: It has generous acidity and enough body to ensure balance.
Given its high-octane aroma of barrel and petrol, this Pinot is defined by its need to settle down, more disheveled teenager than the groomed adult it surely will become. The bones are there, dark berry fruit and lurking, earthy spice. There's a developing softness to the texture, the aromas still being worked out.
This is Pepper Bridge Merlot, and it beautifully expresses the vineyard trademarks: fresh fruit flavors of strawberry and raspberry, spread out broadly across the palate, and backed with tart acids and light tannins. There is a strong streak of Asian spicebox as well, but overall the wineis very approachable, which makes it is a Merlot to enjoy with rich fish, such as salmon. It's bright and lightly spicy and not too heavy.
A hint of lemongrass lends complexity to fresh lime, lemon and green plum in this revitalizing dry Riesling. It's light as a feather in texture yet concentrated in flavor. Crushed mineral tones linger on the finish. Drink now through 2020.
Aromas of orange, cantaloupe and creamy yeast don't overreach. This bright, forward, lively Cava tastes of orange, nectarine and cantaloupe. On the finish, a touch of yeasty richness lends weight.

There are swirls of faint red raspberry and black cherry in this wine, otherwise rich in ripe flavor and a taste of red licorice. Soft, satisfying and structured, it's got some weight to it, and some definite grip. A big wine for big meals.
From a vineyard perched 1,700 feet above the Monterey Bay, this wine by brewer-turned-vintner John Benedetti is both very light yet incredibly flavorful. Rusty raspberry and strawberry aromas meet with dill, thyme and white pepper on the nose, while the palate offers soft red cherry and gently sprinkled herbs throughout.

Cherry aromas and flavors and a velvety texture make this light-bodied wine easy to drink. It has black peppery, woodsy notes in the tart cherry flavors and a sense of being aged and ready to drink.

This pleasing effort is light but interesting. It first introduces flavors of strawberry and rhubarb, with a dash of pepper. A whiff of root vegetables does not interfere with the overall enjoyment, and a lick of chocolate lifts the finish.
Some vegetal and mint aromas and flavors compromise this otherwise fruity Pinot Noir. Its cherry pie notes are enriched with caramelized oak, but the total effect is labored.

Simple and tannic, with cherry, tar and herb flavors. The alcohol is low and the mouthfeel is silky.
An intriguing, fabulous dessert wine. The aromas are complex, intense and balanced on a tightrope: mature peach, honey, wet stone, peppermint and delicate mineral nuances. Picolit is an indigenous grape that suffers from a unique disorder in which a good number of berries on each cluster never mature. The remaining berries become concentrated in rich flavor and sugar. Livio Felluga's version is a masterpiece that ends with a fresh, menthol-driven finish and a crisp close. Pair this elegant wine with crème brûlée or a light caramel custard.
Give this wine credit for dryness, crisp acidity and intensity. It's rich and strong in sour black cherry candy, cola, bitter dark chocolate and herb flavors. It's also very tannic, so much so that it's practically undrinkable now. Give it 4–5 years in the bottle, decant, and drink with beef or lamb.
Grassy to the point of excess, this wine's lean, herbal flavors and lemony acids are tart and mouthpuckering.
Asian spices, plum jelly and milk chocolate flavors combine in this solid effort, which lacks only a bit more midpalate weight to really excel. As it stands, it is a tasty wine with a slight dip between start and finish.

From the biodynamically farmed Momtazi vineyard, this adds layers of herb, pine, compost and forest floor components.

Smoke and dark fruit, with a touch of drying mineral and softer background tones of chocolate and rum cake. There's a very polished, dry feel to this wine. The oak notes are still integrating, and the finish is tight and firm.
Toast and chocolate notes vie with bright cherry-berry fruit in this middleweight. Some herb aromas creep in, but they're dried herbs, not the offensive green variety, and they add complexity to this straightforward red.
Ultra-soft, lacking structure, and with some vegetal and herb notes alongside the cherries. Not very satisfying, but drinkable.
Part of King Estate's ambitious Limited Edition program for Pinot Gris, this is packaged in a hock bottle with a label styled for a European look.

Always a star turn, Haut-Marbuzet hasn't failed in 2002. It is a modern style of wine, dominated by toast and wood tannins. But there is plenty of rich, black fruit to balance, and the spices and vanilla flavors are already blending well together.
For a vintage-style fortified, this wine's color is appropriately intense and dark, but the tannins are somewhat tame. Hints of mint and chocolate pop up, adding modest complexity, but the bold cassis and plum fruit is framed instead by its crisp acids, suggesting a rather early drinking window, perhaps 2013–2020 or so.
Already lightening in color and possessing only modest cherry fruit, this supple wine should be consumed over the next few months.

The richness suggests drinking with lobster, crab and scallop dishes.
The style of Cantenac-Brown is generally softer, richer than other Margaux, and this 2001 is no exception. It has a perfumed character, which has sweet, meaty flavors over ripe fruit.

A little sweet with the glycerine of high alcohol, and there may be some residual sugar. That gives the raspberry, cherry and blackberry fruit a jelly-jam richness, with nuances of chocolate, anise liqueur and toast. Drink now.

From the northern Vinho Verde region of Melgaço which is the natural heartland of Alvarinho, this tangy, fruity wine bursts with acidity and creamed apple flavors. It is still young, a lively and fruity wine that will benefit from some calming down and broadening out. Drink from the end of 2015.

Stern, almost severe initially, this great wine takes time to show its immense fruit power. Black currant and blackberry notes are packed into the wine, along with an impressive array of spices from new wood that gives a more exotic element.

Initially, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Tempranillo smells vegetal, although the nose settles on saucy tomato and bell pepper.

A lovely, accessible wine to drink over the next few years.

Fans of fresh, juicy fruit will love this wine's raspberry and cherry jam, red licorice and strawberry Twizzler flavors. The blend is based on Syrah, and the alcohol is high enough to give it some heat on the finish.
This wine has an extra measure of creaminess in the texture while giving up floral, lightly spicy and wonderfully fruity flavors. There's no obvious oak influence, just ripe raspberry, strawberry and macerated black-cherry notes that softly coat the palate and cling to the finish.
This is the finest of the winery's three new rosés, and kudos to them for specializing in blush. The vineyard is in the Green Valley, and the wine shows long hangtime raspberry and cherry fruit, brightened with crisp acidity. It all leads to a dry, spicy finish, and the alcohol is a refreshingly low 13.2% by volume.
There's a unique exotic quality to this wine that translates into red cherry, spice, dark peach, incense and sandalwood. Medium-bodied but extremely flavorful and tangy in the mouth, with integrated tartness and supple tannins. Imported by Tosco Wines.

This all-Sangiovese Chianti offers black-skinned fruit and new leather aromas. The firm palate delivers prune and ripe tangerine fruit, framed by smooth tannins.
Starts out neutral but soon it develops a dominant Viognier personality. It's got all the fruits in a fruit salad covered: green melon, cantaloupe, banana, mango and others come to the fore. Fresh and ready at this young stage, with upright structure and nothing cloying. Drink this year, preferably well chilled.
Cherry, plum and raspberry aromas are basic but clean. This is a midlevel, good wine with a medium body and nothing abrasive or biting. Modest flavors of chunky berry fruits finish loamy and earthy.
This refreshing red has plenty of forward berry flavors, with Grenache and Syrah making up the majority of the blend. It fades quickly, and seems best suited for near-term enjoyment.

Hints of oak smooth out the inherent herbal character of the grape, yielding ripe tones of apricot and pineapple. This wine is ripe and fruity and ready to drink.
This is a tremendous wine that's packed with flavor and dramatically structured. It's made in the modern cult style of exceptionally rich and ripe with sweet, toasty oak, and delicious blackberries, black currants, dark chocolate and anise. The tannins are strong, but refined. Begin popping the cork in eight years, and this beauty could still be going strong in 2028, maybe beyond.
This is certainly a rich wine, the yellow peach flavors ripe and concentrated. But there is also a hard core where the botrytis dominates and makes for a tight character. It is missing charm.
This is one of those Chardonnays that's delicious from the first sip. It's not complicated, but is rich in mango, yellow peach and oak-inspired buttered toast, butterscotch, honey and vanilla bean flavors. The grapes are from the Oak Knoll District, and the wine has refreshing acidity.
Intense bramble notes and a hint of earth lend savoriness to crisp red cherry and berry in this dry rosé. While delicate in concentration, refreshing acidity and brisk texture make this a lovely summer apéritif.

The wine is ripe, yet with a line of green acidity and touches of bell pepper.
Even in a flight of top BAs and TBAs, this one stood out. It's hugely sweet and viscous, yet also has amazingly fresh acids that really prolong the finish and promise decades—if not centuries—of cellaring. Golden raisin and dried apricot notes are true to type, and the wine's balance is impeccable.
Incanto shows modern touches of spice and leather backed by dark fruit and prune. In the mouth, the wine shows soft, rich density and one dimensional cherry fruit.
This opens with warm, earthy, horsey aromas that become cleaner with airing. A muscular palate with hard tannins and evident tartaric acidity creates edgy flavors that are matched by vanilla and darker-fruit notes of raspberry and plum. This is hard now, a bit disjointed and short in spots. Drink from 2016 through 2026 for best results.
Opens with an aromatic blast of graphite, peppery spice and rubber along with meaty black-fruit scents. Feels round and a bit wayward, with middling fruit, peppery accents and moderate sweetness. Finishes heavy and condensed, with jamminess.

The palate presents juicy wild cherry, crushed black raspberry, white pepper, cinnamon and grilled herb alongside firm, refined tannins and bright acidity. A tobacco note closes the finish. It's already accessible but also shows staying power. Drink 2018–20230.

This light, crisp quaff is made from 75% Pinot Grigio and 25% Vermentino, a white that's found a happy home in Lodi. It shows green apple, apricot and fig around a core of fresh citrus, finished by a polishing of vanilla.
Sharp and gritty in the mouth, with cutting acidity. Despite nice cherry, spice and sandalwood flavors, the texture is too peppery tart.
This is one of the drier Sauvignon Blancs on the market, showing palate-cleansing acidity and citrus flavors that make it extremely drinkable.

This value-oriented release spent time in one-fifth new oak, and it shows nicely in the nose and the flavor. Ample red fruits are coated with sweet toast and a touch of ginger cookie. The wine has excellent length and polish, especially at this price point.
This totally acidic wine is crisp and shockingly tart. Fruit has been overtaken by acidity that gives the wine a very fresh, very tangy character.
Named for the Entav clone, this is an earthy, herbal and dense 100% Cabernet Franc, hard to find in the Napa Valley and a special calling of this producer. Black plum, currant and a sense of restraint rise above the fray in this wine, which remains sizable in tannins and tight on the finish, suggesting time in the cellar, through 2021.
From this very high mountain vineyard in the Sierra Foothills comes this fine, although tannic, 100% Syrah. It certainly has Northern Rhône aspirations, in the peppery, leathery complexities that accompany the blackberry, currant and cedar flavors. Those aforementioned tannins are big-time, but a slice of grilled beef will tame them.
This is a beautiful, crisp Sauvignon Blanc, one of the best out there at this price. It shows clean, crisp acidity and a wonderful, mouth-scouring minerality, with rich flavors of Meyer lemon pie, Key lime yogurt and vanilla. Compelling and so food-friendly.

Polished and sophisticated Chard, easy to like for its dry crispness, and the way the bright acidity perks up the tropical fruit and mineral flavors. It's 100% barrel-fermented, but the oak feels very natural and seamless. Finishes with real class and elegance.
Barrel tones of coconut and woodspice take the lead in front of cranberry and blackberry, with the fruit seeming a bit dried out. It's reserved in style but still fully flavored with sour cherries accented by licorice.

Fresh bell pepper and passion fruit aromas are a bit underripe in character. The palate feels juicy and bright, with zesty acidity. Nectarine and green-herb flavors hint at vegetal undertones, while the finish is short but fresh. Drink now.
Full of violet, flowery aromas that descend into oak, blackberry and cigar, this is a muscular Tempranillo with a feminine side, big yet smooth with subtle blueberry sweetness. Grown from the Rolleri Vineyard above Angels Camp and given 18 months of barrel age, this would make a spectacular pairing with wintertime roasts and stews.
Only a small proportion of barrel-aged wine goes into this blend, so the emphasis is on bright pear and melon fruit, backed by concentrated citrus flavors. It's lighter in weight and less richly textured than Clearview's Reserve or Endeavour bottlings, but is still a charming Chardonnay for drinking over the next couple of years.
Perfumed, ripe and packed with blackberry fruits, this wine displays a great sense of elegance. It is fresh while the solid structure provides a contrast of tannins. The end shows acidity and fruitiness.
One of the best values on the market now. Totally delicious in raspberries, cherries and pie spices, and so silky. Lovely tannins, crisp acidity, everything about it is likeable. What a great by-the-glass wine for restaurants.
Shows rich, forward pineapple tart and crème brûlée flavors that are satisfying and dry. Delicious and spicy, although it's just a bit sharp. Drink now.
From one of the few vineyards in Santa Barbara County to grow this grape, this bottling plays to the savory side. White pepper and raw beef show alongside tight and tart boysenberry fruit. Wild-berry flavors on the sip meet with dried sagebrush, thyme and potpourri elements.
This is a high-acid, young Pinot. Bone dry and tart, it has green mint-infused, bitter cherry flavors, and the texture is nice and silky, even elegant. Yet it lacks the sensual opulence you want in a fine Pinot, and doesn't seem likely to age.
This Serbian 100% Portuguiser offers scents of dried cherry, dried herbs and fresh tarragon, and follows up with tastes of red plum and dried strawberry.
A vibrant purple color and foxy berry aromas announce the jammy palate and punchy acidity of this wine. It tastes of herbal plums and berries and doesn't hold up on the oaky, pulpy finish.
There was significant variation among three different bottles opened. At best this is a tannic, somewhat reductive wine with light fruit that is overwhelmed by new American oak. At worst it tastes mostly of charred wood, bitter smoke, tar and rubber.
Coming from one of the state's most esteemed vineyards, Cabernet Sauvignon makes up 83% of this wine, with the balance Cabernet Franc.

Simple and sweet, like a fruit juice blend of apples, peaches and pineapples you buy in the supermarket.
Splashes of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot make their way into this vineyard-designate, a well-made offering of cola and blackberry with supple tannins. Layered and complex, it's medium in weight and length, with a density of oak on the finish. Drink now through 2020.
Made with Moscato, this sparkling dessert wine opens with aromas of fragrant white flower, apricot and a note of chopped herb. The foaming palate offers dried apricot, yellow peach and candied nectarine zest while a lemon drop note signals the close.
A wine with overly pronounced smoky, oaky and toasted bacon aromas and flavors that block out most of the lush dark fruit so wanting in a Tempranillo; more tobacco than black cherry or plum.
All estate-grown. Sappy, saturated and deep purple in color, it is vibrantly youthful despite two years of aging. The mixed berry and Bing cherry fruit flavors are highlighted with racy acids, and the aromas carry the characteristic Spring Valley nuances of fresh hay and alfalfa. There seems to be a little CO2 remaining, and the wine needs still more time to knit together. Just 169 cases produced.
Snappier and more crisp than in the past; this blend of Cabernet and Malbec hits with red-fruit aromas and a touch of vanilla. Next comes raspberry flavors mixed with cola, vanilla and a dollop of butter. Has staying power and depth, but is a little short on core fruit.
Unripe, with green peppercorn and asparagus notes alongside the blackberries. The tannins are strong and the acidity is biting. Drink now.
Pollen and dusty mineral tones lend earthiness to melon and lychee aromas on this off-dry Gewürztraminer. Medium bodied in style, it balances tart tangerine acidity with a round, rich mouthfeel.
Perfumed berry, rose, new leather and dark spice are some of the enticing scents you'll find in this vibrant wine. It's still tightly wound but already dazzles with juicy wild cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon, nutmeg and pipe tobacco flavors. Youthfully austere but noble tannins and bright acidity provide balance and serious aging potential. Don't be tempted to open it soon—the best is yet to come. Drink 2022–2042.
A fabulously rich and approachable Pinot Noir that offers everything now, yet will also age. The considerable tannins will protect it in the cellar for a good 6–8 years, but it's so fresh and vibrant in cherries, red currants and oak-inspired red licorice that it's hard not to drink it now. Hard to exaggerate the deliciousness factor.
This is light and lightly herbal, an elegant take on the grape, and a good food wine. As with all Seven Hills wines, this is done in a moderate, sippable style; it is balanced and true to the variety but may seem less than perfectly ripe to some palates.
Underbrush, truffle, ripe red berry, violet and pipe tobacco aromas emerge on this beautiful, structured red. The delicious, full-bodied palate shows ripe black cherry, fleshy raspberry, star anise, ground pepper and clove framed in ripe, velvety tannins. A generous, gorgeous wine.
Starts off slowly, but opens considerably with air—so much so that it's probably worth decanting as you might a bottle of young white Burgundy. It's buttery and full, yet possesses a stony mineral quality that gives it balance. Initial peppery-spicy notes on the finish smooth out the longer it sits in the glass. Editors' Choice.
A deeper and richer specimen than most, with root beer and toast aromas backing up ripe black fruit. This is a drink-now, ripe-styled wine with fleshy black-fruit flavors and some coffee and bitterness to the finish. Not too tannic, so drink right away.
It's all about flavor in this tasty Grenache. It's very rich in raspberries, cherries, mocha, orange zest, cinnamon and vanilla bean, with a touch of smoked butter. Could be drier and firmer, though, as it's a little sweet and soft.
Hugonis is a 50-50 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Nero d'Avola, with balanced fruit, spice, chocolate, leather and a modern, creamy endnote. This is an appealing wine that would pair beautifully with steak or pork chops.

This offers aromas of bell pepper and raisin, with a whiff of toast. The warm, round palate shows ripe black-fruit flavors, layered with red-bell-pepper and coffee accents. You'll also notice an alcoholic warmth to the close.
Intense aromas of tomato leaf, hay and honeydew melon lead the nose and follow through to the lively palate along with tangerine, peach and an energizing mineral vein. It's balanced, with lively acidity that gives this a clean, dry finish. It's an exceptional effort for this cool, wet vintage.
Does the devil (diable) sell wine? Obviously this producer think so. It's a very pale-colored wine, almost white, with light, stylish fruit that is as much about acidity as fruitiness. It's hardly devilish, but pleasant enough.
Grenache is a terribly hard variety to make on its own. It's better used as a blender, which this wine proves. It's dry and silky, with one-dimensional cherry, blueberry and oak flavors. Drink now.
Notes of crushed black pepper and cedar against a backdrop of ripe red fruit are pleasant on this full-bodied Cab Franc, but hints of green reeds and resin distract.
One of the oldest vineyards in Bordeaux, founded by Pope Clément in the 14th century. This white is full, rich, packed with white fruits. It shows crispness, toast and spice, already well integrated.
The Bandol appellation gives this wine structure, density and a sense of tannins. It makes for a wine that will be excellent with food, rich and firm. It should age for a few more months, so drink from early 2016.
Aromas of mature citrus zest and a whiff of medicinal herb carry over to the extremely informal but brisk palate along with bitter yellow-apple skin. It's simple and vivacious, with vigorous bubbles.
This wine has uniqueness to it, as Central Otago is primarily Pinot Noir country. That said, the wine displays pretty traditional Sauvignon Blanc notes of passion fruit, pink grapefruit and nectarine. Attractive textural richness on the midpalate  fades quickly on the finish.
Pizza, burgers and other everyday foods that forgive rusticity are what to drink with this ripe, highish alcohol wine. It offers typical warm climate California flavors of black cherry jam and mocha.
Black pepper and thick smoke accentuate the bouquet of this cinnamon-spiced wine, rounded out in taste by red plum and dark chocolate. Soft and juicy on the front palate, it will benefit with time to open further, suggesting either a decant or time in cellar, through 2020. The wine is blended with 7% Cabernet Sauvignon.
Ripe fruit tones of raspberry jam and blackberry jelly open the bouquet giving this Brunello a plump, sun-kissed personality. It shows a dark garnet color in the glass and has flavors of toasted espresso bean, tobacco, leather and spice with aromatic vanilla endnotes.
Bland aromas suggest applesauce. This varietal Xarello feels plump but flat. Candied, generic white-fruit flavors are nonspecific, while this offers up citrus notes and pyrazines on the finish.
A smooth, fruity wine, with fine red-cherry flavors and very soft tannins. It is spoiled by a banana flavor that intrudes into the fresh fruit.
Tender apple and pear notes make for a fresh, crunchy toned-down palate. The fresh fruit is highlighted by lemon freshness; likewise the almost fizzy midpalate finishes with off-dry lemon hints.

Corvina, Rondinella, Corvinone and Oseleta grapes make up the formula for this rich and very velvety Amarone. There's a very nice, smooth quality to this wine that is supported by bright berry and spice aromas.
This has a tight, severe character, with black currant fruit and a touch of green bell pepper. It's stalky and structured, with a lean feeling.
Creamy-textured and more rounded than you might expect from a Grüner Veltliner, but mouthfilling and tasty. Hints of honey and melon are accented by ripe citrus, finally ending on a tangerine note.
Light as if it were even older than it is, but nicely perfumed and mild in scope. The nose is mature and woodsy, while the palate is light, acidic and still dancing with plum and cherry. Best if you don't expect too much from it.
Structured, tight and linear at first, and then air unveils good oak notes, red fruit and tobacco. Ripe and loaded in the mouth, with bold cassis and cherry flavors. Good tannins, spice, warmth, and a pleasing outlook make this a winner. Imported by Laird & Company.
Tart and tannic, with aromas that promise deep black fruits touched with smoky earth. A Merlot for Cabernet lovers, with a Cab Franc-like streak of coffee around powerful, dark fruit flavors of berry and cassis. Give this a lot of breathing time, or pop it in the cellar for at least five years.

An elegant wine that slides easily over the palate. Its red berry flavors have a firm edge that stiffens the initial softness. Its tannins and acidity make this a serious, food-friendly wine that could age.
This longstanding collaboration between vintner and grower reflects years of mutual understanding and respect. The wine offers pretty orange blossom and lemon verbena aromas that wrap around a composed, well-integrated and mineral-laden body. Voluptuous, the wine is also well-balanced, finishing in bright acidity. It is deliciously good.
This is the second wine from the Château Grenouilles vineyard, very fresh, but at the same time weighty and concentrated, with wood, caramel and generous fruits. Age for 5 years.
Roasted and leathery on the nose, without much fruit. The palate is full, rubbery and baked tasting, with herbal berry flavors. Finishes cooked and heavy as well, with a sauciness that overrides any freshness of fruit. A downer compared to the fresher 2008 version.
With Pascal Dalbeck, owner of Classed Growth Saint-Emilion property Château Belair, at the helm, this wine promises good things. It's meaty, well-rounded, but still with good chewy tannins. And there are great fresh red fruits and lively acidity to lift up the richness. Only bottled in 50 cl and in magnums.

91-93. Barrel sample. Ripe and spicy, with delicious open fruit, this wine is rounded yet has a straight line of pure acidity. It has a light touch while showing depth of flavor for the future.
Sourced from high atop Michael Mondavi's Atlas Peak vineyards, this is feral and intense in black currant liqueur and leather, the mountain tannins up front and fierce. Cellaring until 2014–2019 will do further wonders for this wine.
A nervy young wine, marked by fruity acidity and primary flavors of blackberry and cherry jam, cocoa and spices, wrapped into strong tannins. A bit rude now, but with the balanced integrity to develop over the next 2–4 years.
One of the most untouched, terroir-driven Malbecs made in Argentina is Achaval-Ferrer's Altamira. It's harvested about three weeks earlier than most high-end fruit, resulting in core raspberry flavors and a certain redness of character. The wine is unfined and cloudy but still very clear on the palate, with length, power and class. Best from 2009–2012.
One of the top offerings from Saint Clair is invariably its Omaka Reserve. The 2010 features blackberry and cola notes that are accented by a hickory smoke tone, a harmonious and supple texture and a moderately long finish. Ready to drink now, the wine should easily last another few years.
A bit of oak has left behind hints of coffee and scorched sugar to frame the modest melon-like fruit. Drink this medium-bodied, chunky white over the next year or two.

Here's a big, thick, ripe Pinot Noir. It's not clearly a whole lot better than Morgan's regular Double L Pinot, which costs far less.

Direct and fruity, this Chardonnay is loaded with lemon.

89-91. Barrel sample. Spicy wood cuts through the ripe blackberry fruit. This wine is smooth and polished, with balancing acidity. Juicy fruits show on the finish.
This full-bodied wine is packed with fruit and spice notes and is especially broad and mouth-filling. Made from mostly Grenache and Mourvèdre, with a dash of Syrah, it has generous ripe plum, macerated cherry and black pepper flavors that spread across the palate and linger on the finish.
The Oak Cask in the name is evident in the bacon, vanilla and creamy berry aromas that open things up. The palate, however, is fairly acidic, making the fruit taste bright and feel zesty. Flavors of cherry and plum are distinctly red in character, and the finish is quick and lean.
Unoaked, and  with no malolactic fermentation, this clean, refreshing wine is bright in apple, peach and pear flavors. It has a rich vein of acidity.
Flint and flower aromatics introduce this wine, which follows with delicate (for the vintage) flavors of apple and mineral. It was aged 12 months in a concrete egg, and finished in stainless steel.

Light in color, this equally light-bodied red has spiky acidity and intense flavors of rose petal, lilac and black tea. Bittersweet on the finish, it leans more savory than fruity, providing intrigue and earth.
It shows an altogether riper aspect of Grüner. Yellow pear, yellow plum and notions of peach appear and give way to a rounded, generous palate with lots of phenolic backbone and structure. It can definitely shine with substantial food.
This brunello offers a pretty bouquet, showing elegance and restraint at the same time. There are layers of small berry fruit, spice and leather, with dusty, dry tannins. The wine's overall astringency should soften with time.
Candied apricots, blossom honey and notions of orange zest take turns in dazzling the nose and palate, while musky botrytis lends a rounded note to the mouthfeel, melding all together into sweet BA harmony. Simply lovely, now or in future years.
Drinkable, but just barely, even at this everyday price. It's soft and cloyingly sweet, with raspberry and cocoa flavors.
The pear, apple, toast and cinnamon aromas are light and elusive. The flavors are elegant, with the concentration trailing toward the finish.
A Bordeaux blend, with 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 16% Cabernet Franc and 24% Merlot, supposedly named because a passing Bulgarian described the wine as Magia (magical). In fact, it is in an elegant style, not hugely intense, but with good berry flavors, some herbal character and a sweet, juicy finish.
While this wine certainly tastes old, it has a delicious golden glow from the richness of the apricot jelly-flavored ripe fruit. There is just a touch of spirit, but this adds to the warmth. Imported by Jack Poust & Co., Inc.
Dark, smoky and chewy, this young, tannic effort could stand in for any good Walla Walla Syrah from a dozen different producers. It is a testament to the quality of Washington Syrah; but also an example of the sameness that plagues many of them. There is a nice core of juicy boysenberry, and beyond that it's all about roasted coffee, bitter chocolate and toast.
Full-bodied and fudge-like, this is a big black chocolaty Shiraz. Hints of cracked pepper and dried fruit run through this rich, thickly textured wine. It's ready to drink now.
A classic Brunello with a savory, aged quality that exudes sophistication and elegance. Dried fruit, cassis, spice, old leather and rum cake form the bouquet. The wine is finely textured, sharp and clean in the mouth. Seems aged, savory and austere.
The grapes are from Oak Knoll, a southerly, cooler district, and while the wine is very ripe and oaky, it has bright acidity. That makes for a wonderful balance to the lush cherry pie, cassis and chocolate flavors. So delicious and drinkable now, it will be hard to keep from opening, but should age well for a decade.
Hard tannins, dryness and brisk acidity can't hide the enormous core of blackberries and currants. It was clearly grown in a cool climate. The wine doesn't seem likely to develop, so drink soon, with barbecue to cut through the tannins.
Shows quite oaky now, with powerful notes of vanilla, char and wood sap, but it's also rich in cherry fruit, with a touch of grilled meat. Texturally, this Cab is dense, smooth, fine and very dry, with substantial tannins. It's too young now, but should be a beauty by 2008 and beyond.
Pioneering winemaker Josh Jensen delivers pure and focused aromas of deep red pomegranate and dark purple fruits, a shred of violet, a noticeable chalkiness and a hint of sweet sage. It's rich and zesty on the palate, offering dark fruit flavors with a pine sap backbone, finishing strong on chocolate-dipped cherries.
This basic Chardonnay has a muted apple-earth nose and shows some tangy green apple flavors on the palate. The crisp acid spine keeps it lean, but it's even, not sharp—reminiscent of a decent Mâcon. Finishes with mild spices and moderate length.
Disappointing considering the price. There's no good reason to pay $40 for a cava that's cidery and offers hints of vinegar along the way. That said, this is not a cheaply made disaster unworthy of a rating; still, it's austere and hints at sauerkraut.
Not a whole lot going on in this soft, simple wine. The cherry, raspberry and root beer flavors are ultraripe, with a liqueured quality, and the finish is semisweet.
Smells strange, with aromas that are hard to identify or label. The palate is tangy, with pickled, resiny flavors and a dead-end finish. Suggestive of sauerkraut; not very good Chardonnay.
Good blackberry, currant and cedar flavors, and properly dry, with a good background of smoky oak. But it's way too soft, causing structural collapse.
Sourced from 25-year-old vines, this shows traces of dried leaf, along with tart rhubarb and wild cherry fruit. A light dusting of cinnamon and coffee completes a wine that is balanced throughout, medium in length, and finished with an elegant flair.
Mature, earthy and soft on the nose, with roasted, spicy, integrated berry aromas. Full but baked feeling, with maturity and monotone flavors of sweet berries that don't vary. It remains roasted and warm on the finish. Drink soon.
As good as North Coast-appellation Cabs get, this one is very dry, tannic and fleshy, with good varietal character and a rich, full-bodied mouthful of blackberries, cherries, plums and coffee. Drink now.
A Bordeaux-style blend that is a barrel selection from estate fruit. The tannins are substantial in all the Cave B reds, but particularly so here––thick and astringent to the point of chalky. There is interesting depth and some high-toned red fruits.
Attractive salmon pink color, fresh raspberry flavor and lively acidity: it's all there with this deliciously, crisp, summertime rosé. There is just a touch of toastiness to give it some complexity, but freshness and openness are the main characters of this wine. Imported by Vitis Imports.
Dark and dense as the dead of night, this robust RDD is pushing aromas of blackberry, cassis, black tea and cola. The palate is reaching maturity while showing energy and balance. Flavors of root beer, savory beef, soy and vanilla accent blackberry fruit, while the finish is plump, with ready tannins. Drink through 2022.
Aromas of lemon blossom, pear and citrus lead the nose, with a whiff of bread dough. The dry palate delivers mature yellow apple, lemon zest and toasted almond alongside bright acidity and a lively perlage.
This is a ripe and chewy expression of Gaglioppo (a grape from Southern Italy) with sharp aromas of wet earth, ripe blackberry, wild mushroom and tobacco leaf. The wine offers a firm structure and enough acidity to pair with cheese dishes or béchamel sauce.
Named for farmer David Osgood's beloved hat, this blend of Zinfandel and Petite Sirah shows plump boysenberry, black raspberry, peppercorn and wet rock scents. Dense tannins dominate the palate, framing plush red plum, dark strawberry and clove-like spice flavors.
Whiffs of blossoms accent aromas of fresh apples and dusty minerals on this semi-sweet Riesling. It dances nervously on the palate with pretty white peach and floral notes accented with a streak of puckery lemon-lime acidity. Finishes with a hint of savory dried herbs.
The Marcarini is a luscious, grapy Dolcetto. A bright fruit-driven nose, with a touch of spice, richly textured and an easy if not particularly long finish. Solid Dolcetto with a winning personality.
Plum and cherry aromas are earthy and generic. This wine feels pinched and high in acidity. Flavors of tart plum and berry fruits are racy, while a long, salty, tannic finish is pushed by crisp acidity.
Huber's entry-level bottling comes across as somewhat conflicted in 2008, with aromas of mushrooms and twigs, but flavors more reminiscent of ripe cherries; plump and round in the mouth, but crisply acidic, almost zingy on the finish.
Made from 40% Syrah, 30% Grenache, 20% Mourvèdre and 10% Carignan, this Roussillon rosé opens with elegant notes of green pepper and savory herbs that frame the tight red cherry and underripe melon fruits. Medium in weight and a touch plush in feel, red cherry and berry tones dominate the palate, but finish bright and with a slightly bitter, fruit skin-like edge on the close.
A rich, smoky style of wine that revels in its high toast character as well as ripe yellow fruit flavors. It is certainly full in the mouth, a burst of ripeness followed by balancing acidity and a texture of red apple skins. It would be worth aging for another year.
A big, full nose of berry fruit and spice is followed by friendly waves of spice, pepper and bright fruit. A simple but likeable profile—pair with hearty stews and spicy meats.
For freshness, it is worth buying this young LBV. It has all the structure needed, a dark chocolate undertone, but it is the fresh black fruits and the lift of acidity that make it so attractive.
Aromas of plum, wild herbs and tobacco are mature and suggest that this is ready to drink. In the mouth, this is medium-bodied, with clarity and a sense of freshness. Plum, berry and cherry flavors finish in harmony. Drink through 2020.
Moderately stalky aromas of tomato and horsey plum lead to berry and plum flavors that are herbal and stalky, much like the nose. A roasted, stalky character is maintained on the finish.
Sourced from the cool Awatere Valley, this wine displays some of that region's characteristic leafiness. It also shows hints of cruciferous and root vegetables, medium body and crisp, red-fruit flavors on the finish.
Some German vineyards suffered from low acidity in 2006, but Wagner's portion of the Saarburger Rausch was obviously not one of them. This is unusually light, tart and fresh for the vintage, with classic green apple, citrus and slate aromas and flavors and incredible focus. Very refreshing. Imported by Chapin Cellars, LLC.
The pink hue is a little flat. That also applies to the palate, with the fruit showing some maturity and hinting at wood aging. It's a rounded style, full in the mouth, with ripe caramel flavors at the end. Drink now.
Sharp, medicinal and a little skunky to start with, and it remains acidic, tangy and hard in the mouth, with cranberry and cough medicine for flavors. Herbal and cutting on the finish. Not much to write home about.
The Pellegrini style seems to emphasize extraction. That's great-up to a point. In this wine, the slightly weedy cassis fruit adequately balances the starching tannins, yielding an age-worthy wine that should develop for up to 10 years.
Winemaker: Bartho Eksteen. This wooded Sauvy shows incredible restraint, harmony and balance. It opens with attractive notes of ripe gooseberry, apple flesh and green melon rind. The palate offers more just-ripe tropical-fruit tones, with a pleasantly pithy texture and lime-rind flavors that hang on through the lingering finish. Enjoy now for the bright acidity, though it should mature well through 2020.
Quite young, grassy and pungent, this has piercingly tart flavors of green berries and lime, much in the New Zealand mode, though not quite as ripe. Some light, appropriate, citrus rind bitterness creeps into the finish.
Fairly priced, this entry-level New Zealand Pinot offers herbal and black cherry aromas and flavors. It's a bit simple and fruity, but finishes clean, with crisp acids. Imported by Icon Estates.
A blend of 49% Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Merlot, 6% Cabernet Franc and 5% Petit Verdot, this wine offers aromas of cherry, brambles, vanilla and lavender. Mildly chewy yet smooth tannins persist among flavors of cherry, blueberry, violet, slate and cranberry. There is a nice play between fruit and floral flavors, with fruit winning out on the fresh finish.
Tons of blackberry, black cherry and cassis flavors in this dry, tannic wine. It's somewhat direct now, like fruit jam tarted up with citrusy acidity. Could age well, but it's a close call to predict.
If you like tart, green gooseberries in your white wines, this is for you. It has that rather vegetal, feline flavor, alongside riper lemons and limes that finish basically dry and crisp.
Rich red cherry, rhubarb and alpine strawberry aromas meet rust and shaved licorice on the nose of this beautiful bottling from the Parker family's cool-climate vineyard. It's deceptively light on the palate, with airy flavors that intensify to exotic cherry, mulberry, tea leaf and maduro cigar, framed by firm, structured tannins. Drink 2020–2024.
Soft and luxurious, this is made from Merlot and Cabernet, and it offers rich, complex flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants, dark chocolate, herbs, spices and cedar.
Only produced in the best vintages, Caracci is a beautifully golden colored wine that opens with very immediate aromas of dried fruit or apricot, lemon zest, honeysuckle and almond paste. It feels crisp, direct and fresh on the close.
This dull, rustic wine offers earth and anise flavors around a core of soft cherry fruit. Light bodied, its acidity is moderate and unobtrusive.
Here's one for the cellar. Still youthful, the wine brims with fresh acids and dry tannins that leave behind an astringent finish. Clos du Val Cabernets age well over decades, and this one stays true to the winery's Médoc-oriented vision, marching to its own beat in an age of drink-me-now wines. Stash until 2009, at least.
Powerful and dense, this wine has great potential. With full-bodied blackberry fruits and acidity that push through the dark tannins, it shows a rich character that is impressive for the year. Drink from 2020. The property has been owned since 1999 by Sophie Lurton of neighboring Château Bouscaut.
While pulpy and ripe on the nose with aromas of blackberry and cherry compote, this Cabernet Franc runs towards the savory side on the palate. Bold in body and alcohol, it's rich with red fruit, but has a musty, earthen tone that persists through the finish.
There is an aromatic, herbal lift among the full-fruited nose of this wine that is reminiscent of freshly peeled curls of ripe Cox Orange Pippin apples. The palate adds a pleasantly bitter, slightly phenolic edge that gives texture and and counterbalance to the soaring freshness of the citrus and apple notes. Concentration and power come in a compact, taut package that is likely to unfold a little more with bottle age. It finishes with the rich and honest flavor of crisp, ripe apples. Compelling now but it will be even better. Drink 2017–2030.
Delicate scents of citrus, white stone fruit and a whiff of crushed rock come together on this luminous wine. The vibrant palate offers peach, citrus and a hint of apple alongside lively acidity and a mineral note.
This Rothschild-Catena blend is dark as night on the nose, with a strong blast of freshly laid pavement. The palate is a little more acidic and snappy than expected, and as the wine unfolds it offers clean and persistent red-fruit flavors but nothing extraordinary.
Clean, fresh aromas of plum, raspberry and cherry give this wine a red-fruited personality. The mouthfeel supplies grip and mild tannic clamp, while flavors of plum and berry come with a touch of resiny oak. This crianza is textured and solid on the finish, but still fresh. Drink now through 2017.
Bright and drinkable with easygoing green fig, underripe melon, herbs and sweet lemon drop flavors. Approachable and balanced with medium acidity and a crisp finish. Drink now.
Jason Bull makes this wine for the owners, fermenting it in neutral oak that nonetheless yields a rich wine with buttery, toasty, spicy highlights. The light tropical (banana and papaya) fruit is nicely cloaked in butterscotch, with plenty of acidity to buoy it. It's both refreshing and compact, with a drinking window of now through 2020.
Pretty mineral notes recall chalk and dusty ash and provide depth and dimension to this fresh and fragrant white wine. There's not much fruit, but the wine pulls its own thanks to those mineral nuances and its crisp acidity.
This wine takes a light approach to ripeness and oak, letting the freshness of the fruit speak with abandon. Bristling in acidity, it offers a layering of complementary dark cherry, huckleberry, pomegranate and cola, before a thick concentration of power peaks on the finish.
This is a light, clear and straightforward wine, reduced somewhat on the nose, and exhibiting a tight, tannic structure and backbone of oak. Black cherry and blackberry dominate in flavor, with a full-bodied feel.
The alcohol comes in just under 14%, but the wine tastes a little harsh and the tannins hint at green tea flavors. The fruit is subdued, dark, a little smoky, peppery and very herbal. This definitely needs to be decanted.
Anas-Cëtta is an irresistible wine for those who seek little-known, offbeat grape varieties. Made from 100% Nascetta (a native grape vinified by a handful of producers), this is a bold, powerful wine with the heft and natural alcohol to cut through cream or cheese. It brightens the palate with stone fruit and citrus flavors.
Stalky raspberry aromas, a zesty palate and salty red-plum flavors are the bulk of this lightweight specimen. Overall it's fresh and snappy, a bit sour and herbal, and not all that substantive.
Although 2006 has been replaced by 2007, this is a well-oiled wine with nice green-fruit aromas backed by hints of pineapple and lime. The palate shows a wealth of lime, lemon and fresh cucumber, while the mouthfeel is at first electric before running steady until the end.
Grown in the cool heart of the valley, but in a hot vintage, this beautifully ripe Pinot combines fruity power with elegant harmony to produce a delicious, complex wine. It's sturdy in acids and tannins, and bone dry. While the alcohol is high, it feels balanced and graceful. Best in its youthful flamboyance.
Initial aromas of vanilla wafer give way to pear scents and minerality. This wine has creamy weight but acidic cut and pulse along with melon, vanilla and lightly oaked flavors. Honey, vanilla and a touch of pithy bitterness compete with melony notes on the finish.
This old-vine wine shows signs of rotten fruit, certainly aromatically. On the palate, it is tight with dark tannins and a hard, extracted edge. It is hard to tell if it could soften. This property liess in both the Castillon and Franc appellations. Wine is vinified plot by plot.
This study of a low-yielding clone produced a compelling range of aromas and flavors. The nose leads with iodine, seaweed and coffee scents against a backdrop of tangy black fruit. The palate shows more nori, lavender, black pepper, asphalt and dried blackberry flavor, finishing on a lingering oaky note.
Soft, sweet and a little cloying, with candied flavors of blackberries, cherries and pepper. Okay in a pinch with comfort food.
Like a Sauvignon Blanc in its herbaceous character, this wine is all cut grass, damp hay and tight green fruits. That makes for an initial raw character, tempered by some hints of apricot. It seems to need a few more months to develop in the bottle.
Mostly Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this wine from the cool 2011 vintage is light in color, with notes of raspberries, green herbs and flowers. It's on the lighter side of medium bodied—fleshing out over time—with abundant savory flavors and a firm handshake of tannins. It will benefit from additional time in the cellar. Best after 2018.
Shows pear and citrus flavors, with a soft, minerally edge. Fresh and clean, and just the thing for summertime, al fresco meals.
Zesty lime-skin notes lend vibrance to delicate apple and blossom aromas on this off-dry Riesling. It's steely and focused with acidity, but fleshed out on the midpalate, with intensely ripe mango and peach flavors.
Fresh, primary red cherry and raspberry flavors are punchy and bright on this easygoing Pinot Noir for everyday enjoyment. It's not a complex wine but pristinely fruity, balanced neatly by a crush of cranberry acidity. The finish lingers elegantly marked by fine, feathery tannins.
The wine is broad, ripe and full-bodied. A great layer of wood gives richness along with yellow fruits, a touch of mango and a crisp end of acidity. Drink now.

A credible effort in what was not an easy vintage for Marlborough Pinot Noir, Forrest Estate's 2004 is a light, silky-textured wine with scents of mushroom and earth followed up by flavors of cherry and cola. Drink now.
Very few wineries got Walla Walla grapes in this freeze year, and even L'Ecole, which owns a piece of the Seven Hills vineyard, had to rely on other sources for many of its wines. But this is 100% Seven Hills Syrah, and it delivers wonderful fruit flavors with layers of citrus and tart berries. A green tea streak cuts through the substantial tannins.
With vineyards located in the far southeast of the Bordeaux appellation, this wine is very crisp and clean, this is a fruity wine, packed with green plum, citrus and sliced apple flavors. It is ready to drink now with its bright acidity and lightly perfumed aftertaste.
Nervy and textured, this is a wine under tension. It is crisp with acidity, with lots of bright green-fruit and citrus flavors. This is complex and age worthy, bringing out the intense texture from the vineyard.
Nothing small about this wine. A super-dark, ripe, juicy Zin full of oak and bacon flavors, lusty in every imaginable way, but not for everyone. Aged 18 months in American oak and edging into Port territory, drink this in moderation or have a nap spot picked out nearby.
A blast of fake-smelling clove is the dominant aroma on this sticky Pinot Noir. Clove returns as the singular flavor, while the finish is woody but not toasty or classy. This is uniquely one-dimensional, but in the wrong way.
A blend of 80% Sémillon and 20% Sauvignon Blanc, both grown in Chiles Valley, this wine was 100% stainless-steel fermented. Jasmine and a sweetness of fresh-picked corn show off on the nose, while a wet stone minerality peeks through on the palate. Light and velvety, the wine offers body and complexity, and should age interestingly. Drink now through 2018.
Pungent jasmine and orange blossom take hold of the nose right away, ensuring that this won't be one of those flavorless Pinot Grigios to forget. On the palate, roasted pear and slight toffee tones mingle with lemon-lime acidity, making this wine a nice fit for backyard gatherings featuring shrimp on the barbie.
Sourced from the Dineen vineyard, this is unusually tart, almost sour, and feels thin on the palate. Some citrus flavors combine with a light touch of body powder, but overall it comes through as a very racy, light white wine.
This full-bodied wine is loaded with sensations of fragrant white flowers, ripe tropical fruit, juicy yellow peach and tart green apple. The creamy palate is brightened by fresh acidity and energizing mineral notes. It's well balanced, with more depth than most other Pinot Grigios.
Dry, dramatic and rich, a Cabernet whose authoritative tannins mark it as classic Napa Valley. Beyond that are ripe blackberry, black currant and cassis flavors that are liberally oaked. Needs some time to come around, although you could drink it now with a good decant. But better 2013–2018.
A crisp, caramel- and red-fruit-flavored blend of Castelão, Touriga Nacional and Syrah, this is ready to drink. Produced at Casa Ermelinda Freitas winery, it has a salty edge from the nearby ocean, finishing with plenty of acidity.
Firmly structured, this is a significant improvement on 2007, with the wood kept in play but not dominant. That's because the fruit is so bright, with juicy berries bubbling along, leaving refreshing acidity at the end.
Rich, musky honey and dark molasses lifted by orange freshness combine to make a sumptuous palate pervaded by fresh, pungent and welcome acidity. A play of dark and light, of dried and fresh fruit, with a wonderfully sonorous, musky finish. Lovely now but will cellar for years.

Smoke and custard notes accent scents of wet stone and citrus, while the palate delivers white peach, lime and vanilla flavors. This is plump and full in the mouth, yet still finishes with mouthwatering precision.
This Sangiovese is soft and gentle, with a roly-poly, slky texture. It's a little sugary-sweet in cherry pie filling flavors, with a kick of pepper.
Almost as yellow as a white wine with just a tiny touch of blush coloring, this blend of 60% Counoise and 40% Cinsault shows lychee, ripe pears, watermelon juice, lemon juice and a touch of orange rind on the nose. The flavors are very light, so it's more about texture, with lime juice acidity and pear skin grip.
Medium-bodied and moderate in acidity, this earthy exploration of clove, cardamom and strawberry-rhubarb is complemented by a depth of black tea flavor. A well-composed, structured wine, it stays bright and fresh on the finish.
Rich, round and fruity, this substantial Grenache demonstrates the potential for this grape in Washington. Though winter hardiness can be a problem, in years such as this, where it ripens perfectly, the vines deliver a juicy, full-bodied wine brimming with cherry and brambly berry flavors. Here it has a light dusting of chocolate from aging in mostly neutral barrels.
Crisp boysenberry and black raspberry aromas meet with lthyme, oregano and a touch of caramelization on the nose of this Sea Smoke bottling. Dark cranberry fruit shows on the palate, lifted by anise, pepper and an array of herbs, all framed by a leathery texture. Drink now until 2028.

Freshly cut Anjou pear, crisp apple, hints of honeydew and lime skin show on the nose of this vibrant bottling by Greg Brewer. There is bouncy acidity and a fine-grained, chalky grip to the sip, delivering chilled green-melon and lime-sorbet flavors. It's tangy yet laced with stony minerality and intriguing texture.
There is no question about the richness and structure of this powerful wine. The 2010 vintage has brought that out in every Bordeaux. Here is shows in the rich blackberry fruits, the dense tannins and the general ripeness of the wine. Wait until late 2015 to drink.
Strong oaky and smoky tobacco-like aromas and flavors make this wine dramatic, while a firm, appropriately tannic texture supports the spicy oak as well as deeper ripe black-cherry and blackberry notes. It has a very good combination of strong flavors and full body.
While quite lush and full-bodied in style, this dry rosé offers ample sour-cherry refreshment. Made predominantly from Merlot with small proportions of Chardonnay and Riesling, it finishes on a slightly herbal note.
Gritty aromas of compost, animal hide, burnt beef and leather set up a pinching palate. Like the nose, this Carignan tastes gritty, sharp, foxy and like tart plum. A salty finish with little ripeness is grabby on the way out.
White flower, honeydew melon and lemon aromas meld together on this lively white. The savory, juicy palate doles out green apple, white peach and a white almond note alongside flinty mineral and bright acidity.
A beautiful Cabernet for drinking now, this has softly luscious tannins framing flavors of ripe, elegant blackberry, cherry jam and mocha. There's an enticing herbal richness and the finish is sweetly oaky.
Give this puppy a good decanting if you open it anytime soon. It's young and tight as nails. The wine is dark and closed and tannic and acidic, but clean and interesting. Somewhere down deep is a core of spicy black currant, but it's locked down.
Straw colored in the glass with aromas of green apple, citrus blossom and freshly cut grass, this Bulgarian Sauvignon Blanc has flavors of lemon curd, guava and pineapple. It is medium bodied in the midpalate and has a crisp, clean finish.
Black plum, dried herb, leather, cocoa and floral scents show on the nose of this bottling from the warmest part of the Salinas Valley. Black plum fruit meets Indian spice on the palate, with a slightly funky yeast-derived characteristic.
Inoffensive aromas of crushed vitamins and stone fruits are good enough. This feels plump and medium in body, while flavors of papaya and green melon are dry and a touch briny. A solid finish is fine but doesn't push things forward.
Deliciously fresh and perfumed, this has a white flower aroma, with a clean and crisp line of citrusy acidity. There is a good tang of structure, giving the wine a fine, food-friendly shape.
Thin brambly aromas and wet rubber don't bode well for the mouth, which is thin, tart and dominated by pie cherries and apple skins. A long, starching finish sends it on its way without much charm.
This wine has aromas of cherry cola and freshly picked cherries. In the mouth there are flavors of tart cherry and black raspberry, with balanced tannins and a long finish.

Aromas of herb and red fruit lead to dried out but lightly gamy fruit flavors.
Citrus and apple freshness mark this wine, which is bright and lively while also having some fruit weight. Not for aging.
A nice, lower-alcohol (14.1%) alternative to the world of big California Barbera. This one, from Lodi's Sorelle, has aromas reminiscent of sweet flowers. The wine is juicy and bright, packaged well but suffers from a touch of bitterness on its finish.
Forward scents of white raspberry, muddled cherry, pressed pink flowers and white chocolate suggest this is a ripe and rich rosé. The round palate is surprisingly juxtaposed by a sharp astringency that dominates through the finish.
A very shy, neutral nose opens up into a slender but creamy, fluid and very balanced palate. When Pinot Blanc received such masterful treatment it shows its true pedigree. There is the subtlest hint of smoky oak and a wonderfully woven midpalate and just a few glimpses of red apple.
The cold vintage compromised this wine, giving it high acidity and unripe flavors of green peppercorns, citrus fruits, dried hay and ammonia.
This ripe, dark Maipo Syrah opens with slightly generic aromas of blackberry and black cherry.

What a special wine this is. It blasts forth with the pencil lead, cedar and black currant aromas of a great Bordeaux, and boasts the tannins that this mountain appellation is famous for. You could drink it now with a big steak, but this ageable Cab will be looking quite nice after 2010.
This doesn't appear to be the strongest recent vintage of this wine, but it remains a benchmark for McLaren Vale Shiraz. Hints of vanilla and tobacco leaf add nuance to a mix of berries ranging from red raspberry to black currant, but there's also a hint of bruised fruit and a green toughness to the tannins. Give it some time in the cellar. Drink 2020–2030.

An arresting blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (62%), Merlot (27%) and Cabernet Franc, it displays purity with its herb, bay leaf, earth and cherry flavors.

Very easy-to-like aromas of honeysuckle, jasmine and green tea ice cream show on the nose of this bright and vivacious wine by Dave Potter, one of the forefathers in the evolution of Santa Barbara's Funk Zone neighborhood. A powerful grip grabs hold of the palate, making for a very racy and chalky experience with lots of length, carrying more green-fruit and tea flavors.
A bit aggressive, with blackberry, cherry, cassis and sweet licorice flavors. It's a big, exuberant, fruity wine to drink now.

A to Z playfully colors its screwcap to match the plum cherry tone of the wine, a Sangiovese from the Del Rio vineyard in southern Oregon. Stainless-steel fermented and not put through malolactic fermentation, the wine is loaded with watermelon, strawberries, raspberries and cherry candy. A fairly sweet finish suggests cotton candy. Serve this well-chilled, best drunk alone as an apéritif.
An aromatic wine, full of ripe fruit and with great acidity to balance. It has a touch of spice, pear and crisp apple fruitiness. The texture and the tight minerality indicate the wine is still young. Drink from 2017.
Soft and structured, this wine has an opening aroma of fruit roll-up and spicy leather. With a deep concentration of blackberry and tar flavors, it's an old-school Lodi wine from old vines that showcase the region's prowess with such grapes.
Light chocolate, baking spice, clove—this wine tastes almost exclusively of barrel. There are hints of light strawberry and lunch meat in the aromas. The vines are young and seemingly the fruit has no power or varietal character; the heavy oak and hot finish do not help.

This is a truly awesome Barolo Riserva from the La Morra subzone with gorgeous intensity and purity. The wine is flush with balsam, cola, cherry, mineral, spice and some earthy overtones. The quality of the fruit is very evident in the mouth. Lingering tones of leather and tobacco are folded within the long lasting finish. Put this bottle aside.
Deliciously heady notes of peach and chamomile immediately hit the nose, promising ripeness and aromatic riches. The palate does not disappoint, releasing even more of those wonderfully balm-like, aromatic flavors. It brightens them with wondrous lemon freshness and boosts them with a poised dose of residual sweetness. It's an unusual wine that does not really fit any category but sits in a delicious aromatic off-dry class of its own. The best option with this probably is cheese, but it will serve well as a philosopher's wine, savored on its own. It has enough depth and beauty to nourish sustained thought. Drink 2018–2035.
This Sauvignon has a sweetly aromatic, candy-like nose with aromas of honey, white flowers and stone fruit. The aromatic intensity is wonderful and helps shape a cheerful, perky white with menthol freshness on the close.

If you can get past the acidity, which is pretty fierce, this is a fine, fresh Zinfandel. It's bone dry and rich in wild berries, currants, anise, thyme and black pepper. The tannins are dense, and need rich meats and cheeses.
Cérons, next door to Sauternes, produces a lighter version of those dessert wines. This wine, with its characteristic honey sweetness, is edging toward toffee, the baked apple flavors already tamed by a few years aging. The core of botrytis dryness is now well integrated, suggesting the wine is ready to drink.
Chiaramonte is an easy, refreshing expression of Ansonica (one of Sicily's most celebrated native white grape varieties) that would pair with most fish -or vegetable-based dishes. The wine finishes with cool crispness.

Enticing flavors of juicy ripe pear with creamy, yeasty elements play about nose and palate. A yeasty mouthfeel also characterizes the rounded midpalate.

By not adding sulfur to the wine, André and Michel Drappier have managed to produce a wine with greater depth than most, perhaps compounded by the slight oxidation that gives richness.

Floral aromas, white peach and mineral tones make for a harmonious and elegant sparkler with a pretty, vibrant appearance in the glass. Fruity, nutty flavors add sophistication and elegance in the mouth.

Nothing at all like its Argentine brethren, this one's sweet, soft and overripe, with jammy berry-cherry flavors and a hot, harsh finish.
Although the wine lacks overall intensity, its measured, composed approach is very refreshing in this land of powerhouse wines. Dig deep and give it time to allow for sweet chocolate, black fruit, spice and cherry liquor. The wine is smooth, with chewy chocolate flavors, and excellent length.
There is a bounty of herbally inflected red fruit on the nose of this bottling, with hints of tea, mushroom and pepper, which make for an intriguing but somewhat odd expression. The herbal flavors on the palate are reminiscent of chewing on bay leaves.
Raspberry, black pepper, graphite and the tinge of dried garden herbs touch the nose on this widely available bottling from the Gallo portfolio. Very even yet growing flavors of raspberry, sharp pepper spice and pencil lead make this wine quite straightforward and good in a simple way.
Veins of smoke and nuts lend savoriness to the bouquet of this dry, full-bodied Chardonnay. It's rich, round and easy on the palate, balancing pressed apple and pear flavors with a fresh zest of lemon on the finish.

Subtle lemon hints and zesty freshness mellow a little on the creamy but nonetheless very slender, graceful palate. Elegance and purity are hallmarks here and it is depth rather than power that convinces. Very clean finish.
A hard wine, tough and tannic, and overripe, with raisiny flavors, including some bitterness from shriveled grape skins.

A distinctly aromatic nose tells of honeysuckle while the dry, light palate is sherbety and less defined. Drink this easygoing wine soon, while aromas are fresh.
This New World style of Sauvignon Blanc is ripe, intense and catty in flavor. Very herbaceous, concentrated fruits are right up front. There is no complexity, just fruit.
Aromas of wild cherry, blue flower and a hint of cinnamon unfold in the glass. The no-frills palate offers black cherry, sage and a note of white pepper alongside soft, rather fleeting tannins. Drink through 2016.
Offers sun-warmed, fresh golden apple and caramel aromas. Apple flavors come through as well but the texture is odd, like sawdust and mineral.

A full, dark and meaty style of Carmenère, with rubbery dark-fruit aromas that steer it in the right direction. The palate is chewy and ripe, with cola, black cherry, prune and coffee flavors, while the palate is flush but loses steam fairly quickly. Not a complex wine, but one that's good for light-minded drinking.
Deceptively light in color, this wine nevertheless packs a wallop, with a hefty 14.5% alcohol. The delicate—almost Burgundian—cherries start off buried by oak and alcohol, but after some airing the flavors come together in a pleasant mélange of Bing cherries, maple syrup and caramel, accented on the finish by a touch of black pepper. Best Buy.
The vineyard is far better known for powerful, concentrated Pinot Noir, and this Chardonnay shares those characteristics. It's a big, fruity wine, not showing much finesse, but plenty of sheer magnitude. Brims with tropical fruit, apple, exotic spice and oak flavors that finish dry. Could do interesting things over the years.

From what is now an estate property, once known as the Nugent Vineyard, Winside is brawny and brooding in wild strawberry compote, dark plum, blackberry and an inviting lushness. High-toned acidity keeps it from becoming overly dense on the palate. Strong tannin on the finish reflects a high-tannin vintage overall.

This opens with mildly leafy, murky aromas of iodine and latex, with hints of black fruit. The palate feels a bit choppy and hollow, with an herbal mix of tomato and red plum flavors. It's solid, but herbal and scratchy feeling as a whole.
Rounded and rich, this single-vineyard wine is concentrated without losing a touch of its beautiful fruit. It has a fine balance between fruit and acidity as well as a tense line of minerality and tight texture. Drink this impressive wine from 2024.
A warm and earthy wine with baked dark-fruit aromas covered in a blanket of fully toasted oak. This bruiser, like its brothers, is all-out Garnacha. It carries a stated 15.5% alcohol, and the flavors are of roasted black plum, blackberry and wood. More lively than the reserve-level wines from Alto Moncayo, but still hard, demanding and heavy. 500 cases made.
Ripe, briary aromas of wild berries, plums and earth veer into dark chocolate. Flavors are on the light side, and seem a little soft. An affordable everyday wine to serve at picnics. Don’t be misled by the “Home Ranch” description; this is not an estate wine.
More than 80,000 cases of this wine were made, making it “mass” by local standards. But that doesn't mean it's not a quality white. In fact, everything about it is really good, from the crystalline nose to the ripe palate to the clean, exact finish.

The wine is all about firm structure and dense tannins. It is concentrated while hiding rich, generous fruits. It still needs to balance the structure with the fruit. For the future, it will be a rich wine full of power.
It's safe to say that Gianfranco Soldera's style is only appreciated and understood by Brunello purists. The wines are as thorny and complex as the argumentative, cantankerous man who makes them. For one, this wine has big volatility but the magic here is that those pungent direct aromas translate into bright aromatic vibrancy and buoyancy. In fact, its intensity and the careful balance between acidity and structure is unmatched.

What's so nice about this wine is its balance. All the parts come together, but it is also a big bruiser of a Syrah. Opens with a blast of white pepper, blackberries, coffee and sweet charred oak, then turns richly fruity in the mouth. But that fruit is accompanied by wonderfully thick tannins and bright acidity.
New wood and stalky fruit have combined well in this wine that is well on the way to being balanced and rich. The dry edge of tannins has smoothed well, giving a luscious wine that will develop quickly. Drink from 2017.

The Niven family's winemaker, Christian Roguenant, teases smoked meats, blackberry paste, dark slate, aromatic red cherries and concentratied hibiscus from the nose of this wine. The palate shows plenty of ripe, red fruit, but is made interesting by woody herbs, including oregano and marjoram.

Zinfandel's briary, brambly personality is front and center on this wine, which wears its slightly rustic cloak proudly. It's the quintessential California Zin, dry, complex and peppery, offering a profusion of wild summer berry, licorice and tobacco flavors. One of the great successes of the vintage.
A very good Cab, dry, full-bodied and fruity. The tannins are thick and hard, making it difficult to savor the underlying blackberries, black cherries, blueberries and dark chocolate. If you drink it now, decant. Otherwise, try over the next 4–6 years.
Good price, but a little too soft and sweet for a dry table wine. Shows sugary, pie-filling flavors of pineapples, with lots of vanilla-oak influence.
This vineyard has proved itself for so many years that it's practically a guarantee of greatness. This 2008 is a real stunner. It's so rich and exotic, so balanced and dry, so clean.

This is a light ruby Chianti that delivers nice cherry, cedar wood, raspberry roll-up, cola and some menthol tones. It has a medium structure with a medium finish and soft tannins.
Bold and pretty at the same time, this has oodles of crushed berry aromas. Ripe fruit flavors that recall black cherry and boysenberry come with hints of toasted oak and a silky smooth texture. It's full bodied but not too stiff or tannic, just concentrated and almost sweet in its richness.
Green bell pepper and gooseberry notes dominate this Sauvignon Blanc, although it does have notes of honey and Meyer lemons. It's bright in acidity, and the finish is spicy and clean. For the price, it's a good value.
Sanguine, with a voluptuous mouthfeel, this wine is soft and integrated in chewy sticky tannins that resolve in the glass, and dusty in dried herb. Blackberry bramble adds a fruity edge that finds companionship in the boldly etched fruit.

With 45% Mourvèdre and 35% Cinsault this has turned into a highly flavored and aromatic wine. It has great fruits and a rich texture that has a herbal edge. It is certainly a food rosé and with its up-front fruit, it could do with a few months to calm down. Drink from late 2017.
Overtly off-dry to sweet, but marked by high acidity and a bitterness that dries out the cherry-vanilla flavors, this blush will happily pair with cheeseburgers and buffalo wings.
A very soft-textured wine with delicious jammy fruits that give spice and juiciness. It has a rich feel to it, velvet in the mouth, while the acidity adds just the right amount of freshness.
This winery has a good track record for producing rich, opulent Chardonnays. The cool 2010 vintage was beneficial, yielding a low alcohol wine with extraordinarily rich tropical fruit flavors and bright, graceful acidity. It saw a majority of new French oak, lending it a note of buttered toast, but the underlying wine is so big, it easily handles that weight.
Big, firm tannins frame this wine, blended with small amounts of Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Syrah, Petit Verdot and Malbec. Black olive, black pepper and tar provide a savory density and complexity, softened by earthy plum and black cherry.
What an awesomely complex, deep Pinot.

That's not to undermine the fabulous black and red stone fruit. Drink now through 2010.

A terrific Pinot Noir that's so delicious, you can't stop drinking it, and also shows a wonderful, classic coastal complexity.

Rich, ripe and chocolaty in style, this is a full-bodied yet soft and velvety-textured wine. It's a rich, satisfying mouthful of lusty red from the right bank of the Rhône, made by Laudun Chusclan Vignerons for the importer.
Here's a textbook Napa Cab. It's concentrated in black currant flavors, with the best tannic structure money can buy. Soft and elegant in the mouth, with a long, elegant finish. Could use some individuality, though, as it's firmly in the international style.
Broad, ripe, full in the mouth, packed with soft white fruits and an open structure. There is some wood, the vanilla melding easily into the fruit. For drinking now.

The lingering finish ends on a licorice note. Drink 2016–2023.
This is a delightfully crisp, elegant and lip-smacking wine, that's subtle and easy to love. Lemon peel, apple skin and pear play together well, never becoming distracting, but instead integrating well with one another and the light hint of oak. Food friendly, it's also a great deal.
Herbal red plum and raspberry aromas are jammy yet fresh. This feels a bit scratchy up front, then creamy on the back palate. Flavors of lactic plum and cherry emphasize oak, while the finish is bright but slightly abrasive in feel.
A mix of oak and hazelnut savoriness contrasts against piquantly tart Meyer lemon and grapefruit. Everything is structured around a medium body and abbreviated finish.
It leads with aromas of jasmine, yellow peach and a balsamic note. The palate is more subtle, offering Bartlett pear and citrus lightly accented with sage, mint and bitter almond alongside invigorating acidity.
This Lodi Sangiovese offers smoky meat layers and roasted plum amid a core of wild vanilla and cooked bacon. A bit confused in flavor, this one is a wine for meat lovers and those who enjoy a good cigar.
This is a forward, slightly sweet-tasting wine, with flavors of cherry candy. The up-front fruitiness leads into some drying, astringent tannins, with notes of tea and tobacco.
This wine's spiced plum, underbrush and French oak aromas waft out of the glass. The linear, ethereal palate offers prune, dried cherry and star anise flavors, set against austere, fine-grained tannins and bright acidity. It closes on an espresso note.
Aromas of boysenberry and barrel spice are followed by ripe pleasing purple-fruit flavors. The tannins deliver a light squeeze. It's hard to find the variety exactly, but it still brings appeal.

This tasty Viognier hits all the right notes, presenting very appealing honeysuckle-spice aromas and flavors. It's not heavy or sappy, and good acidity supports the fruit. Finishes long and with a very nice blend of spice and mineral notes.
An overt and attractive toasted-oak aroma leads to assertive, smoky, buttery flavors in this traditional reserve-style California Chardonnay. Full bodied, it pulls out all the stops for a grand expression of pear, toasted almond and nutmeg flavors that are backed by ample acidity.
Melony fruit aromas with a heavy dose of sulfur and match stick are gritty. This is juicy and bright in feel, with flavors of briny citrus fruits and green melon. A heavily briny and lasting finish closes it out.
The kick and acidic foundation of this crianza work in its favor. They balance some of the heavier elements and emphasize the berry core and also the finish. Is it narrow and limited? Yes. But it fits the traditional mold and doesn't disappoint.
This shows clean and polished aromas of crème de cassis, wild berry, cola, ginger and dried mint. The mouthfeel is linear and bright but also firm.
Very good price for a Cabernet this complex and smooth from Napa Valley. Offers lots of pleasure in the velvety texture and rich flavors of blackberries, cassis and mocha. A big improvement over the '06 bottling. Give it a few hours of decanting.
A frankly sweet wine, this has a deep pink color, simple floral and fruity aromas and a smooth, soft texture.
Less flamboyant than the 2010, this is still an excellent wine. It's full bodied, rich and broad on the palate, delivering layers of honeyed apricot and citrus that finish warm, with a hint of caramel. Drink it over the next couple of years.
The light color of this wine continues to the light palate, which just hints at strawberry fruits. Soft, finishing with fresh acidity, this lightweight wine should be drunk now.
Sultry pear and baked apple are the stars. Lemony and creamy on the palate, this offers slight hints of honey and tropical fruit. It boasts a long finish and robust yet restrained oak that should relax in time.

This Anderson Valley Chardonnay is creamy with a caramel-lemon imprint, yet  textured and vibrant with bright acidity. A bite of lime marks the finish.
Northstar's Columbia Valley Merlot nicely captures the silky finesse of the vintage.

Wonderfully aromatic, this sure-to-be legendary wine offers richness, ripeness, and pure yellow fruits, peaches and apricots, all alongside a structured strain of chalky minerality. It is a wine for long aging, the wood spice just becoming integrated, the fruit still in its first vibrancy. But even now, it fills the mouth with generous fruits, and a great finish of citrus.
Aromas of yellow stone fruit and Spanish broom lead the nose while the juicy palate offers mature yellow peach, citrus, pineapple and a hint of almond. Bright acidity provides balance and a crisp finish.
This wine was aged for a few months in barrel, and that woody character is evident on the nose, which shows butterscotch and dusty spice aromas, as well as the palate, which is lightly oily in feel, with baked, spicy flavors of toasted apple and pear. This Verdejo is woody but has freshness and a refined texture.

Creamy, rounded freshness with an immensely savory core of sage, arugula and white pepper make for an understated but seriously delicious white. There is weight and importance here, but it is lightly worn. The spicy, almost salty flavors keep you wanting more.
Earthy aromas of white mushroom and dried roses that are characteristic of Tuscan Sangiovese are what you notice first here. The wine then segues to fruit and spice aromas, although those berry notes are on the mature and jammy side. Fresh acidity and firm tannins suggest a pairing with red meat.
Another of the single-vineyard Pinots from Brooks, this offers spicy cherry, chocolaty raisins, and dusty tannins. It penetrates and lingers, showing a lot of baking spices from its 18 months in French oak. There's a lick of sea salt caramel wrapping up the finish.
A simple Merlot, sugary sweet and jammy in cherries, with harsh tannins and a bizarre slice of acidity.
Beautiful on the nose with sweet notes of honey tangerine and marmalade, Dr. Frank's 2009 Rkatsiteli is leaner than in previous vintages, but bright with fresh navel orange peels and a crisp, clean acidity. Finishes quite long with a delightful orange pith astringency.
A slight note of pear drop plays on the nose. The palate is juicy and vivid with citrus, green pear and some white pepper. Light on its feet, with an energetic force at its core and lovely concentration of citrus and herb notes, this fizzes away pleasantly. This is far too easy to drink and very, very refreshing.
Beginning to mature, this rich wine with its beautiful honey and spice flavors is, as always with Petit Manseng, finely balanced with acidity. The texture is smooth and opulent, its mango fruit cut with lemon-like tang. Drink from 2018.
Straightforward and easy to drink with a red fruit core of plum and cherry flavors accented by notes of black currant leaf and tea leaves. Low tannins assist in the approachable structure, and the finish is clean and juicy.
This intensely juicy, fruity wine is high in acidity. It's dominated by fresh black currants as well as spice from wood aging. It has fruit concentration, but needs time to round out and soften. Drink from 2015.
This is a grand wine with serious concentration and savory complexity to complement its base of ripe apple, melon and mango flavors. Subtle butter, nutmeg and mineral aromas lead to a rich palate, where its smooth and expansive mouthfeel finishes with creamy, spicy accents.
I really liked the past releases of this wine, but the '04 is not in the same league. It's a hot wine, with baked or stewed fruit flavors, and finishes with prickly, drily astringent tannins. Not going anywhere, so drink now.
Moderately acidic with broad appeal, this Riesling deals light citrus, grass and pear aromas and flavors. Zips to a close with an interesting, kiwi-like flavor.
Lavish floral notes perfume this lusciously sweet ice-style Riesling. Honeyed apples and fresh figs burst on the palate, their flavors intensified on the finish with a hit of zesty lemon acidity.
Most of the action is on the outside of this gaudy bottle. However, this light and slightly sweet wine has appley, floral flavors and a soft, easy texture.
Offers up aromas of citrus peel and fresh whipping cream. On the palate, there's a clean scour of mouthwatering lemon and pink grapefruit flavors. Layered and smooth, finishing with a pucker of sour hard candy. Imported by Wilson Daniels Ltd.
A bone-dry, crisp wine, with green pears and only a hint of Grüner's pepper character. Attractive, creamy and fresh.
Weedy and vegetal despite some decent raspberry, cherry and spice flavors. Okay for a big party where nobody's fussy.
89–91. Barrel sample. This is a perfumed wine with new-wood aromas that lend a strongly woody character. The wood buries much of the fruit at the moment, resulting in a hard and dry aftertaste.
Flat stewy prune-like aromas are low on life but not off-putting. This feels wide grabby and tannic, while jammy flavors of raspberry and plum finish chunky and expansive, but also tannic and wan. Drink now.
Apple is about the only aroma you'll find, and after that things run flat, honeyed and heavy. There's heat and a cloying sensation to the finish, which is pithy, sweet and ultimately heavy and slightly bitter.
This classy Cabernet marks a high point for Salentein. On the nose, it's redolent of oak grain, tobacco, vanilla and all sorts of berry fruits. The palate is full, ripe and solid as an ox. Spiced berry, tobacco and cedary flavors finish dry, sturdy and lightly herbal. Drink through 2022.
Grapes had no problem ripening and the wine brims with sweet blackcurrant flavors. Generous oak boosts spice and vanilla, while tannins are soft but molded. This is an early drinking wine of charm and finesse. Drink now through 2003.
Lovely dessert-style Riesling at an extremely attractive price. It yields dried apricot aromas, then turns to honeyed marmalade in the mouth, just loaded with orange-apricot preserves. It's weighty and viscous, with a long, sweet finish. Should last through at least 2016.
Rich and spicy, full-bodied but gentle, this wine oozes ripe pear, vanilla, fig and hazelnut from the nose to the palate to the lingering finish. It boasts concentration yet comes across as dry, thanks to the balance that its bracing acidity brings. Best from 2018.
Some 18 months of aging in new oak have left their mark on this dark, sophisticated and elegant Amarone. This is a beautiful wine with aromas of dark berry, chocolate, cola, mesquite and exotic spice. It shows soft, velvety richness on the long finish.
Fresh and lively, with lemon, fig and tangerine scents that take on a lemon tone on the palate. Crisp, shortish finish. Try with tuna steaks. Drink up.
Naturally low yields in a parcel within the Holder vineyard give concentration and great depth of flavor. The wine is still dominated by acidity, tense texture and a strongly steely character. Dry, nervy, needing to age, the wine has potential. Drink from 2017.
Red and black currants, wild berries and a graphite minerality show on the nose of this attractively priced wine. The palate is a tad sweet, showing dark red fruits.
This is the Left Bank companion to the winery's La Soeur blend. Here the Cabernet Sauvignon is dominant, with Merlot and a splash of Petit Verdot making up the last third. Firm, dark and tight upon opening, it sends up scents of smoke and charcoal, forming a wreath around dense fruit flavors of blueberry and cassis. A young wine, with perhaps a decade or more of life ahead of it.
Aromatic notes of talcum powder and scented candles give this Bordeaux blend from Navarra a light, pleasant bouquet. But the palate is more starching and hard than ideal, leaving a spiky, jagged feel to the wine's raspberry and plum fruit. So rugged and jarring that food is downright mandatory. Ripped but punishing.
This 100% Syrah is a supple and juicy, fruit-laden wine, bursting with blackberry, black cherry and cassis fruit. It is dense enough to add layers of mineral and mocha. Tannins are powerful and smooth, with a hint of green stem and pepper.
This opens with fragrant blue flower, underbrush and cake spice scents. The palate delivers ripe Marasca cherry fruit with savory accents that recall ground pepper and star anise. It's all bound by refined tannins and finishes on a lingering almond note. Enjoy soon.
Light in color, this good-deal wine presents lime sorbet and chalk on the nose. That green citrus persists on the palate alongside salt, sea shell and barrel smoke.
Fragrant and rich, but also with acidity and a tight, nervy texture, this concentrated wine has good potential. A single-vineyard wine, it contrasts richness and spice with a fresher character. Drink from 2016.
Crisp and dry, this is tight with acidity and with red-currant fruit. It is mineral textured, shot through with crisp red-berry flavors and finished with a refreshing aftertaste.
Bright, clean and linear with pretty accents of spice, blackberry, leather and lingering tobacco, Villa al Cortile Riserva is the kind of wine you'll want to pair with a hearty meat dinner. The wine shows velvety, soft texture in the mouth.
Scorched earth, rose, iris, dark berry and clove aromas lead the nose along with a whiff of game. On the firm, savory palate, mint, white pepper, cinnamon and grilled herb accent the wild cherry core. Assertive, velvety tannins and fresh acidity lend elegance and structure. Drink 2018–2028.
This clonal selection is sourced from vines planted in 2002. Fresh and precise, it's tinged with slightly bitter herbs. The cranberry and raspberry fruits set up with ample acidity. There's excellent definition and pull through on the flavors, with a lick of milk chocolate from limited time in once-used barrels.
Very tannic, rough.
It's hard to exaggerate the purity of this wine, which is 100% Cabernet. It startles for the intensity of mountain blackberries and raspberries, and then a firm minerality kicks in, along with the tannins, providing grounding structure. The finish lasts for a full minute. Winemaker Luc Morlet has really hit the jackpot with this dry, spectacularly complex young wine, which will develop for at least a decade.
The faintest hint of pink in the glass, this bottling offers very steely and tight aromas of sourdough bread and tart pluot. There's a flour tortilla touch to the sip, along with warmer white peach, sharp pear rind and racy lime peel. It's very zesty and satisfying.
Concentrated tannins balance this juicy red-berry flavor wine. The wine is still very young, showing its tannins strongly. They will certainly integrate. Drink this potentially rich wine from 2022.
A smaller-production offering, this wine contains a majority of Cabernet Sauvignon with additions of Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Bright on the nose in dark cherry and grenadine, it expresses tight, grippy tannins along with an herbal, sage-like underbrush, structured to the end.
Part of the Lionello Marchesi collection of Italian estates, Coldisole consistently produces quality Brunello with a large enough case production to make the wines reasonably easy to locate in the USA. This expression offers a bright, ruby appearance followed by vibrant aromas of cherry and spice.
This Pinot is dry, silky and simple, with cherry pie flavors. There's a vegetal, green streak that's disagreeable.
Initial aromas of gasoline give way to briny scents of sauerkraut and cider. This is juicy on the palate, with a medium-intense bubble bead. Briny citrus, green-apple and green-herb flavors finish with length and notes of pickle brine, dust and white pepper.
Syrupy thick at first, decadent enough for a king, this rich red is defined by vanilla French toast and blackberry jam aromas and flavors. It finds balance midway through on the palate, veering into crisper red tones of cranberry and rhubarb. Time will help mellow things out. Cellar through 2020.
Made in a very ripe, fruit-driven, jammy style, this Pinot is lush in rhubarb pie, sweet cherry tart, cola, pomegranate and spice flavors. Could use a little more restraint and elegance, but it's a pretty good wine.
Opens with earth, tobacco, briar and nutty aromas. This is now aged to its best state, and while there's still some tannic bite, it's at a straightforward, mature place. Flavors of roasted plum and spice are classy, and the finish is reflective of a fine vintage. Drink now or in the near future.
Not much fruit shows up on the bouquet but there is a bland sense of vanilla and cookies. Feels heavy but with adequate citric acidity. Tastes monotone and lemony.
A fruity style of red, it is made to be drunk young, possibly even lightly chilled. It has soft tannins plus a fine balance between the berry fruits and acidity that go with a warm, ripe feel. Drink now.
Simple juicy fruit, just touched by tannins, but more driven by ripe plum juice and the brightest, delicious acidity.
If you love old-world Rhônes, Sierra Vista is a producer to know about. This blend of Grenache, Syrah, Mourvèdre and Cinsault is medium in weight and easy to drink and love, tinged with hints of lavender, cherry and baked bread.
Mild white-fruit aromas are nonspecific but clean. This blend of Chenin Blanc and Chardonnay has a simple, citrusy palate feel and briny nectarine flavors. A briny flavor quality remains on the finish.
This has ripe and polished fruit, with hints of mint and new wood. A ripe blackberry flavor pushes through the firm tannins, and it should become more rich over the next 5–6 years. The vineyard is situated in the northern part of the Médoc appellation.
A very rich, elaborate Zinfandel, stuffed with briary wild berry, currant and spice flavors, with a complex edge of smoked meat. It's tannic, dry and high in alcohol, which gives it a warm headiness. Drink now.
This is a little raw and acidic in texture, with a trace of underripeness. But it passes the basic Pinot test, boasting a silky texture and good raspberry and cherry flavors.
This is a strongly flavored, brawny, tannic and heady wine. In other words, it's classic Petite Sirah. The variety does particularly well in St. Helena, whose heat brings extra ripeness, but whose cool nights preserve acidity. Varozza's '08 has delicious flavors of black currant, plum, bacon and black pepper; it should last at least a decade.
Powdery and sweet smelling, with an acidic palate propelling pedestrian green apple, lime and orange flavors. Fruity but not very refined, with a tenuous balance that indicates that it should be drunk as soon as possible.
The mouthfeel is linear and delicate with lingering tones of sweet cola, almonds, vanilla and spice over solid red fruit. Silky tannins and ample freshness bring up the rear.
An interesting, complex Viognier that shows the variety's exotic side of tropical fruits, spices and wildflowers, yet maintains a fine balance. In fact, the structure of acids, tannins and oak makes this one of the best Paso Robles Viogniers in recent memory.
Heavy barrel aromas suggest sawdust, while a grassy, herbal accent brings a green character into play. Drawing and a bit high in acidity, this tastes herbal, with a pyrazinic note of eucalyptus. The minty finish is brightened by lasting acidity.
Bold, exciting and unique. Offers wave after wave of crushed blackberries, espresso, teriaki beef, black pepper and cedar, dusted with exotic Asian spices. The tannins are rich, fine and authoritative. Really a beautiful, Northern Rhône-style Syrah, made from one of the appellation's great vineyards. Drink now, with decanting, and over the next six years.
Lean, racy aromas of green fruits and cactus pad announce a pinched, zingy, high-acid palate. Briny, lightly green citrus flavors finish tight and chalky, with raw acidity that you can feel on your teeth and gums.
Lemon peel, brioche and raspberry aromas take the lead on this pale pink wine. It drinks quite sweet for a brut but still delivers enjoyment with its raspberry flavors.
Light and ephemeral, Winery Block comes from one vineyard planted to three clones (Swan, Dijon 114 and Mt. Eden). The Swan predominates, prompting pretty floral aromas of rose and violet before a bright line of cherry-rhubarb kicks in and earthiness rounds out the middle and end.
A tightly wound, tart Pinot Noir, that seems to show a little greenness in the tannins. Sweet grain and a suggestion of Band-aid in the finish.
The alcohol shows strongly on the aromas, along with dried-out fruit. The dark-fruit and herb flavors are light and elegant, with gritty tannins backing them up.
There's a hardness to this Cabernet that comes from the tannins as well as brisk acidity. Dryness accentuates the austerity, but there is a savory core of black and red currants that suggests the wine will do well in the cellar for 5–6 years.
Plum, blackberry and earthy mushroom aromas lead here, followed by soft, balanced flavors of violet, plum and tobacco. Mellow and soulful, this wine will pair well with almost any meat-based dish.
his blend has a spicy character, balanced with acidity and a ripe, full honeyed character. On the dry side, it has richness, pepper and a deep texture that demands aging. Drink from 2017.
This soft and lightly spicy wine has big fruit flavors, a veneer of sweet oak and a plush texture. It's easy to smell and taste the ripe cherry and strawberry accents.
Earthy and spicy, with leather, almond, tobacco, plum and deep, concentrated flavors. The tannins are there, but are very soft. Imported by Zonin USA.
Big, ripe and a touch earthy, this wine embraces dried fruit flavors, full body, firm tannins and broad, mouth-filling texture. Dried plum and black cherry flavors follow toasty, oaky, new leather aromas.
Smooth, creamy and lightly perfumed, this wine is packed with apple, pear and yellow fruit flavors that are topped with acidity. Well balanced, it is ready to drink.
This is Syrah from the far northwest corner of the Columbia Valley, a cool region, whose wines show an underlying minerality. The berry flavors are subtle; this is a mélange of leaf, herb, rock and acid. Still young, the tannins are drying and the wine seems to be entering a dumb phase. Give it plenty of breathing time.
This full-bodied but stealthy and deep wine looks very dark in color. It has moderate ripe fruit and spice aromas, but doesn't really show its cards until the flavors almost explode with boysenberry and blackberry jam, and nuances of wood smoke and dark chocolate hit the palate. It has great intensity, layers of flavor and a nice, lingering finish.
Tomato leaf, red bell pepper and dry spice aromas overrun the fruit, and in the mouth it's rather tart and acidic for the grape type. Flavors of cherry tomato, red plum and green herbs are good but sharp, while the finish features oak in the form of vanilla. More fresh and tart than most Carmenères.
Only red wine can be produced under the Cahors appellation, so this is released as a Côtes du Lot. It does however come from the Château de Mercuès vineyard, producing a floral, fresh and creamed-apple flavored wine. It is now ready to drink.
Maybe it's the Aconcagua fruit, but this is one funky beast. The nose smells of cumin, hummus and leather, while the grabby, chunky body almost hits you over the head as it pumps herbal, rubbery plum and blackberry flavors. A big, awkward wine with a lot of natural power.
In this wine, it appears that 2008's late-season heat spikes got the best of the grapes. The wine has raisiny, Port-like aromas and tastes, with bitterness from shriveled raisin skins. It doesn't offer much pleasure.
A Cabernet Sauvignon-leaning Bordeaux-style blend, this has a healthy dash of Syrah (10%) added to the mix. It brings notes of jammy red fruit (cherry, raspberry) and herbs along with an assortment of barrel spice top notes, with tart flavors and somewhat unresolved tannins.
Absolutely smooth and pleasantly soft on the palate, this has layers of rich fruit, subtle baking spices and touches of pine forest. Moderate acidity and fine tannins stay in the background yet lift the aroma, flavor and finish to a high level of pleasure.
Challenging aromas of roasted beet, horseradish, herbal blackberry and animal hide lead to a meaty dense palate with rock-hard tannins. Flavors of black plum, blackberry and toasty oak are fiery, intense and carry over to a hot finish.
Made entirely from Cabernet Franc, this opens with aromas of green bell pepper, cedar and an herbaceous whiff of grass. The palate offers mature red currants, raspberries, exotic spice, toasted oak, herb and vanilla alongside bracing tannins. It has a tart, drying finish.
Citrus, buttercream, spice and smoke mark this fruity, layered wine. The citrus and spice flavors explode in the mouth, where it turns dry, soft, round, and supple.
Well oaked, so there's bacon, smoke and meaty berry aromas. The palate, however, is condensed, so there isn't much variety or layering going on. Heavy on the finish, with chocolate. Seems exceedingly weighty on the back end.
Chandon's smaller production sparkler, the étoile Brut is 52% Chardonnay, 37% Pinot Noir and 11% Pinot Meunier, with most of the grapes grown in Napa and Sonoma though the wine is given a North Coast label. It has a toastiness akin to creme brûlée, a bite of yellow cider apple and almond that's quite savory and a medium finish.
Tastes just like a cherry coke, with the heat of alcohol and smoky spice of oak. That's a pleasant, even complex mélange of flavors, even though the structure is simple and direct.
Scents of stone and anise lead into pretty floral notes. Clean and racy, this comes across with a pleasing minerality. There's a good leesy texture to the midpalate. The only quibble is that it turns a little bit soft and soapy as it hits the finish.
Sweet, candied and ever so slightly green on the nose, with generic but fairly solid cassis and berry flavors coming next. The feel leans toward gritty, while the finish is of moderate length and depth. Like a million other Cabs, but still o.k. for everyday drinking.
An easy-drinking, overt wine, but an enjoyable one. Aromas are vibrant and springy—flowers, lemon-lime, mineral. The palate offers up fleshy yellow fruit and stony-mineral accents that carry through the finish.
Bring this down to the cellar and let it sleep for at least 5–6 years. It's super-tannic, giving a hard, angular mouthfeel, even though the blackberry, cherry, currant and cedar flavors are powerful. It just wants to throw some sediment and let that mountain fruit shine.
This wine's nose is rather subdued, but the palate comes in with hints of green pear and lemon. Dry, light and clean, with the tiniest bit of enlivening spritz, it's as thirst-quenching as its name (Getränk, which translates to “beverage”) suggests.
A wood- and fruit-driven wine, very modern in style. It has the ripest fruit along with dense tannins and concentration. The style is more international than Margaux, but the wine is certainly delicious.
Made in a rather lean, racy style, the big question for this wine is whether it will soften and flesh out over the next five years or so. Right now, it's tight and citrusy, with a stony hardness that lacks much charm but would suit raw oysters just fine.
Pink in color, a smooth wine, layered in caramel, missing real fruit.
Named after the current generation's grandmother, this wine comes from family vines. It is crisp with the strong mineral character typical of the vintage. The acidity and citrus fruits are up front and ready to drink now.
The first BeckenRidge bottling since 2001, sourced from a vineyard planted in 1978. Fruit flavors are round and supple, a soft mix of cherry and plum, with herbs and earth flavors framing them. The wine fades gently, clean and delicate, with a finishing note of cinnamon.
Though it was given twice as many new French oak barrels as the Estate bottling, this Vintage Select could be its twin. Solid and balanced, it mixes berry, herb and earth components, making for a well-structured, no-frills wine.
This wine needs plenty of breathing time, revealing pleasant hibiscus, rose, cranberry and tart cherry aromas as it opens. The flavors suggest pepper and red fruit, with a somewhat leathery aged character.
This ripe, juicy wine offers blackberry flavors and young acidity. It is developing balance, fresh fruits and supporting tannins. The structure is integrating into the fruit, which will dominate if you wait to drink until 2017. The blend is 70% Merlot and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon.
This Fiano is strangely redolent of pine cone. Fruit tones of citrus and apricot are found in the wine, but they are slightly buried.
Fragrant and fresh, this offers scents of blue flowers, wild berry, moist earth, chopped herbs and a hint of baking spice. The vibrant, supple palate doles out juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry, white pepper and star anise alongside fresh acidity. It's made to be enjoyed young so drink through 2016.
It's cute critter wine with a name that colorfully relates to what's in the bottle. Peach, sun-warmed stone and anise scents and flavors impart a sense of summer, finishing clean and fresh.
Hints of garrigue herbs and bramble add depth to the bright red-berry and strawberry aromas on the nose of this wine. Juicy fruit flavors continue on to the balanced and accessible palate, alongside soft tannins and a clean, mouthwatering finish.
A light earthy, toasted aroma and mostly savory rather than outright fruity flavors mark this medium-bodied, dry wine. The texture is smooth and rich enough to complete a good picture.
This beautiful Italian sparkling wine offers a floral fragrance of Spanish broom, acacia and a hint of lemon zest. The silky, frothy palate delivers white peach, citrus, apple and toasted almond notes.
Light, mellow aromas don't go much beyond green fruits and orange blossom. Round and easy in the mouth, with melony, reluctant flavors of honeydew and peach. Lean on the finish, with some jalapeño heat. Pretty much average for Chilean Sauvignon Blanc.
Fresh, crisp currant and melon flavors, with lively acidity and intense, fresh fruit. This is a delicious fruit salad of tastes, light and vibrant.
Oak, ripe pear and caramel dance to the fore of this wine's bouquet, followed by thick, textural layers of lingering vanilla cream. The oak remains pronounced throughout the glass, giving the wine a sweetness on the finish.
An oak-aged SB, this is a round and opulent expression of the variety with bursting notes of exotic fruit backed by butter, almond and vanilla. It boasts a golden, concentrated color and soft herbal flavors in the mouth. Pair it with halibut fillet in a butter-herb sauce.
Sourced from six different vineyards, this is a broadly pleasing wine, fruity in blackberry and raspberry that veers even into cranberry and cassis territory without getting bogged down. Substantial and lush, it's tightly woven in tannin and savory herb, ready to open itself over time. Patience will reward with more exotic interweavings of vanilla-cola and tea.
This blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon is light in color and offers aromas such as old leather, pipe tobacco, prune and chopped herbs with a slightly dirty, earthy quality. Yet it's lively in the mouth, with tight tannins, fresh acidity and bright cherry flavors.
Enhanced with a bit of Viognier, this wine shows an intriguing mix of violet-like fruit and fragrant juniper on the nose, alongside some game and pepper. Tar opens the palate, but then it evolves toward elderberry jam, coffee and very dark chocolate, with more black pepper and violety fruit on the finish.
A blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, this opens with aromas of red currant, plum, cedar, bell pepper and toasted oak. The palate offers dried black cherry, grilled herb, espresso and vanilla alongside ripe but rather fleeting tannins.
A rather closed nose and tightly-wound aromatics suggest that this will take time to reach its peak. The concentration is there, as is the midpalate weight, hints of smokiness and a tropical aftertaste of pineapple. Try this as of 2016.
A pleasant wine that shows a sweet, spicy apricot nose; on the palate it has an interesting smokiness that works well with the fruit, and although there is a fair amount of alcohol, the fruit just manages to cover it, and the wine moves to a pleasant if not particularly long finish.
Plummy, smoky, chocolatey aromas lead to a richly flavored but slightly heavy wine. The soft, gentle tannins are easy to negotiate. There's a big wad of rich, jammy fruit that hits midpalate, while the finish is juicy and fruity.
For Navarra, this is a fairly ripe Cab. The nose shows baked black fruits, cola, herbs and maturity, while the palate is definitely racy and juicy as the acidity is what's keeping this baby plowing ahead. For New World Cab fans this will seem thin and tart; but given its domain and age, we like it as an Old World throwback.
Aromas of leafy underbrush, spicy blueberry, plum cake and mocha lead the nose. The palate doles out black currant, blackberry, allspice and a hint of licorice alongside robust tannins.
Roasted black olive and rubber aromas set up a tannic and heavy palate with a lot of oak but not much fruit to back it up. Tastes like cinnamon and spice, with middling blackberry and bitterness on the finish.
If you like your white wines fruity and sweet, this one's for you. It has pretty flavors of peaches, honey and spices.
This is an ambitious effort, with prominent sawdust and campfire notes from toasty new oak that lead to a dense palate with muscular tannins and strawberry fruit that carries over to the medium finish. Give this one a few years in the cellar to come together.
Full bodied and earthy, with lots of meat on its bones. Black fruits with a bit of acidic tang control the flavor profile, while the finish is easy, full and of moderate length. Quite juicy and satisfying, with smoke, rubber and coffee nuances. Imported by Palm Bay Imports.
A decent value in New Zealand Pinot Noir, the 2008 Wild Rock displays aromas of bright if somewhat simple cherry fruit. On the palate, this is a medium-bodied, supple wine; the cherry and plum flavors show only modest complexity, perhaps a hint of hickory smoke. Drink now.
Cantina del Pino is a true manufacturer of delight and magic. This pristine, elegant but mature Barbaresco is a prime example of this vintner's exciting potential. Aromas of jammy berry, cola, cedar and smoke are carefully layered and stacked tall. Open in 5–10 years.
Exotic and unusual for value-priced Malbec, with aromas of blueberry and Middle Eastern spice. Feels chunky yet juicy, with good acidity highlighting lightly herbal flavors of plum and tomato. Meaty, round and solid on the finish, with saucy spiciness.
A rough-and-tumble style, full throttle, with throat-burning cherry fruit, chocolate and plenty of alcohol.
There are some good things going on here but it feels like they are struggling to get to the surface with lees notes and alcoholic warmth overwhelming the palate's appealing, creamy texture.
This is firmly, tannic, the product of oak cask fermentation as well as aging. The tannins promise long aging, while the ripe black jelly fruit character brings out the richness of the vintage.
Almost garnet red in color, this off-dry Pinot Noir sparkling packs a punch with an abundance of juicy black cherry and plum flavor. Concentrated but festive and fun, with a candy-coated cherry finish.
A simple, direct, fruity expression of Central Otago Pinot Noir, with ample black cherry fruit and a bit of weight on the palate but not much nuance.
Stemmy earth and dark, savory pine give in to sautéed mushroom and cinnamon in this lean, soft and delicious estate-grown wine. A tension of acidity buoys a backdrop of wild strawberry and cranberry on the palate, ending with just the right amount of weight and length, succulent to the end.
Just a touch pink, this delicately hued rosé penetrates with fresh watermelon and raspberry flavors. Vivid and crisp, it's elegantly mineral and boasts a cool—almost alpine—freshness making it perfect for summer months.
Heavily roasted at first, and then comes a distinct wave of root beer, olive and barbecue sauce. The palate is decent in feel, maybe a little astringent, with flavors of creamy plum and berry along with sweet, candied oak. Finishes minty and dry, like the dust from the gum that used to come with baseball cards.
Enormously aromatic, endlessly complex, this is one of the best Calera Pinots. It feels full and complete, despite the elegantly light silkiness in the mouth, and the crisp acids and dusty tannins that frame cherry, cola, rhubarb, pomegranate, coffee and vanilla spice flavors. Enjoyable now, this wine thankfully strikes a different direction from today's heavy, overly ripe Pinots. Drink now through 2012.
Delicious flavors in this dry Syrah. Erupts with blackberries, blueberries, carob, smoked meat and spices, wrapped into sturdy but fine tannins. Feels a bit too soft, though. Drink now.
Aged in barrel for close to two years, this 100% varietal wine from a classic Napa Valley producer delivers a compelling mix of blackberry pie and chocolate. The flavors form around soft, silky, well-integrated oak and fine-grained tannins. Rich and robust, it discloses an elegance that suggests further cellaring, through 2022.
Estate-grown from a small family winery and entirely Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine is savory in earthy truffle, subdued plum, black cherry and tobacco leaf. A complex intermingling of pencil shavings and cedar round things out. On the palate the generous tannins are sure to smooth over time.
Always one of Chile's more oaky Chards, Amelia offers popcorn, toast, minerality and peach/apricot aromas. The palate is both delicate and high in acidity, with punchy flavors of apricot, peach and orange. Finishes pithy but lively, with forwardness and plenty of verve.
Major-league Syrah from New Zealand? You bet. Tips the scales at 15.4% alcohol, yet never seems hot. Instead, you get a wonderfully balanced wine loaded with cassis and blackberry fruit, but also notes of coffee and ground pepper. Chewy tannins on the finish suggest it could age, but the wine is soft enough that there's no need to wait. Imported by Kobrand.
Light and lemony, with a hint of green astringency. Tangerine with hints of mushroom on the palate run toward a solid but lean finish. Has zest but little roundness. Fresh and crisp, but not the most friendly bubbly.
While initially subdued on the nose, this zesty citrus-kissed Riesling offers loads of lemon and lime vitality. It's crisp and light bodied with a finish that's dry and mineral.
This beautiful Amarone has intense and earthy fragrances of tobacco leaf, plum, licorice and raisin. The opulent palate delivers concentrated black cherry extract, fig, nutmeg and almond flavors. Its big and round but also has depth and complexity.
This wine doesn't hold back from the representative California-style on its rich and strong nose: candied apples, browned butter, vanilla candies, sea salt caramel, browned marshmallow, even some Olroso Sherry tones. Yet the palate brings it all into focus, with bitter peach skin, pithy lime and grippy apricot playing the foil to vanilla bean and butter. It's a bold yet expertly restrained wine.
Made from dry-farmed, low-yield vines planted in 1918 in what was a leading growing area at the time of Prohibition, this brings aromas of burnt orange, mint and black cherry to the nose. It's a smooth sipper, with menthol, toasted oak and cigar smoke emerging on the palate.
Made with 90% Nasco and 10% Malvasia, this full-bodied dessert wine opens with intense aromas of tangerine zest, dried fruit and a whiff of baking spice. The rich palate delivers mature apricot, roasted hazelnut and orange-blossom honey. A vanilla note closed the lingering finish.
A parcel of limestone soil on this estate allows it to produce a small quantity of white wine. Vinified and aged in barrels, this is a soft ripe wine with light toast and lemon flavors. Textured and still young, this will age over the next few years. Drink from 2019.
Its grapes picked at the end of November, this is a wine that plays between dryness and sweetness. Much of the fruit is on the dry side—citrus, grapefruit, green plums—but then there is a sweeter, spicy pear element, which adds to the roundness from a period of wood aging. Give it a few months to reconcile the two elements completely and there will be a powerful, delicious wine. Imported by Michael Skurnik Wines.
All estate fruit goes into this reserve, which was tasted a few months ahead of its official release. It's tight and herbal, with stiff tannins streaked with tobacco and vanilla. Give it another year or two of bottle age, and drink 2018 to 2022.
For a basic Spanish white, this rises above the norm. Lightly candied white-fruit aromas and a medium-bodied palate help this Macabeo (Viura) and Chardonnay blend get going. Flavors of green banana and pithy lime end with tropical overtones and controlled pyrazine-based pepper notes.
A really nice Riesling that sommeliers should scoop up. It's bone dry and high in acidity, making it a natural for food, while the flavors are rich in citrus fruits, wildflowers and that petrol, diesel note associated with fine Rieslings.
Flavors of cracker and toast accompany light raspberry fruit. The wine is a bit unbalanced, and it falls a little flat on the finish.
Smells inviting, with grass, gooseberry, pine cone, smoky and vanilla aromas, and drinks dry and clean, with citrus and fig flavors. There's a tiny hit of honey on the long, spicy finish. Really a nice sipper.
A strong nose of cat pee and green bean leads to pleasing flavors of gooseberries. The high acidity in this wine calls for food, so try it with oysters. Imported by Global Vineyard Importers.
One for the cellar. Shows a dramatic structure of firm, dusty tannins, brightened with acidity, framing complex, long and deep flavors of black currants, cassis, dark unsweetened chocolate, smoky cedar, anise and spices, undergirded by a firm minerality. Best after 2010 and through 2014, at least.
A light, smooth quaffer that'll get you through the summer, this blend of 71% Shiraz and 29% Cabernet Sauvignon boasts aromas and flavors of charcoal-grilled black cherries tinged with chocolate. —J.C.
Round in the mouth, soft and ripe, this wine has a warm, full-bodied feel to it, without great definition or character. Ready to drink now.
This is a smoky, earthy wine that's fully ripe and flush in juicy fruit. Cherry, blackberry and grilled mushrooms find cinnamon and cola flavors as a tart finish builds on the palate.
Broken-down aromas of haystack and sulfur are sketchy. This feels pinched, citric and rubbery, while salty sour flavors fail to suggest any particular fruit. As a whole, not much good is going on with this Chardonnay.
Stalky aromas of burnt hay and rhubarb are not welcoming. This feels edgy and tastes horsey, green and minty. The finish is grassy.
Dark black in color, this bold wine is thick and rich in tannin and oak, with traces of dried herb, red currant and cedar, making it seem more like Cabernet. The coffee-laden finish provides further focus.
Chocolaty and malty to start with, then more meaty, rubbery and traditional on the nose. The palate is round and just right in feel, while the palate is meaty, layered and savory, with juicy acidity and savory undercurrents. Cutting and food-friendly, and very well-made for a $10 wine.
This wine's red and yellow apple and melon aromas lead to broad, fleshy fruit flavors. It's direct and delivers a lot of appeal.

Dark berries, coffee and woody spice start off the nose of this wine, with more concentrated but juicy plum and cherry flavors unfolding in the mouth. Creamy and lush with medium acid and a lively structure. Drink now–2013.
Seems slightly hollow, and finishes with some coarse oak, but the fruit flavors of cherries and yellow-fleshed red plums are pretty and accented by a hint of smoke. Quaffable. —J.C.
Showing a translucent ruby color and a silky texture, this Zin is elegantly structured, with spicy blackberry, cherry and pomegranate flavors before a slightly raisiny finish. It's not especially complex, but it is easy to drink now.

Made in fairly modest quantities, this Merlot bears dark fruit that shows a pleasing, dusty quality. The blend includes 11% Cabernet Sauvignon, which keeps it in the Bordeaux-style camp. Firm and concentrated, it finishes with a tasty mix of cocoa, coffee grounds and Asian spices.
A darker brooding notion of smoke and tar precedes cherry on the nose. The palate remains slender but has backbone and grip. There is depth here and potential. Give this some bottle age: with a little time it will put on flesh. For now it is lithe and refreshing. Drink now through 2022.
Here is a dark, smoky, meaty Syrah, smooth in the mouth and showing plenty of black cherry fruit. The silkiness plays nicely against flavors that are dark with olive, espresso and cacao, and highlighted with hints of orange peel and pepper.
A terrific California blush wine, rich and compelling, with a gorgeous color, sort of a salmon-koi gold. It's bone dry and crisply clean in acidity, with strong, but not heavy, flavors of strawberries and raspberries. There's a dusting of tannins that give the wine a solid structure.
A 100% varietal wine blended from three vineyard sites, this has fantastic aromatics, floral and meaty in all the best ways. Sanguine, it flirts in black peppercorn, game and a density of black licorice, remaining sturdy and firm on the palate in leathery grace. Drinkable now, it has years to go, through 2022.
The color here is a deeper shade of gold and the fragrant aromas are characteristic of a well-made, concentrated Pinot Grigio: honey, peach and Golden Delicious apple ride over a creamy, supple mouthfeel. Fresh flavors include caramel and peach.
Made of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot, 10% Cabernet Franc, 10% Syrah and 10% Petit Verdot, this has aromas that recall black-skinned berries, leather and Mediterranean herbs. The palate is just as lush: black currant, tobacco and baking spice flavors, framed by supple tannins. Enjoy through 2020.

While it's already accessible, this should hold well for another four or five years. Drink through 2020.
Strikes all the right high-end Cabernet notes. Ripe, plush black currant and cassis fruit, lush, soft tannins, balanced acids and a fine overlay of oak all combine for a rich mouthfeel. The quick finish suggests drinking now.
Big and quite tannic, this is a blend of 85% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% Petit Verdot. The combination of Red Mountain fruit and the naturally tannic Petit Verdot is balanced against by the tart, juicy berry flavors and the influence from having aged in 100% new French oak. Nothing shy here, but the floral and citrusy aromatics add a welcome layer of complexity.
Immediately this wine hits you with a strange set of clove-dominated aromas that suggest Russian or Hungarian oak. The palate is hard, lean, grabby and tannic, with forceful clove-heavy flavors that cloud what fruit may be on offer. Finishes minty and clove-like as well.
Aromas of white peach, banana, yellow apple and candied lemon peel carry over to the creamy, rather sweet palate along with a confectionery note. Fresh acidity lifts the rich flavors while a hint of almond gives it a slightly bitter finish.
This is a solid value in the world of Cabernet. Textbook notes of cassis and mint lead the way, framed by supple tannins and dressed up with hints of graham crackers and black tea. This is medium to full in weight, with a mouthwatering, velvety finish that belies its price point. Drink now–2020+.
92–94 Château Giscours. A delicious, fresh wine, with some new wood, good red and black fruits, ripe tannins and some dense character. The aftertaste leaves fresh acidity.
This blend of the Macedonian Vranec varietal with Merlot starts off well enough, with chocolate and red berry aromas, but falls off in the mouth. Some oak, cinnamon, and tobacco flavors emerge but fade just as quickly, leaving a round, low tannin and low acid wine with very little flavor.
The first white wine from this winery, there's a lot of intrigue here: notes of mandarin orange, lime, and dried herbs. It's medium bodied and drinks just a hair off-dry, with tart fruit flavors.
Smoky aromas and layers of tannin and fruit give this wine great complexity. It is smooth, juicy and fresh while also having perfumed tannins and an elegant, lightly mineral structure from the Cabernet Franc. The wine's cherries and red berries are still encased in the structure, allowing it to develop slowly. Drink from 2024.
Drinking sweetly fruity and crisp now, this Pinot shows jammy flavors of raspberries, cherries, licorice and sweet cola. It has good acidity and is clean and interesting. Probably at its best now.
Superripe and jammy in cherry pie filling, raspberry, chocolate, blackberry and lots of oak, this wine has a little bite of raisins in the finish. Drink now–2009.
Powerful on the nose, packed with aromas of black olive, plum and herbs. This is a staunch wine that's 75% Carmenère with 20% Syrah and then Carignan; it is snappy and lively, with no shortage of wild berry and plum flavors. The finish holds on for some time, and overall it is very respectable Carmenère.
Le Cadeau consistently scores well with their evocative and textural Pinots. In this excellent vintage there are layers of earth and spice, sweet sassafras and brambly fruit. It just sits really well in the mouth, not a blockbuster, but complex and lingering, with the sort of creamy finish that invites the next glass immediately.
Tintilia is a little-known red grape from central Italy that is made into wine by a handful of boutique producers. This expression shows aromas of red cherry, soft cinnamon spice and ripe blackberry. It doesn't have long staying power, but it does deliver freshness.
A harshly sharp, rather green wine, with scoury wintergreen and blackberry flavors. Not going anywhere, so drink up.
Cola, cherries, dried violets, iodine and a slight bit of forest floor funk introduce the nose to this top-end bottling from the biodynamic-minded winery. There is quite a bit of aromatic spice on the palate, from wild mint to pine and juniper, all set against a cranberry fruit character. The tannins are light and acidity is just right.
One of Oregon's finest values in Pinot Gris, this offers big, juicy flavors of luscious apple and pear, backed with punchy citrus. The ample acidity tastes of lemon and grapefruit, and a notable wash of minerality comes up in the finish. The blend includes small percentages of Gewürztraminer and Muscat.
Made in a complex style rather than simply fruity, this smells like toasted almonds and vanilla bean. Tastes suggest not-quite-sweet Bosc pears, butter and walnuts. While the texture is luxurious the body is actually light, and the wine is not at all cloying.
Rusticity goes a smidge too far here, without fruit that can handle the harsh tannins. It opens nicely, with pretty berry and cherry highlights, but in the mouth it gets chewy and finishes rough.
Dense and concentrated, this smoothly rounded wine is well integrated and robust in oak and black cherry, a nice representation of estate grapes. With a strong presence of tannins, it needs to breathe before being enjoyed with earthy fare.
Cherry, violet and herbal aromas introduce a tangy, angular palate with sharp acidity. Quick-hitting, fresh flavors of pie cherry, red currant and raspberry finish grabby, with scouring acidity. Drink through 2020.

This eccentric blend of Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon, Petite Sirah, Merlot, and Sangiovese achieves unusual finesse and complexity for a Paso Robles red wine. The aromas are of indeterminate wild berries, cassis, oak, and mint. Tastes very rich, dry and ripe, with gorgeous, sweet fruit, cocoa and spice. Tannins are soft and plump.
Seductive, toasty scents of brioche and pie crust are upfront on the nose, supported by notes of baked apple, orange oil and melon. The round, plush mouthfeel is soft and richly fruited, with just enough acidity to keep it from feeling too heavy. The palate transitions nicely from flavors of apple pie and creamed pear to woody spice. Drink now.
This is soft and rounded, with attractive red plum and berry fruits that bring in acidity and a light tannic character. The wine is ripe, with a dry core surrounded by cherry flavors and fresh acidity. It is not a wine for long aging, drink from 2017.
True to the dense, muscular style of Woodward Canyon's Merlots, this elevates the complexity in a near-perfect vintage. Deep and textural, it packs together concentrated red fruits, preserves and cassis. At first it shows a little heat from the 15% alcohol, but as it breathes open over hours (and even days) the primary fruit gives way to subtle veins of olive, earth, coffee and toast.
This informal wine opens with dainty aromas of black and red berries together with a whiff of baking spice. The simple palate offers fleeting black cherry and raspberry notes alongside the barest hint of clove. It's made to be drunk young, so enjoy soon.
This is just the kind of white wine California needs more of. It's crisp in acidity, with a brilliant, unoaky focus of fruit. Best of all, the alcohol is a low 12.5%. There may be some residual sugar, but the tangerine flavors are so crisp, the wine feels dry. What a great sommelier wine.
Plum and smoke aromas with pure cherry and strawberry flavors. Always the steady value wine, and this one has force and power that makes you take notice. The tannins are a bit large, however, causing some drying on the finish.
A blend of 90% Sangiovese, 5% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Merlot, this opens with bright aromas of woodland berry, blue flower and dark cooking spice. The soft, easy-drinking palate offers juicy wild cherry, cinnamon and a hint of clove alongside glossy tannins. Drink soon to capture freshness.
A sumptuous wine, creamy and nutty, full of ripe apples, touched by yeast. It is fresh and rich, very dry, a toasty character yielding to final crisp, clean acidity.
The soft voluptuousness of this Cabernet Franc-based Bordeaux blend is its most evident feature. It has plenty of staunch tannins, but they're as finely woven as a silk tapestry, while the flavors are dazzling, suggesting black cherries, red currants and hints of dark chocolate and anise. Kudos to winemaker Aaron Pott for this remarkable blend from all around the valley. Drink now–2020.
Pear and apple aromas provide a good opening to this flowery, slightly sweet-tasting wine. It maintains freshness and pop that doesn't last long in the glass. Flavors of lime and melon end with a hint of papaya. Seems as if it's beginning to fade.
The aromas of dark coffee, bittersweet chocolate, vanilla, and black cherry are still locked up but provide appeal. The flavors are textured and full, showing layers of dark fruit that undulate into the distance and display a fine sense of balance.
You can tell from the name that it's a mixture of (mainly) Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah. The wine is deeply colored, almost black, and stuffed with ripe black currant, chocolate and olive flavors enriched with sweet oak. It's a soft wine, but with firm tannins.
A very mineral–textured wine, with a stark contrast of ripe yellow fruits, sweet vanilla and an open final flavor. The wine is certainly packed with flavors, dense, the steely edge likely to soften over the next 2–3 years.
Inky red-violet to the eye, this blend of 55% Syrah, 35% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Merlot has a nose of black cherry and cherry cola. Brisk acidity compensates for powerful tannins, with flavors of black cherry, cassis, anisette and eucalyptus.
A great value in everyday table wine, Quinta da Cortezia's second label offers bright cherry fruit accented by just enough mineral and spice elements to keep you coming back for another sip. A slightly creamy texture is balanced by crisp acids on the finish. Drink now.
Aromas include raspberry, espresso, herbs and spice. The lean, austere palate offers toasted oak and espresso alongside drying, astringent tannins. The wine lacks essential fruit richness.
Elegant, taut and poised, this has enough texture to suggest it needs a few more months of aging. It has a finely wrought character that comes from the mix of zesty acidity and sweet fruit.
Attractive, best-selling Crémant d'Alsace, with its crisp apple and almond flavors to go with the acidity. It is lively, well-balanced, a great value in sparkling wines.
Toasty oak aromas hint at something serious, but in the mouth it's a dud. Banana and resin flavors are all you get, and the mouthfeel is flat as a board. Overoaked and dull.
Made with 90% Perricone and 10% Nerello Mascalese, this hearty wine delivers aromas of red berry, Mediterranean brush, grilled herb and a menthol note. The palate offers dried cherry, espresso, mocha and peppercorn alongside firm but fine-grained tannins.
Smells and tastes like cheap Port, with burnt berry, chocolate and caramel notes. Yet it finishes dry and harsh.
Aromas of blue and purple fruit mix with notes of dried thyme and black pepper. The flavors are tart and elegant, showing a good sense of balance and restraint, with a finish that lingers.
Dark, tarry aromas of baked black fruits lead to a lively, jumpy palate with resiny oak. Roasted berry and hickory-smoke flavors finish with a wave of forceful, dominating oak, leaving a barbecued taste.
A Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend, and what a nice wine it is. Rich in cherry, raspberry, cassis and mocha flavors, but saved from simple fruit overload by good acidity and finely ground, though sizable, tannins. Has the structure to age though 2015.
This lightweight wine is fresh and flavored with limes, pears and a hint of spice. It's edgy but also rounded, with mouthfilling fruit flavors and acidity playing an important supporting role.

In its silver-coated bottle with the “Ace of Spades” logo, this is a crisp, mineral-driven wine, full of acidity and with a bright character on the dry side of brut. Young with layers of apple fruits, it will age. Drink now for the fruit or keep for maturity from 2018. This is one of five Champagnes by entrepreneur and rapper Jay Z under the Armand de Brignac Empire brand that is produced by the Cattier family, in Champagne since 1763.
Don't look for subtlety in this Syrah. It's all about overt, in-your-face ripe blackberry jam, mushu plum sauce and dark chocolate flavors. The wine is dry, tannic and soft, with a long, spicy finish. Doesn't seem capable of aging, as the alcohol is high, so drink up.
Pale in color, this wine shows perfumed aromas of potpourri, wild strawberries and smoke. The palate reveals mesquite and juicy berry flavors that show a lot of delicacy and restraint.
Light and delicate on the nose with lime blossoms and damp herbs, this top-end bottling from Fred Brander shows lots of peppery energy once sipped. The tense palate is more about texture than flavors, yet wet cement, ripe lime, grass and oregano do make flashy appearances.
A kitchen-sink blend of varieties with Merlot (44%) and Cabernet Sauvignon (26%) taking the lead, this wine offers appealing aromas that suggest high-toned, sweet barrel spices, plum and herbs. It's loaded with cranberry, cherry and plum flavors with a rich mouthfeel that keeps the interest high.
Lush and generous, this has a center of blackberry fruit, showing barrel accents of sweet baking spices. Notes of graphite and clean earth round out the finish.
The nose suggests truffle around compact cherry fruit. The wine is nicely balanced, relatively high in acid, and fashioned for elegance more than power. A finishing whiff of chocolate adds interest.
This is a style of Late Bottled Vintage that should be aged. It has great red and black fruits at this stage but will develop a more structured, dense and firm character as it matures. Give this well-made, juicy wine with its sweet black fruits at least until 2017.
This is dry and silky, with enough acidity to provide life to the modest cherry and cola flavors. It's pretty good for the price, because in Pinot Noir, you get what you pay for.
The nose is subdued while the palate shows some apple and yellow-plum fruit. This is simple and fresh but shows a bitter edge and some dilution.
Sweet, rich, dense, very much of its year. At the same time, there is the Barton touch that leaves some fine elegance, to go with the smoky fruits and richness, while acidity gives it a fine lift.
Full bodied, complex, oaky and concentrated, this wine has a broad palette of flavors from spicy cinnamon-like oak shadings to ripe blueberry and dark chocolate. The texture is appropriately and moderately tannic.
An extremely good deal, this wine will keep both neophytes and experts entertained, with aromas of black-plum jam, dark strawberries and graphite on the lively nose. The palate brings pungent blueberry and black cherry, along with crushed black-lava rocks and pencil shavings right down the middle.
Dry and not all that fruity up front, with a blast of oak. The palate shows weight and bold acidity, which pumps up the lemon, apple and pineapple flavors. A bit sour, scouring and sharp, but also cleansing and fresh. Blunt white wine.
Raspberry and red-plum aromas are light and generic. This feels a touch rough and rubbery, with acidity that stands out. Plum and berry flavors taste rustic and burnt, while the finish is fresh but rugged.
Palisade remains principally Merlot, with a little Cabernet Sauvignon also in the blend. Smoky and focused, it's a riot of loganberry, blueberry and other blue and purple fruits. The tangy mouthfeel brings in streaks of coffee and mineral, with a tart, elegant finish.
The barrel toast carries a lightly charred edge, while the strawberry fruit comes up front and center with flavors of sweet pastry. There's a lick of licorice running through it as well, and the overall structure suggests drinking it up now through 2020.
The color of this wine with 11.6% residual sugar is dark gold and the aromas all raisin and dried apricot. Thick and rich, it has a wealth of vanilla and caramel toffee to offer, with a need for cheese.
The cherry fruit that defines this wine is almost too bright, too pure—it verges on being confected in character. Yet it's reined in by a leash of vanilla oak and a reasonably firm structure of acids and tannins. The wine is merely too young at the moment, so give it a few years to mellow and gain complexity.
The fifth generation of the family to make wine at the estate, Oriane Mazeau has created a delicately spicy wine that is lively and fruity. A floral character gives it a lift, as does crisp acidity. Bright, with plenty of flavorsome fruitiness, the wine is already a pleasure to drink.
Green and stemmy, with a sharp cut of acidity, and a cherry medicine finish.
Great freshness and and almost grassy fruitiness join the yeasty autolytic notes. There is frothy liveliness and irrepressible fruit—red and green apple, a hint of pineapple and zesty lemon. This is one for those who prefer their sparklers full of fruit and life. Midpalate concentration makes this robust enough for food.
You'll find this Pinot Noir drier, earthier, tarter and even more tannic than most coastal bottlings. It has flavors of cherry skins, black raspberries, cola, peppery spices and herbs. Drink now–2010.
This wine is deliciously dry and refreshing, with a pretty salmon hue. Made from Grenache, it smells of watermelon and strawberry and is perfectly balanced. Textured and easy to drink, this is an extremely pleasant wine for summer and beyond.
94-96 Barrel sample. Firm, ripe and sweet an opulent wine, that is balanced with acidity that pierces right through. The texture is dense, dusty tannins balancing with hints of wood. Almost a meal in itself, this is a fruity, but definitely chewy wine.
White pepper is already signalled on the nose, on the palate it keeps fizzing amid crushed herbs and yeasty, salty tanginess. The fruit for now remains in the background, but ripe pear is ready to burst forth. This is a quintessential Grüner, full of focus and direction without forgetting the all-important charm. Lovely now but will be even better after 2018.
The Riesling remains the highlight of this value-oriented lineup, and it's now in a pretty floral package. Bright fruit flavors of orange, tangerine and apricot jam abound, with a clean and fresh mouthfeel. There's a hint of sweetness, but not enough to render it incompatible with most foods.
Dark in color, with powerful aromas that lean toward green peppers and green beans. Those vegetal notes are fairly well covered by some sweet oak, however, you can't escape the vegetal taste and smell. That said, the texture is perfect and the mouthfeel just right.
A blend of Syrah, Grenache, Petite Sirah and Mourvedre, this is a full-bodied, smoothly fruity wine for drinking now. It has rich blackberry and cherry flavors, with a hit of sweet, smoky oak.
Grapefruit and other citrus fruits come through the rich fruit. There is power and crispness here, along with a sense of structure from the mineral, flinty character that underlies the fruit. Hold for for 3–4 years.
Really, really dry, tough and tannic, with some cherry, currant and oak flavors. Puckers the palate into numbness. Will it age? Probably not, but you can throw the dice.
Toffee, cinnamon apples and a hefty swirl of smoke arise on the nose from the winery's entry-level bottling. The palate shows caramelized pears, nicely bitter lemon rinds and warm, buttered nut toffee note that carries from first sip to the finish.
Black cherry and dark raspberry fruit blend with background citrus accents, leading into a vibrant but short finish. Drink now; may also be served slightly chilled.
Menthol and eucalyptus dominate over the indistinguishable fruit in this full-bodied, thick wine.
The nice thing is how this wine delivers so much fruit, especially peach, apricot and mature pear. The mouthfeel is creamy and sophisticated but the overall emphasis is on the purity and intensity of the fruit fragrances. Grapes are harvested late, at the end of October, for extra flavor.
This is a very rich Chardonnay. It has complex, lush flavors of pineapples, lemons, limes, oranges and the smoky vanilla notes from 100% new oak. High acidity fortunately provides crisp balance. Almost too much of a good thing, it calls for equally rich fare, such as lobster or Ahi tuna tartare.
There's a light nectarine touch on the nose of this bottling, alongside coconut and Bosc pear aromas and a kiss of oak. It's a tad ripe on the palate, with lemon cream flavors, but compelling acidity, grippy structure and lime pith bitterness all keep it in check.
This wine comes from vines south of the Mont Sainte-Victoire and close to the edge of the Aix-en-Provence region. The cool vineyard site helps the wine keep extreme freshness. Plenty of wild strawberry flavors are lifted by acidity and a refreshing citrus edge.
Aged 22 months in 35% new French oak, this semisweet wine is so rich and luscious it could be poured at the end of a meal to pair with chocolate or chunks of salty pecorino. It smells like strawberries and black cherries, tastes ripe and jammy and has a soft, mouth-filling texture and low acidity.
Here's a friendly, accessible and value-priced rosé that's perfect for warm-weather entertaining. Ripe cherry, plum and raspberry flood the nose and mouth, with a soft dusting of cocoa that adds interest and decadence. The ripe flavors are full and jammy, but balanced by medium acidity that keeps the palate fresh and the finish clean.

Feral and wild, Spring Hill Vineyard lies in the Petaluma Gap where it is regularly enveloped in fog and cooling coastal winds. The result here is a soft, slightly stemmy, earthy wine with balanced layers of cherry, raspberry and vanilla.
This soft and pretty wine offers lovely suggestions of rose and lavender on the nose, leading into a rich texture of bright red cherry and blueberry. An oak kicker on the finish serves as reminder of the 50% new French oak used for aging.
This lean wine focuses more on its stalky texture rather than fruit. It has some attractive perfumes and hints of red fruits that are subdued by the austere structure. Drink from 2017.
With 4–6 months' wood aging, here is a wine that is smooth, ripe, layered with black, juicy fruits, spoiled by an aftertaste of cured ham from volatility.
Wiry plum and green-tobacco aromas transition to red-fruit scents as this breathes. A fresh, forward palate is medium in body, while a mix of spice, green herb, olive, plum and berry notes comprise the flavor package. A tight, juicy palate maintains the wine's core flavors.
The aromas seem a bit muddled, with notes of jasmine and pear occasionally poking through and the alcohol showing itself. It's medium sweet (2.7% residual sugar) finishing a touch bitter.
The Goldert Grand Cru with its stone and chalk soil gives powerful wines. That's the case here with this dense, tense bottling. The spice is intense, rich and concentrated. A touch of acidity keeps everything in check. Drink from 2017.
Ribbon Springs is the principal source for Adelsheim Pinots, so this vineyard selection is essentially a reserve. As with all these limited offerings, it impresses with rich aromatics and a plush mix of red berries, pomegranate and cherry fruit. There's a whiff of chamomile, a hint of animal, and the structure to age nicely through 2025.
A blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Merlot, the Miolo Cuvée Giuseppe has a slightly sherried nose along with flavors of baked cherries, humus and apple pie. Sinewy tannins and black raspberries characterize the medium finish.
Aromas of bright blueberry and cherry liqueur are accented by shadings of spice, almond paste, moist tobacco and leather. Brunello Bramante also shows pretty nuances of blue violets and lavender
The odd name (misspelled on the front label, correct on the back) means beyond the beyond. It's a lightly buttery, nutty take on a relatively simple, yet tasty Chardonnay, with mixed apple, tangerine and honeydew fruits.
Black berry, plum, red currant and cedar aromas take center stage in this fantastic vintage of one of Italy's most iconic wines. The structured, poised palate delivers a great depth of flavors that include succulent black cherry, cracked black pepper and mocha that are energized by a flinty mineral note. Smooth and balanced with polished tannins and fresh acidity, this is already delicious but hold for complexity. Drink 2015–2030.
Has most of the elements of a fine Monterey Chard. Keen acids and a lively, clean finish stimulate the tastebuds. The problem is a lack of fruit. The wine teases with peaches, then pulls back and fails to deliver.
This structured wine opens with aromas of toasted oak, vanilla, ripe dark berry, thyme and a balsamic note. The vibrant, smooth palate offers dried cherry, mocha, espresso and baking spice alongside elegant, fine-grained tannins and still bright acidity. Drink 2016–2026.
Buoyed by pleasant black-plum fruit and healthy doses of licorice and peppery spice, this sturdy, medium-bodied wine may lack a little charm but ticks all the other boxes, ending long and balanced. Drink now–2018.
A full-bodied, very ripe rendering of Shiraz, Mitolo's 2009 G.A.M. offers hints of raisined fruit to go with its notes of coffee, smoke, roasted meat and baking spices. The creamy midpalate and velvety finish make it drinkable already, although it should hold up well for another few years.
Spices, a hint of honey, a texture of pears and white plums—this is a rich, soft wine with a good intensity of taste and ripeness.
Nice and dry, with a pretty acid-tannin balance and enough Cabernet character to satisfy. Shows blackberry, coffee, spice and herb flavors that are elegant and balanced in the mouth.
Made from the same blend as the dry Orvieto, in this version fermentation is stopped before all the sugars are converted to alcohol. A moderately sweet wine, it boasts apricot, honey and almond notes, with just enough acidity to avoid a cloying finish. Pair it with cream cheeses or almond cookies.
Opulent and ripe, this is full of sweet red fruit, with tannins that have absorbed into the fruit. The wood aging acts as support to the rich texture. It is developing well, but could certainly age for four years or more.
With each successive vintage, winemaker Gus Janeway has slowly but surely moved this wine to 100% Malbec. It's a bold step, because pure varietal wines do not have the advantage of filling in holes with blending. But for those who want to glimpse the future of Malbec in southern Oregon, this is a touch point. Delicate, balanced, herbal, mixing a wash of light fruits with nuances of herb, this very drinkable wine has appealing delicacy and verve.
This blend of Sangiovese, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon shows remarkable richness and smoothness. It delivers bright, fresh tones of black cherry and blackberry that are backed by touches of leather and tobacco. It's velvety and taut, not too heavy or extracted.
At first this Chaleur Estate seemed closed up tight and lightly herbal, but grudgingly opened with streaks of olive, chalk, coffee grounds. A second bottle was much brighter, layered with plum, cherry, chocolate, herb, and an impression of pepper. Subtle and sleek, this wine is built to age and needs to be decanted.
This is raw, sour, tangy and loaded with juniper and pine notes.
This Barbera is leathery and rustic, expressing a taste of the Old World with its juicy dark-plum flavor and roasted, toasted accents. It's slightly reminiscent of cured meats and salami, and both would make good pairings.
Winemaker Anna Monticelli spent a harvest at Cheval Blanc in Bordeaux and worked under Philippe Melka at Seavey and Bryant Family. She leaves her own mark on this structured, silky, robust and rich Cabernet, bright in red cranberry and clove. Firehouse Vineyard is on the winery estate and given to floral and herbal notes, both of which suggest themselves slowly here.
The aromas of apricot and other stone fruit are light but pleasing. The palate shows elegance and detail, with ale notes on the finish.
Always a fine value, Barnard Griffin's Merlot is a brightly fruit wine with tart red and purple berry flavors. Tannins are still a bit stiff, but proportionate and ripe enough, with hints of café mocha in the finish.
There's lots of rich, ripe blackberry and cherry jam, dark chocolate and cassis liqueur flavor in this dry, stylish Cabernet. While it's a little on the direct side, and is not an ager, it's a fine value, showing real Napa sophistication.
Soft and fleshy, this Cab has forward flavors of berries, chocolate, cedar and spices, with a touch of sweaty leather. Polished and easy to drink now.
This vibrant wine begins with aromas of apples, stone fruit and mineral. The savory palate offers ripe Bartlett pear, citrus and peach alongside bright acidity. It closes on a bitter almond note.
While demure on the nose, this light-footed Gewürztraminer is pretty on the palate with delicate lychee and floral notes. Its unusually nervous and shy for it's variety, but refreshingly quaffable.
Deliciously perfumed wine that revels in its cool-climate structure and freshness. Black currant fruits and soft tannins follow through with some dryness. A fine, food-friendly wine.
This is a simple, genuine Prosecco Brut with pretty tones of peach and apricot and drying mineral tones. It has a smooth creamy quality with stone fruit flavors on the close.
A delightfully fresh, fruity Cabernet with notes of cassis and cranberry, this is on the red fruit side of the Cabernet aroma and flavor spectrum. The wine's clutch of tannins are balanced out on the vanilla-flavored finish, and the wine's small amounts of Syrah, Petite Sirah and Malbec add layers of vibrancy.
Very, very sweet in residual sugar, with powerful flavors of apricots, honey, oranges and vanilla. A bit soft, but the luscious sweetness is what makes it work.
Doesn't win your heart immediately. It's in your face in acids and tannins. But it is a very fine Pinot worth cellaring. It's rich in spicy, berry flavors, with a silky texture that will only get silkier. Try after 2008.
This full-bodied red conveys aromas of tilled soil, underbrush, plum cake and pencil shaving. The ripe, dense palate offers prune, dried blackberry, clove, ground black pepper and graphite alongside velvety tannins.
Nero d'Avola and Merlot are combined to produce an easy-going red that would pair with grilled meat or breaded veal. The wine is lean and crisp with light berry tones and a touch of charred toast on the close.
This wine is a blend of Grenache (47%), Mourvèdre (38%) and Syrah. It's loaded with aromas and flavors of black raspberry, herbs, potpourri, peppery spices and kirsch. The plump red and black-fruit flavors show an exquisite balance of richness and restraint that carries through the long finish.
Scents of singed orange peel, roasted nuts and lemon curd are promising, but are followed up by rather crisp, ungenerous lemon flavors. There's a silky textural element on the palate and a long finish, so it may yet come around.
Produced by the same team as Château Cambon la Pelouse, this wine is already drinkable. With attractive black currant fruits and acidity, it is gently tannic with a dry core. The aftertaste is juicy and full of fruit.
A dusty cherry aroma turns harsh with airing, setting up a tight, acidic palate that's marked by tart raspberry and plum flavors. Scouring, spicy and peppery on the finish, this amounts to a tight, hard and basic Rioja.
This medium sweet, easy drinker brings aromatic and flavorful notes of pear, jasmine and white flowers.
A nose of lemon and petrol opens into flavors of lemon, pears, petrol and white flowers, with slightly overpowering toast notes. Tannins are a bit stiff for an otherwise bright white that has a slightly tart finish.
Ripe with black currant acidity and layers of firm wood, this is a rich and fruity wine. It has young tannins, bright acidity and a firm, dry aftertaste. Drink from 2017.
This wine's neutral nose includes mild citrus scents. It's tired and bland on the palate, with yeasty flavors, finishing with papaya and commercial white bread notes.
Deep dark black fruit is seasoned in big bold flavors of graphite, dried herb and chocolate. Full bodied and robustly ripe, this wine has a touch of heat to it, finishing in a smack of leather and tar.
Tart red fruit flavors, lightly spiced, reflect a mix of southern Rhône grapes. The tannins are rough and earthy, and the wine turns a bit green and sour in the finish.
A lovely wine, rendered with panache. Bright fruit flavors mix citrus, apricot, peach and pear. There's a winning smoothness across the palate, and a lively kick to the finish. Hints of lemon, tea, honey and candied orange all run right on into the finish.
Creamy and herbal on the nose, with mild vegetal aromas and big but bland black-fruit scents. The palate is big and chunky, with heavy berry flavors tempered by herbal notes. Same goes for the finish, which is thick and hefty but a little sticky.
One big step up from the value level is this classy, succulent Malbec from Odfjell, a winery whose successes far outnumber its duds. Expect opening aromas of toasted coconut, black cherry, mocha and even fresh mushroom. The palate is blazing with sweet berry and plum flavors, and then chocolate and coffee take over on the finish. It's the full package in terms of Chilean Malbec; about as good as it gets. Only 254 cases made.
Round and minty up front, with stylish dark-fruit aromas and a touch of char. An intense wine with deep cherry, toast and coffee flavors. The finish is ripe and moderately tannic, with herb notes and a lot of bitter chocolate. Sangiovese with 7% Merlot. Should age nicely through 2010.
Biancodicaselle from Mount Etna has a distinctly linear and well-defined aromatic quality that recalls nectarine, pink grapefruit, mineral, ash and volcanic smoke. This Carricante-based wine is crisp, clean and very polished on the close and shows the quality of its fruit in a genuine and immediate manner.
This is ready to drink, quite pleasant, though it leans a bit generic in flavor. Light berry fruit comes with hints of cola and a green streak. The finish turns tannic and lets those stemmy flavors abide.
Smells brambly, sour and muddy, and that's a fair indicator of what's to come. The palate is astringent and seemingly acidified, and the wine's core plum and berry flavors are weedy and murky. Not very appealing.
Nice on the nose, this has a leafy note and a mellow red-berry aroma. Bouncy and rubbery feeling, it has easygoing flavors of raspberry and plum. It's candied and rubbery tasting on the finish, but good overall.
This Sardinian white is a ripe, sun-baked heavyweight, but in a good way. Plump, with lemon-curd aromas; the flavors are sweet and sugary at first, but later turn to complex apple, citrus, pineapple and star anise. Great body, but on the low-acid, soft side. Drink now.
A strong streak of pure vanilla highlights the flavors here. The fruit tastes of fresh-picked strawberries. This is 100% Syrah made from estate-grown fruit.
Cruz Alta is a new, higher-end label from Escorihuela, the long-time maker of value-priced Don Gascón. This is indeed a reserve-level wine (with 15% Cabernet and Syrah), and it's ripe, forward, powerful and mildly tannic. And there's lots of oak to offset the dark berry flavors. Finishes toasty and firm, with mocha.
Locked up garden herb and cherry aromas are followed by bountiful dark fruit flavors. It possesses a lovely sense of balance and appeal, with chewy tannins backing it all up.
So much oak on this wine, it's like being inside a barrel. Vanilla, buttered toast, caramel and char flavors star, with a bit of blackberry fruit struggling to express itself.
This rare unclassified growth from Saint-Julien has all of the elegance you would expect, and it balances firm tannins with a classic black-currant flavor. It has dark, structured tannins, with layers of wood and acidity on the fragrant finish. Keep this for many years.
A polished, elegant and delicious Pinot. New, smoky oak frames ripe, jammy blackberry, cherry, black raspberry and orange flavors, with richer notes of chocolate, figs and grilled meat. Impeccably balanced with acidity, this wine should hold and develop over the next six years.
Aromas of grapefruit, orange peel and freshly starched sheets give way to flavors of lemon curd, grapefruit, hazelnut and rose petal in this wine made of 100% Emir, a native Turkish variety. There is a sense of brightness on the palate, and the soft floral finish features a final spray of citrus.
This wine spent three months in 38% new French oak, which softens and adds a bit of barrel-induced richness to the mouthfeel. It remains a fascinating mix of flower and citrus, with lightly-buttered toast and a lush, lemon-custard flavor.
Many of the 2007 Shirazes from South Australia exhibit slightly gritty tannins, and Duval's Entity is a prime example. There's ample concentration and attractive raspberry fruit, pointed up by darker, savory overtones of olive and chocolate. Then on the finish, that tough quality emerges, imparting a hint of coffee grounds. Drink 2012–2018.
Juicy-ripe, with tasty cherry, black raspberry and blackberry flavors wrapped in angular tannins, and with a sharpness throughout. A pleasant, country-style wine.
Smells great, just like Merlot should, with cherry pie, violet, cocoa, cinnamon and toasty vanilla aromas. But it turns shockingly sweet in the mouth. It tastes more like ice cream topping than a table wine.
Tight and dry, a wine that is on the lean side. It has some black currant fruits, some smokiness, its tannins light. Drink now.
A rich interpretation of the Castelão grape, the wine is opulent and generous. It has juicy black fruits that are lifted by acidity. The slight tannins are far in the background of this wine that will be ready to drink by the end of 2016.
Scents of cherry and raspberry sauce unfold on the bouquet, while the approachable palate offers similarly intense, fleshy fruit flavors that are laced with hints of pepper and soft mint.
Ironstone's reserve Cab is getting better and better, the result of attention to detail. The 2005, held back for three years before release, remains a toughly tannic wine, but it's dry, balanced and elegant and contains a rich core of berry-currant fruit. Should develop for the next six years.
A creamy textured wine, with fresh green apples, herbs, pink grapefruit and a fresh, crisp zing. It is full-bodied, intense and packed with fruit.
A sniff reveals somewhat cheesy, salinic red fruit aromas that struggle to keep their poise. The palate is fresh and forward, but it also smacks down with narrowing, hard tannins. Tastes of red cherry and raspberry, while the finish is snappy but short.
Grapey and fruit-powered, this easy-drinking Cabernet drinks like a fresh Zinfandel. Strawberry fruit is at the core, with light details of leaf and mineral. A good picnic wine.
This exuberant Tokaji starts with an enticing nose of orange peel, honey, flowers and toast, and explodes in the mouth with intense, delicious waves of lemon, orange and honey flavors. A perfect balance of acid and fruit keeps the wine fresh without losing its luscious appeal. A memorable wine loaded with personality and excitement.
Starts off smelling vegetal, although with breathing the cherries come through. In the mouth, turns simple in fruit, with a silky texture. Disappointing.
This is the third release of Figgins, a single wine produced by Leonetti's Chris Figgins from his Figgins Estate vineyard. Intensely aromatic, it explodes from the glass with baking spices and deep cassis fruit. Over the course of three days it opened into a sleek, stylish, complex mix of purple- and black-berries, dried herbs, bark, dusty cocoa and a streak of caramel. Long and lush, it's a wine to cellar for a decade or more.
The nose first offers suede and leather before showing some plummy aromas. Smooth tannins give it a refined feel, although the acids keep it on the racy side. Has nice, deep cassis flavor with a touch of cola and spice from oak.
With so few Mallorcan wines on the market, Anima Negra operates in a vacuum. Thankfully the winery excels with this red made from the local Callet grape. Dry, light, spicy aromas of sandalwood, tobacco and cherry come in front of a medium-bodied, creamy and oaky palate. Flavors of ripe yet spicy cherry and plum finish with notes of wood smoke and baking spices. Drink this unique wine through 2024.
Bright and crisp with just a touch of vanilla along with the more citrus character. The wine has red berry fruits, a light structure, fragrant, ready to drink.
Harvested on the night of the new moon (hence the name); this was aged in one-year-old French oak. The fruit stands out, striking for its dense purple shade, its meaty undertones and its pretty purity. It's overlaid with big barrel flavors of caramel and toast—delicious, but dominant. Let it breathe!
Called Vermentinu in Corsica, the grape gives an aromatic wine with wildflower scents. On the palate, it's crisp with pears and red apples that are cut by the squeeze of citrus. Drink this attractive wine now.
This has to be the only blend of Pinot Noir, Syrah, Pinot Meunier and Chardonnay produced in California, and maybe in the world. Dry and tasty as it is, it's certainly an eccentric wine. It shows plenty of ripe raspberry, red licorice and sweet bacon, yet the acidity is reminiscent of Champagne. Drink now.
A unique expression of Chardonnay, this has oxidized aromas of butterscotch and candied fruit, backed by apricot, cinnamon and nutmeg tones. Creamy and rich, this wine has a zesty and bright finish.
In this case, Sous Bois, which is French for “under wood,” refers to the wine's first fermentation in wood. This creates an extra dimension of richness, with a slight sense of oxidation. At the same time, the fruit feels lifted and open.
This mature wine is the top Bordeaux blend from the Malan family estate. With rich, red plum and black jammy fruits, this wine does not hold its big, bold tastes back. But with great, spicy flavors and a layer of dry tannins that appears at the end, it will stand up to rich foods.
Aromas of Bosc pear, apple, diesel and apricot lead to elegant fruit flavors. It drinks just a hair off dry. The concentration seems a bit wanting but what's there is well balanced.
This is one of a range of three wines from different soils. Silex soil is flinty, giving, as here, ageworthy, structured wines. It is dense, powerful and with a range of steely textures that dominate the very crisp, taut and nervy fruits. Drink this from 2017.
Plump, sweet and tropical on the nose, but also not that focused or powerful. The palate is flat in feel and a bit sticky, with vague, candied flavors of papaya and melon. There's even an Animal Cracker quality to the finish. Good but not great.
The understated fruit in this light, lean wine has a character reminiscent of tart berries and sour cherries, framed by balsa wood. Turns lemony and dry on the finish. The crisp acids make it best with fatty meat dishes.
This wine from a prolific Sierra winery is dark in color, ripe and full in flavor, showing blackberry jam, chocolate and raspberry flavors while coating the palate with soft tannins and good concentration.
A lightly pétillant ice wine. Harvested at almost 38 brix, it is not as dense and racy as the ice wines of British Columbia or eastern Canada, but it offers its own pleasures. Here are details of sweet straw, rice cracker, caramel and honey, nicely interwoven and persistent, and never turning cloying or sugary.
This offers aromas of red berry and blue flowers. The vibrant palate delivers tart red cherry, unripe strawberry and a note of white pepper. Racy acidity and firm tannins make this a good match for pastas topped with ragù or hearty Tuscan soups.
Fragrant Viognier aged in stainless steel is redolent of violets, citrus blossom and crushed minerals. This expression is clean, crisp and lean in terms of mouthfeel.
Chris Dowsett makes just a single Gewürztraminer each year, always from Celilo vines planted in 1982. 2010 was the coolest vintage in two decades at this high-altitude site. If you love searing acidity, married to varietal spice, rose petals, lemons, grapefruit, star fruit and gooseberries, you are in for a treat. Fermented in neutral French oak and left on the lees, this could age for decades.
Coffee aromas and some delicate raspberry fruit come up immediately. At first the fruit seems over-matched, but give it some hours of breathing time and it fills out nicely, bringing on sweet cherry nuanced with fresh herbs. The coffee-edged barrel flavors put a frame around the finish.
Rich, ripe and fruit-powered, this retains more of the high tones (and citrus) than the Merlot. It's powerful and young, smooth but a bit chalky on the finish. It's not yet knit together, and I wonder if and when it will do so.
Dark pink and cranberry in color, this light wine is moderate in acidity and flavorful in nutty strawberry and peach. It's made from a majority of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, with smaller amounts of Cabernet Franc, Zinfandel, Petit Verdot and Gewürztraminer.
This is a ripe and jammy expression of Barbera d'Asti that offers sweet aromas of blackberry, strawberry and blueberry preserves. All that mature fruit is nicely balanced by bright acidity in the mouth.
A pretty, polished Grenache, balanced and savory. Shows a Pinot Noir-like delicacy in the mouth, with cherry and red plum fruit, leading to a slightly sweet finish. Drink now for it's freshness.
Exotically floral on the nose, the prettiness of this wine follows through on the palate, salty and high in acidity, with a tang of lemon peel and lemon verbena. Focused and fresh, it has body and weight within that context, ultimately finding a balance that persists on the lengthy finish.
Jessiaume also runs a negociant business, and this Meursault is a good example. With a ripe, full white-fruit flavor, a note of smoky wood and a rounded texture, it is developing well, if fast. Drink over the next 4–5 years.
This soft wine is dominated by tropical fruits as well as fresher pear and apple. It is ripe, brightened by citrus acidity that still needs to integrate. It will be attractive to drink by the end of 2015.
An incredibly peachy, fragrant nose is utterly appetising and inviting with oaky softness. The palate shows the same mild, fruit-forward flavor. While the fruit is plump, the wine itself is sprightly and fresh, on very light feet with a wonderfully soft and fresh texture. Right now, the peachy aroma shines.
Don't let the playful label fool you, this is an impressive, dry wine. Big, very ripe and fruity, it also has a good grippy texture due to firm tannins and acidity that make it appetizing. The color is quite dark, and the black cherry, blackberry and raspberry flavors run deep.
Young now, with unintegrated oak, acidity and fruit. The parts want to come together, but need time. Really potent in cherry, currant, orange zest, licorice, Indian spice and sandalwood flavors that finish dry and intense. Give it until mid-2011.
Too sweet by far, like melted cherry and blackberry jam, with heat from alcohol and a hit of acidity. Drink up.
This bracing, minerally Pinot Gris is perfect for hot weather; racy and crisp citrus rind and fresh grapefruit flavors abound. It's made with organically grown grapes from the estate vineyard.
Cocoa, toast and char aromas are out in front of red-fruit notes. The flavors are generous and full, with fruit and barrel flavors intertwining on the finish. The tannins bring some grip.
This is one of those “wow” wines you encounter on fortunate but rare occasions that radically changes the way you think about a relatively unknown, workhorse grape like Montepulciano d'Abbruzzo. Gianni Masciarelli is a solid and passionate winemaker who has expertly extracted both elegance and complexity: Black cherry, espresso, chocolate and licorice are reinforced by impenetrable concentration, raw intensity, solid tannins and extreme persistency on the finish.
This simple Pinot Grigio offers some amber-golden highlights and aromas of peach, citrus and ash. The wine is clean and zippy in the mouth and works well with appetizers or as a cocktail selection.
This red blend offers brambly-berry aromas and fruit-sweet plum and cranberry flavors. A good wine, but doesn't stand out from other Cab-Merlots in its category.
Marnà is a very interesting and sophisticated blend of Pinot Bianco and Malvasia Istriana (that has seen some oak aging) that boasts a beautiful mineral vein woven through pulpy aromas of exotic and passion fruits. The wine is dense and persistent and closes with a blast of sweet peach.
Sourced from 35-year-old vines, this offers both elegance and structure in a fairly light, nicely composed wine with interesting details. Its berry fruit has a vein of iron ore, and continues with some deft barrel flavors of nougat and toast.
This offers upfront aromas of plum and underbrush, with hints of oak and espresso. The palate is rather inexpressive but reveals black fruit, chocolate and coffee, although its shy on intensity and energy.
Simple and harsh in texture, with wild berry, cola and pepper flavors wrapped into hard, green tannins that make the aftertaste bitter.
A waxy, sour-leaning Chardonnay that's tart in a teeth-clenching way though it might mellow in time with air.
Broad blueberry, black cherry and vanilla aromas show in this bottling from Steve and Pam Lock's eponymous westside Paso Robles vineyard. The mouthfeel is quite full, showing root beer float flavors, ample acidity and present but well-chiseled tannins.
This wine offers aromas of spice and anise, but its flavors are overpowered by tart berry and strong pepper notes. Lacks dimension and elegance.
One of two Tempranillos from Fenestra (the other from Lodi), the Livermore Valley version is bright, tasting of cherry spice, with good acidity. Nearing the finish the taste turns to toasty dark molasses; a nice wine overall.
Brisk, citrusy acidity acts as a lever to the raspberry and cherry fruit flavors, lifting them to bright zestiness. The wine is a vintner's blend of barrels from across the large vineyard. There's a jammy directness that makes it instantly tasty, but it's not an ager. Drink now.
Charred wood notes on the nose and palate lend a smoky, slightly herbal tone to dense, richly concentrated black-cherry flavors. The char subsides substantially with aeration, revealing a well-composed wine that balances power with elegance.
This medium-bodied, pale pink rosé starts off with fruity notes of nectarine and melon, then adds hints of tangerine and crushed vitamin on the crisp finish. This is a nicely proportioned, modern-style rosé at a bargain price.
Marked by deep, delicious flavors of chocolate, blueberries and blackberries, this is a lovely Cabernet to drink now. The tannins are firm, the finish long and spicy. Shows real Napa class.
Lots of oak, vanilla and char aromas, mingled with cherry jam, cocoa and dusty spices. Very rich in cherries, oak and spices. Dry with firm, dusty tannins. Finishes long, rich and spicy. Full-bodied. Young, sappy, needs time. Best 2007 and beyond.
Dusty mineral and candied orange rind lend a savory tone to pressed apple and pear in this surprisingly big-bodied off-dry Riesling. Soft tangerine acidity and a yielding red-apple fruit profile lends a broad warmth to the finish.
Ripe blackberry aromas are welcoming and clean. This features a flush palate that hollows out while delivering generic but fresh black-fruit flavors. A tasty, fresh finish makes this good for everyday drinking.
Concentrated pomegranate, squeezed cranberry and fresh hibiscus juice pop on the nose of this elegantly restrained bottling that also has lots of wet cement and stony character. Once sipped, the body and texture are both quite delicate, but the flavors are strong: straweberry, cranberry, wet slate, sour plum, bay leaf, eucalyptus and sour juniper.
Overtly green in style, with asparagus notes that are too much for this reviewer. It does have some attractive crushed-stone aromas and an appealing mouthfeel, so it's not without charm.
Offers lime, pineapple and mango flavors—even a hint of banana—with bright acidity and hints of vanilla and buttered toast. There's nothing subtle about this Chard.
Hearty rhubarb, cranberry and cherry notes meet with copious spices, from allspice to cinnamon to vanilla, on the nose of this bottling that also shows dust and cigar box. It's boisterous with fresh flavors on the palate, where black raspberry and juicy strawberry flavors are cut by sharp spice and a pine-needle finish.
This is sourced from vines more than four decades old. It's the sweetest of the non-dessert Rieslings from Brooks, with rich flavors of candied citrus, honey and orange marmalade. That said, it's crystal clear, dense, fresh and juicy, and can fill a variety of slots, from an accompaniment to blue cheese, to a wine to pair with fresh fruits and ice cream.
This is Steven Kent's fourth vintage of Lineage, his blockbuster Bordeaux red from carefully tended Livermore fruit. Predominantly Cabernet Sauvignon (65%), it includes 16% Cab Franc, 15% Merlot, 3% Petit Verdot and 2% Malbec. Layered in coffee and herbal cassis, and finely structured, it is an elegant, herbal-kissed, slightly coy wine, enjoyable now with a big meal or ready to sleep in bottle until 2024–2029.
This is a new bottling from Justin, and it's one of its best wines in years. Blended mostly from Syrah, with a splash of Mourvèdre and Grenache, it's rich, ripe and velvety smooth. The wine shows a warm-climate touch of overripeness in the chocolate-covered raisin flavor, which gives it a Port-like warmth. Otherwise, the flavors veer toward blackberry and cassis liqueur.
This is clean and lively, with soft aromas of fresh grass, gooseberry and green melon rind that carry through to the palate alongside hints of underripe mango and kiwi. The acidity is bright and refreshing, resulting in a mouthwatering finish.
Ruby and luminous in appearance, this textbook Chianti Classico shows the best of Sangiovese and Tuscany. Bright cherry and raspberry aromas are enhanced by toasted almond and a fine, silky mouthfeel.
This starts with a strong blast of black olives, leather and blackberry, followed by condensed fruit flavors and a tinge of black cherry. A nice wine with character, but for $80 it comes up short of thrilling.
Impressive and generous, this gets going with full berry and chocolaty oak aromas. The well-structured palate bears lightly herb-tinged flavors of berry and chocolate. It finishes dry, peppery and sturdy as a cinder block. Drink now–2015.
Ripe blackberry, blueberry, graphite and toasty oak aromas make for a dark bouquet. This is slightly rough on the palate due to aggressive tartaric acidity, while flavors of ripe black fruits, cola, oak and chocolate finish with coconut and resiny oak notes.
Here's an organically grown Prosecco with citrusy notes of lime and grapefruit backed by white mineral and orange blossom. The wine is firm and slightly sweet on the finish and offers an easy, no-fuss experience overall.
Dry spicy aromas of dusty plum and tomato add up to a good whole. This Cab is crisp and alert on the palate, with popping acidity that creates some sharpness. Earthy and spicy currant and red-plum flavors finish direct and juicy.
In the limited but challenged world of Argentinean Viognier, this one is pretty good. It's a touch oily and pickled, but that's a varietal trait and a reflection of warm terroir more than a fault. Flavors of citrus, pineapple and mango are solid, while the orange blossom character helps give it lift.
A hulking, concentrated and full-bodied wine, given plenty of time in new French oak, it has a power and intensity that's hard to decipher at first sip. That suggests it needs time in the cellar to coax out its tightly wound layers of blackberry, black plum and leathery tannins. Cellar through 2020.
Here's a sweet and mature expression of Dolcetto with ripe aromas of raspberry, cherry, blueberry and raisin. There's a touch of spice and natural rubber in there as well. Try this deeply ruby-colored wine with pork chops and roast potatoes.
Aged three months in wood, there is a noticeable amount of toast and spice in this wine. That balances the blend of Chardonnay and Antão Vaz, yielding a smooth character of bright fruit flavors blending with warm apricot notes. Drink from 2017.
Despite the rich, buttery, toasty oak notes, this wine stands up to the barrel influence with its strong tropical fruit and pear flavors, as well as its brisk acidity and stony minerality. It's ready to drink now with rich fare like lobsters or scallops.
A nice tarry funk along with dried mint and menthol cigarette scents characterize the nose of this blend of 63% Cabernet Sauvignon, 33% Syrah and 4% Petite Verdot. The creosote sense carries to the palate, meeting with black cherry, dried bouquet garni and quite grippy tannins.
Sourced from 30-year-old vines, this off-dry wine is finished at 30 g/L residual sugar. The layered, textural, dense tropical fruit, dry extract and tart, tangy acidity all work in concert to fill the palate with a vibrant, fresh and long-lasting cascade of bright flavors.
One of the more interesting Cabs to emerge lately from the Foothills. Shows real class, with ripe flavors of blackberries and black currants, and fine, smooth, complex tannins. Could develop for 3–5 years.
This full-bodied red opens with aromas suggesting French oak, raspberry jam coconut and exotic spice. The densely concentrated assertive palate offers licorice, dried cherry, tart cranberry and powdered sage while astringent grainy tannins provide an austere framework. You'll also detect the heat of evident alcohol.
Earthy hints of pollen and crushed minerals lend complexity to honeyed swathes of peach and raspberry in this delicately framed auslese. It's racy and lithe, yet remarkably penetrating through a long finish.
An exciting flagship wine from one of the best producers in Piedmont, this is dark, inky and penetrating. It offers beautifully intense aromas of cassis, dried forest berry, ginger, cola, leather, and cedar. On the palate, it shows an incredibly silky and long quality. Hold for 10–20 years.
Starting with the package, this comes in a lovely, graceful, goosenecked bottle. The wine is equally svelte, buttery and flat-out yummy, a silky, creamy blend of apple, pear, nut butter and caramel. The length, texture and integration of the barrel and fruit flavors make this extra special.
The nice thing about this Frizzante sparkler is its etched mineral tone that gives it backbone and purpose. Also present are well-rendered notes of citrus and lime.
Winemaker Grant Edmonds is based in Hawke's Bay, but sources the fruit for the Overstone Sauvignon Blanc from Marlborough. The 2007 features ripe, tropical fruit—guava and passion fruit—allied to a slightly herbaceous character, and a slightly creamy mouthfeel that nonetheless finishes brisk and fresh.
This mid-level Chardonnay from Columbia Crest has a broad fan base, and is a popular by-the-glass pour. It is soft and plush, the fruit seems to float on a bed of puffy toast. Buttered apples, pastry and a finishing smack of green apple acidity leave you wanting the next sip.
Aromas of clove and spice start this assertive, easydrinking blend of Syrah and Viognier. Forward blackberry and cassis flavors mingle with oaky spice and sturdy tannins. Aromatic and friendly, the wine will pair well with lamb and beef.
This young wine is in your face now with strong acidity, powerful oak and jammy apricot, tangerine and green apple fruit. It's all too much of a good thing. It may be showing better by early 2015.
Made by an Oregon winery from Carneros region grapes, this wine tastes mellow and mature. It has a relatively light color with an auburn rim, aromas that are savory and meaty, flavors like rhubarb and beef, a fairly crisp balance and smooth texture.
The best red yet from a classy new property on the outskirts of Walla Walla. Forward, grapey young fruit shows inviting scents of shaved chocolate, vanilla and fresh earth. The wine has a spicy, tart attack, well-balanced and vivid, with a fruity, refreshing finish that invites a second sip.
Here's a smooth and saturated Chard that beams strong with the Sicilian sunshine within. The bouquet opens with warm aromas of yellow rose, stone fruit, almond and creamy vanilla. In the mouth, it shows rich, full flavors that would pair with shellfish or white meat.
Among the most extracted and thick Brunellos of this vintage, Tenuta Oliveto offers a compelling wine with fresh tones of cherry, red apple and wild berries. There's a slightly thorny or sharp nature to the bouquet that reminds you of sour fruit, blue flowers and underbrush.

Appealing aromas of mature pear, crushed stone and a hint of grilled herb lift out of the glass. The ripe palate offers juicy nectarine, pineapple and creamy white peach while a hint of bitter almond closes it down. It has just enough freshness to support the rich flavors.
With this wine the Egurens of Rioja fame have hit the mother lode in Toro. The '01 version of Termanthia is outrageously powerful and deep, like a shot to the jaw from Lennox Lewis in his prime. It's maxed out in terms of leather, smoky oak, and depth of fruit. Almost hard to describe, it's so big and mauling. Hold until at least 2008. 330 cases made.
Acacia, beeswax and orchard fruit aromas lead the way on this. The aromas carry over to the ripe round palate along with suggestions of apple and pear.
Apple, lime, lemon and natural vanilla are the aromas one gets from this blended Catalonian white. The palate is bright along the edges, a bit soft and jumbled in the middle, and in terms of flavor the wine offers generic apple and lime in front of a fresh but fleshy finish. Drink immediately.
Similar in style to the higher-priced Cobos wine from the same vineyard. Bramare delivers cassis, plum and berry aromas rolled into a pleasant and familiar whole. Feels rich but refined, with meaty flavors that hit on leather, berry, black plum and chocolate. Spicy and chocolaty on the finish. Drink now through 2014.
This is a generous, leathery and tannic wine, full-bodied and made in a juicy, foreboding style. Black pepper, leather and cigar smoke provide a sultry, robust edge to the wine, which should cellar well, through 2020.
Explosive. Like the Reserve Fumé on steroids. Tons of tropical fruit, persimmon, passion fruit, lime and fig, with rich, bright acidity, all seamlessly married to oak. Showy, flashy and flamboyant.
Fifty-year-old vines are the backbone to this firm wine. Mint and smoky wood-aging flavors give a dry, dense character. Underneath the Cabernet tannins and black currant fruit are developing well. This is a wine for the medium-term, drink from 2017.
Juicy black currant and berry meet smoky oak and firm tannin in this approachably fruity, integrated effort from the appellation known best for its dust.
Deep purple in hue, with saturated dark-fruit aromas along with pinches of cola and creamy oak. Fairly concentrated for a wine of this stature; for less than $10 you get vanilla and chocolate accents atop youthful, bouncy blackberry. The mouthfeel is plump, and there's a toasted coconut flavor on the finish.
Soft wine, light in texture, some spice and tropical fruits. There is freshness, well integrated into an attractive, ready-to-drink wine. Screwcap.
The Helix Chardonnay is a lush offering of pineapple flavor, plus a leesy, mineral-soaked midpalate that is supremely refreshing. It has terrific acidity and persistence on the palate.
Aromas of ripe red apple and pencil lead are followed by tart cherry and cranberry flavors. It's a unique interpretation of the variety.
Named after Jean-Luc Thunevin's reputation as being the bad boy of Saint-Emilion (because he broke into the hallowed aristocracy), the wine is produced from his own vines. It is a rich wine, full of great ripe fruits and dark tannins, concentrated and with some aging potential. Drink from 2018.
This is an interesting bottling that opened up considerably while tasting. The nose displays biscuit, grape and lime notes, and there’s plenty of green apple and sweet-tart citrus in the mouth. It has a nice texture on the palate and closes with a grapefruit tang and chalky notes.
Leather, truffle and ripe black-skinned fruit and herb aromas lead the nose of this enjoyable red. The zesty palate offers black cherry, orange rind and brown spice flavors, with a fine-grained tanninc structure.
This Cab is made in a leaner, earthier style you can describe as food friendly. It has complex flavors of blackberries, black currants and coffee. For those critics who knock California Cabernet as too ripe, this will come as a pleasant surprise. Drink now–2013.
Beginning to dry out with age, with the berry flavors fading to reveal alcohol and herbs. Drink up.
The merest touch of apricot caresses the vanilla and hazelnut notes of fine oak. The palate, on the other hand, conveys power and concentration, held tight and taut by lemon freshness. This will take a little while in bottle to unfold and should entice lovers of Chardonnay with its combination of bright freshness and lush fruit.
Takes a controlled approach to a variety that is often over the top. You'll find the usual exotic tropical fruit and ripe peach notes, but they're trimmed with sour citrus, and the acidity helps maintain balance. Dry and elegant, this wine defines the possibilities of upscale Viognier.
Starting from the nose of struck flint and white grapefruit, this wine sets up as a cheerful refresher. Riper notes of melon and stone fruit creep in on the palate, adding complexity without distracting from the medium body or silky texture, then finishing long and harmoniously. Drink now.
The color of this wine is deep, with a bright ruby rim. Effusive and enticing aromas of spicy cinnamon, toasted oak and red cherry notes meld into black cherry and pomegranate flavors. The balance is just right, the texture is snappy, appetizing and rich at the same time and the finish lingers. Best after 2016.
The Lawrence Vineyard, on the Royal Slope, has proven itself as a source of fine Syrah. This wine does not reflect the quality that the vineyard can produce. It's a thin, tannic wine whose principal flavor seems to be vanilla.
This opens green and herbal, with a disconnected mix of unripe and grapy fruit flavors. The new barrel aging brings toast and butter, but behind that the wine is still disjointed and the fruit flavors all up front.
This wine is living evidence of how Torrontés doesn't take well to oak and aging. The nose is clumsy and heavy, with a resiny note of lemon cleanser. Flavors of pickled citrus and sauerkraut hang around on the finish, which heads south.
If only there was less wood here, the rich Syrah flavors might shine. But at this stage, the high level of toast smothers the rest of the wine. Juicy acidity and fig flavors are under all this wood, and as the wine opens they show more. So maybe in 2–3 years this will be better balanced. Screwcap.
Rubber, mushroom and smoke rise up on the hot, molten nose, while the palate is hard, tough to penetrate and narrow, with dark berry and piercing pepper accents. Tough to dig into and find higher qualities. Thus it comes across as a surface wine without much depth or elegance.
The latest incarnation of this famous Champagne now comes from Roderer's own vineyards, a good portion of which are run on biodynamic lines. This still-young wine has great depth and richness, a beautiful balance between ripe fruit and crisp texture that make it alive, crisp and bright. As it matures, it will deepen and become even more intense. Drink now if you must, but preferably wait until 2019.
Flat early aromas seem smoky at first and then more like apple and papaya. This is a plump Sauvignon Blanc with mouthfilling weight; it's a touch mealy in flavor, and no particular fruits stick out. It's fine, but short on character.
Generous, fruity and ripe, this unpretentious red blend based on Syrah lets the pure fruit flavors carry it rather than laying on heavy oak flavors. It is medium-bodied, broad-textured, very juicy and delicious.
Aromatic, rich, creamy and intense, this beautiful Italian cool-climate Müller-Thurgau would pair with spicy Thai or Vietnamese dishes. The wine is beautifully linear and clean overall.
Deep gold in color, with nut, peach and overt floral aromas. Bright and tropical on the palate, with a soft, almost oily feel; shows its alcohol on the finish. Imported by Foster's Wine Estates Americas.
Buttered toast, oaky smoke and a slight mango tropicality converge for an epic nose on this Chardonnay from a vineyard that was planted in 1976. There are layers of flavor too, lime citrus at first evolving toward brioche with a butterscotch finish, and some salt and cracked pepper throughout.
Palate offers sweet but simple yellow fruit flavors, particularly peach and banana. Finishes with peach pit and caramel flavors. What's here is fine, but better concentration would have merited it a better score.
Salmon pink in color, a wine that is soft and smooth with rich fruits, vanilla and some concentration. It is balanced with acidity while keeping the ripe fruit right to the fore.
This is black in color, and on the nose it's jammy and intense, with slightly reduced blueberry and exotic cumin scents. The palate offers a smooth texture, depth and balance alongside toasty, blackened flavors of berry, cassis and pepper. A chocolaty, lightly toasted finish is a fine ending to this lively, tasty Malbec.
Produced from old vines in the Aegerter Domaine, this wine is dominated by red fruits and spice from wood aging. It is fruity, perfumed and likely to be ready to drink soon. Drink from 2018.
A showy but crisp and fresh style of Chard, this offers honey butter, ripe apple flesh, yellow roses, lemongrass and the slightest show of guava tropicality on the nose. The sip begins with that tropical guava and mango character, then tightens on mandarin orange and lemon rind.
Full-bodied, smooth wine, with spice and black plum fruit flavors packed into the sweet tannic structure. It's solid and chunky, a sign of the greater concentration coming out of Carbonnieux in recent years.
Lakewood hits the mark with this affordable Cabernet Franc. Earthy, attractive aromas of spice and pepper unfold into flavors of raspberry, cherry and more pepper. The wine has depth and weight without being heavy, thanks to a decent amount of acid. The finish is slightly weak but overall, a good wine and friendly.
Fragrant, with aromas of pear, pink grapefruit and wet stones. Similar flavors carry onto the palate, which also tosses out some banana and melon. The finish is thinner than might be expected given the fact that this has a soft, big body.
This is an easy-drinking Pinot Gris, with light melon and pear fruit. It's well-balanced and lively, with modest concentration.
Pears, white rocks, gray slate and lime juice show on the nose of this appellation blend from the iconic Santa Rosa Road winery. Similar flavors also show on the palate, primarily a grippy chalk, more lime and a Meyer lemon pith element, with the faintest hint of struck match in the background.
Great Southern is an underrated source for Cabernet Sauvignon, amply demonstrated by this wine. Expansive notes of cedar, brown sugar, vanilla and baking spices enrobe tart berries, while the wine's firm structure carries through to a crisp, tannic finish. Try in 2020.
Black cherry juice vies with a dense structure in this powerful wine. It has layers of tannins and sweetness. This is a firm, solid wine packed inside velvet. Age for 10 years and more.
The gold tint may look imposing, and it does signal a richer-styled wine. But let this heavier, more ripe Albariño roll over your palate and you'll probably wind up liking its citrus and nectarine flavors but softer body. Finishes with apricot, kumquat and vanilla notes. An interesting wine to drink now.
Aromas of cactus pad, green apple and jalapeño are true Verdejo, while the palate brings citrusy, melony fruit as well as chalky, minerally dryness. Tastes a bit like white grape skins, with tangerine and lemon on the finish.
The baked berry, raisin and vanilla aromas in this Tempranillo and Garnacha blend are a touch soupy. It's tannic and firm on the palate, with tomato, berry and mildly oxidized flavors.
From a different block of the same vineyard as the “Whale label” Memorista, this is drinking much better at the moment. It's smooth and supple—a pretty wine with honeyed minerality around fruit flavors of citrus and peaches.
This wine is immediate in its appeal with aromas of lime leaf, flowers and peach. It drinks off dry with a zing of acidity that beautifully frames the full-fruit flavors.
This is a wine to watch as it develops slowly. It is all structure, concentrated and solid. Dense tannins vie with the black-currant fruits from the high proportion of Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend. Drink this wine from 2024.
Ravan is the local Slovenian name for the Friulano grape. This tasty wine is medium gold to dark straw in color with aromas of honeysuckle, passion fruit and freshly baked apple pie. The finish is pleasantly astringent with lingering flavors of hazelnut. It's perfect to pair with game birds such as duck or quail.
From Crete, this wine offers deep fruit character and an exotic spin on Assyrtiko. Limestone, lemon and white fruits abound, with a slightly sweet and lush finish. Very pretty and balanced.
A wine club selection, this pure Malbec is fragrant and streaked with well-defined layers of blackberry, dark chocolate and earth. There's a pleasing whiff of sandalwood and baking spice that carries through to the finish.
Shows ripe, briary, almost Zinfandel-like wild berry, raisin, cocoa and spice flavors wrapped into sturdy tannins that lead to a dry, peppery finish. Not particularly Cabernet-esque, but a robust wine for barbecue.
Smoke, pepper, red fruit and vanilla aromas. Tastes dark and earthy, with powerful accents of earth, oak and mushroom atop the plum fruit. Smooth, fine tannins on the palate; pure, taut plum fruit at the close.
Notes of fresh savory herb and black pepper spice up the plum, cherry and blueberry fruit center of this wine. A blend of 60% Merlot, 30% Carignan and 10% Petit Verdot, this medium-weight selection offers a rich, fruit-driven palate with approachable tannins and a solid finish.
Way too sweet for a table wine that's supposed to be dry. Almost like a dessert wine, with sugary cherry and raspberry flavors.
Here's a more serious Provence rosé, with a nice mineral streak and good depth of flavor. There's red berry fruit upfront that turns a bit confected in the mouth, winding down to a taffy note on the short-to-medium finish. Perfect with a meal of grilled fish.
You can tell a Dal Forno wine a mile away thanks to the overall intensity and concentration of his well-crafted blends. Three years of oak aging has shaped aromas of Spanish cedar, chocolate, cola, blackberry jam and cherry liqueur. The wine is so thick, it moves like molasses in the glass.
The aromas of herbs, pink grapefruit and guava don't seem entirely knitted together on this young wine. It's dry and fleshy in feel but doesn't have the concentration to bring it all together.
Once you get beyond the billowing violet and gardenia notes on the nose and palate, you're likely to find a surprisingly delicate sip that's bright with lime-juice acidity and honeyed pineapple and hibiscus-nectar flavors.
Dense boysenberry and peppery spice aromas are enhanced with chocolate cake and mint elements on this nose of this cool climate bottling by Adam Lee. There is lots of energy and brightness on the palate, with jammy blackberry fruits, licorice spice, black pepper verve and a touch of tar.
A high-toned nose makes earthy yeast notes seem more heady than they are. The palate is frothy and almost austere, with a slightly bitter edge softened by dosage.
A rustic, earthy and soft Zinfandel that's priced attractively. It has the right amount of blackberry fruit and fistfuls of bacon and toasty oak.
This opens with an alluring floral fragrance of yellow rose, acacia and beeswax. The linear palate offers lemon, apple and pear flavors, along with Verdicchio's hallmark of bright acidity.
Blakeslee brings a wine with pinpoint aromas of beet root, ripe strawberries and accents of Dr Pepper and clove. Young and tart, it remains compact but shows an elegant profile, with the promise of further development. Drink now through 2030.
The impressively plump and prominent strawberry and red-currant aromas are alluring on the nose, enhanced by touches of cinnamon and pepper dust. The palate combines savory pepper spice, red plums and berries, with a solidly simmering acidity shimmering through the entire sip.
Distinctly lime-scented, almost like lime soap, and slightly sweet. There's a clean crispness that reduces the impression of sugar, and a lingering flavor of lime and orange. Like so many inexpensive Italian sparklers, this is flavorful party wine that goes down easy.
Attractive scents of whole clove and cinnamon stick add depth to the black fruit core of this wine. Lush, ripe flavors of blackberry, boysenberry and cassis flood the medium-weight palate, with medium tannins and notes of cigar box and licorice that remain through the medium-length finish.

This zesty red has pretty aromas that suggest small red berry, blue flower and a whiff of moist soil. The vibrant palate offers sour cherry, pomegranate and a hint of anise alongside zesty acidity and refined tannins.
This Rocks District offering has aromas of black pepper and stems, seeming a bit locked up at the moment. Flavors are palate-staining with smoked meat and assorted herbs along with a lightly tacky feel.
Herbal, slightly leafy and roasted on the nose. Feels solid, juicy and a touch creamy from the oak treatment, with a spicy, quick-fading palate housing standard raspberry and plum flavors. Shows acidic scour, spice and modest fruit on the finish.

Sharp, punchy aromas of citrus, green herbs and celery lead to a tight drawing palate. This tastes feline, bitter and a bit like passion fruit. Pyrazine-based green flavors of thyme and scallion drive the finish.
Neutral smelling, with mild apple and briney aromas. Feels heavy, flat and on the thick side, with average flavors of melon but little to no citrus or smack. Melony, soft and bitter on the finish.
Full-bodied wine with ripe pear and red apple flavors, laced with delicate acidity. It's an elegant wine, a fine balance with a more mineral, tight texture as a counterpoint. Drink from 2014.
Forest berry and white cherry aromas are followed by slightly green notes of chopped sage or rosemary. This simple wine sports a lean mouthfeel, with a crisp but short finish.
Roasted, gamy aromas are slightly cool, reedy and herbal. This wine is jammy and deep on the palate, with black-fruit flavors aided by gamy notes, spice and exotic herbs. A deep finish with bold acidity solidifies the wine's excellence. Drink through 2024; contains 15% Malbec.
A solid effort, this basic red blend features mint accents layered over slightly herbal cassis aromas and flavors. It's medium-bodied, with silky tannins on the finish. Drink now.
The neglected red grape from the Dão, Jaen offers dark color, solid and chunky fruit, very ripe with powerful acidity, earthy flavors and a dense tannic coating. Powerful and concentrated.
A rich berry aroma and a touch of leafy tomato mark the bouquet. Healthy in feel, this has perky acidity and flavors of red plums, mixed herbs, earth and cola. Dry, juicy and solid on the finish.
There is both weight and that ineffable Chambolle magic here, giving the wine balance, ripeness and a whisper of freshness. The possibility of aging is here, from the tannins, but the wine is already, appropriately, a charmer to drink.
The addition of some Zinfandel to the Syrah, Grenache and Petite Sirah gives the wine firm tannins and a Zinny pepperiness. Otherwise, it's a fairly standard, warm climate red wine ripe in blackberries, prunes and chocolate.
With its light color and cool feel, this well-balanced wine comes from a parcel of 30-year-old vines. The smoky tannins and intense acidity give a wine that will develop well and slowly. It's still young with its red-berry fruits and fresh aftertaste. Drink from 2018.
This reliable Luberon producer has quietly turned out another good value. An understated, medium-bodied white from the Luberon, this Roussanne offers modest pear elements intertwined with attractive musky-spicy notes. Drink it over the next year or so.
The Beaux is Walter Dacon's American-oaked Syrah, from a range of vineyards and AVAs. The oak is much in evidence, adding vanilla and pickle barrel flavors to the ripe, hefty (14.8% alcohol) grapes. Fruit flavors are blocky and ripe, plum and cherry bordering on raisin; and there is a lush streak of chocolate in the finish. This is a wide- open, forward and powerful style that will have great appeal to some palates. Drink up; don't cellar.
This LBV from the Bulas family vineyards, downriver from Pinhão is all ready to drink. It is fruity with just the right amount of structure. Fresh berry fruits are lifted by fine acidity and well integrated into the smooth, just tannic structure. Drink now.

Huge, rich, flaunting its opulence and ripeness, this super cuvée from Château Lagarosse, powers with black stewed plums, heavy tannins, layers of wood and spice. The acidity saves it from going over the top, but only just.
Chopped mint, new leather, forest floor and spiced plum aromas take shape in the glass. The ripe, juicy palate doles out fleshy black cherry, raspberry jam, clove and licorice notes, supported by big, rounded tannins. It's already accessible and seriously delicious. Drink through 2022.
Unbalanced and rustic, with a sugary, soda-pop taste to the cola flavors. As far from Chianti as you can get.
Earthy aromas include herbal notes, a hint of tomato sauce, asphalt and dusty berry fruits. This has a raw tannic exterior but is softer in the middle. Flavors of saucy, herbal plum and blackberry come with notes of tobacco and olive, while this is drawing and gritty on the finish, with a roasted quality. Drink through 2024.
Bramble and burning brush on the nose, while the palate is murky as it delivers tomato leaf, baked plum and carob flavors. Seems sort of cooked and funky, with a muddled mouthfeel. The 2005 is a cleaner, more focused wine.
Darkly rich, this is a smooth, sophisticated wine that packs a punch of tannin under all its opulent black fruit. From a single parcel of the La Rosa vineyard named for the intense heat there in summer, it's concentrated and dense, with a great future ahead of it. Drink from 2022.
A textbook example of a New World style of California Chardonnay, with high oak and very ripe pineapple pie filling, vanilla-honey and cinnamon spice flavors wrapped into a soft, semi-sweet mouthfeel. Many consumers will love it.
The flavors of this Syrah are delicious, ranging from black cherries and raspberries to bacon, cinnamon bun and vanilla. But it's too soft and simple.
Round, stylish and wholesome on the nose, with wild berry, smoke, spice and not too much obvious oak. The palate is racy and forward, but also offers subtleties including dry fruit, spice, fresh tomato and wild herbs such as thyme and sage. Long and warm on the finish, with vanilla. Drink now through 2015.
This delectable kabinett starts off with amazingly pure scents of crushed stone, lime and apple, then follows up with flavors of strawberries to go with more apples and limes. It's medium-bodied, slightly sweet but with the crispness to balance its sugars. Finishes pristine and fresh. Drink now-2016.
The wine has weight and richness while also showing considerable acidity and dry tannic structure. It's firm, the fruitiness showing slowly through the mineral texture. It will be better in 2015.
Dark and herbal, with solid fruit and texture. This is Merlot from Chile as it should be, meaning it is meaty, ripe, naturally herbal and comfortable. Not a fancy wine, but one with honest cherry, plum, herb and pepper flavors. A little bumpy, hot and oaky, but convincing as a whole. Imported by Baystate Wine Co.
The wine is rich, honeyed and full of ripe marmalade and apricot jelly flavors. At the same time, it has the fine shot of acidity and crispness that gives Jurançon its elegance and individuality. This is delicious to drink now, although it would be much better to wait and drink it from 2019.
Maybe a little more ripe and heady than some of its Chilean buddies, but this SB from Montes offers freshness, zip and good citrus, tarragon and other green-herb flavors. The feel is good, the character fresh, and the finish long and clean. Offers maybe a little more green-leaf character than some might like, but overall this is another fine value SB from Chile. Drink immediately.
Named for the number of months it takes to go from grape to glass, Brut 25 is a steely, tonic wine, with bright aromas of citrus, pear and peach.
This is an intriguingly light, lean and savory wine, true to its extreme Sonoma Coast provenance. The color and texture tip one off to its ethereal nature, a blend of shy cranberry, rhubarb and exotic spice. The long finish highlights the flavors and freshness.
An everyday sparkler with a nice toasted nuttiness mingling with solid and persistent baked green apple and citrus pith flavors. The mouth is creamy with fine carbonation and medium acidity. Drink now.
Solid and textured, this rich wine is showing as much tannin as fruit. But its warmth promises a wine with attractive red fruits and a generous future. Drink from 2016.
For Cabernet Franc this is elegant and refined, almost delicate. The fruit is a beguiling mix of pretty strawberry, Bing cherry and currant. Balanced and tangy, with an underlying minerality, this lovely wine is the most distinctive, terroir-driven Franc in Washington.
Col di Manza has it all: It's a vineyard-designate, vintage-dated Prosecco Superiore made with organically and biodynamically farmed fruit. It's a mouthful, with soft effervescence and fruit intensity.
Lazzarito is an outstanding achievement and a wonderful example of the staying power of Barolo. The wine is redolent of sweet spice, clove, smoked bacon, licorice and roasted almond—in fact, it's almost too much of a good thing. There are deep layers here and the wine boasts a soft velvety feel. Drink 2015–2020.
A live-wire wine with baby powder, tropical fruit, citrus and green melon on the nose. Made in the forward, fruit-first style; it radiates with natural acidity such to the point that it's borderline aggressive. But with such power you also get strong green apple and grapefruit flavors. Edgy and citric overall, but at the same time you won't get shorted.
Fenestra's '06 Semillon and Chardonnay both were pretty good, but for some reason, this blend of both flags. It's thin in flavor, with a weedy, minty edge to the citrus and oak flavors.
This Cab Franc has some nice features, starting with the cherry and herb flavors that finish dry and spicy. It's a bit rough-edged right out of the bottle, but the combination of decanting and drinking it with a rich, fatty steak will improve it tremendously at the table.
There's bountiful energy on the sizzling nose of this semisweet bottling, with aromas of baking soda, just-cut limes, lemon rinds and a touch of ripe peach. The palate offers apple syrup and peels, tartness from lemon and lime skins, and richness from flavors of orange water and jasmine.
A strong showing, with tones of blueberry and iodine interwoven with animal and barnyard scents on the nose. The palate shows red fruit flavors with flowers at the back and ends on a leather note. Refined tannins allow for immediate consumption.
Alluring, ethereal scents of perfumed berry, aromatic herb, fragrant blue flower, new leather, orange zest and exotic spice abound on this radiant wine. The smooth, vibrant palate is loaded with finesse, delivering juicy red cherry, raspberry, cake spice and energizing mineral. Silky, supple tannins and bright acidity provide impeccable balance. It's already extremely tempting but hold for even more complexity. Drink 2018–2025.
Huckleberry and dark cherry mingle around a viscosity of velvety texture and tannin, dusted in notions of black tea, tar and red currant. Light in color, but bold in flavor, this wine speaks to both the cool nature of its vineyard site, and to the style of the winemaker.
Dark cherry, clove and cinnamon swirl around each other in this well made, light-bodied red wine priced attractively to please a range of palates. Earth and pomegranate rise on the palate, finishing with length.
Sweet aromas of wet clay and latex give way to spicecake and standard berry and cassis. Feels layered and round, with good density and balance to go with berry, cassis and mild herbal flavors. Holds steady on the finish. A regular but solid Cab for everyday purposes.
This is a delicious and complex white wine, beginning with its aromas of matchstick, hay and hazelnuts. Zesty citrus stars on the midpalate, giving way to more generous, rounded layers of vanilla cream. Age-worthy, it peaks in bursts of orange blossom and tangerine, and would be a lovely partner for some fresh oysters on the half shell.
Consisting of both Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this homegrown effort begins with a suggestion of deli meat and campfire, evocative aromas that persist through on the palate. Toasted oak and a touch of heat follow, buoyed by sizable fists of cinnamon and cherry, finishing in dried herb.
Staunch aromas of leather and animal hide ride heavily on top of rubbery blackberry scents. This feels solid but scattered, with cherry and cassis flavors that come across jammy. Rubbery notes and a mild cheesy oak character dominate the finish.
An attractive and balanced rosé made from a diverse blend of 50% Syrah, 15% Grenache, 10% Cabernet Franc, 10% Mourvèdre, 10% Cinsault and 5% Carignan. There's great lift to the yellow peach, white cherry and wild strawberry fruit flavors, with the creamy mouth closing on a soft white pepper note. Drink now.
This wine highlights heady new-oak tones of spice, vanilla and cedar, yet maintains elegance from nose to finish. Ripe black cherry and plum flavors penetrate on the palate, with a framing of soft tannins and bright cranberry acidity. The finish is long and a touch mineral.
The wine has bold fruit and ripe tannins. There is still a strong flavor from the wood aging although this should integrate. The fruit is the dominant character of this red-berry flavored wine. Drink from 2021.
This is the delightful follow-up to the gorgeous 2003; it's an elegant wine that was not fined, filtered or manipulated with designer yeasts and enzymes. Feminine and truly Pinot-like in its grace and balance, it's a rare—sadly, too rare—instance where Oregon Pinot is much more French than Californian.
With a sweet dosage, this is soft Blanc de Blancs. Pears, hints of apricots go with some crisp acidity. It still tastes young and needs time to integrate, but will always be on the sweet side of Brut.
A nicely balanced red. It's not the richest, deepest wine out there, but it does offer plenty of red plum and raspberry flavors, framed by vanilla-scented oak. It's reasonably long on the finish, too, where the wine picks up attractive cedary accents.
A harsh wine, with cutting acids and a thin flavor of raspberry candy.
A dark, dry and firm wine, this is developing slowly. Its fruits show the influence of Cabernet in the blend with a strong tannic and black currant element. It will need several more years aging, so drink from 2018.
Quite clean, vibrant and forward in cassis and cherry aromas, this generously oaked wine has smooth tannins and is fairly high in acidity. It might soften and improve with several years of aging.
The tannins of this dry, red wine will happily grapple with the fats of cheese and beef, and the acids will match tomatoes. From Delicato.
This is one of the better Temecula Valley wines in recent memory, with dried blackberry, leather, tar and condensed purple flowers on the nose. There's a kiss of herbs upfront on the palate, followed by layers of tangy boysenberry, caramel and salt and pepper flavors. The structure is apparent but not in the way, and the acidity is lively.
This opens with aromas of butterscotch, lemon cream pie and ripe stone fruit. The palate starts off with rich apricot, apple and peach flavors, but it has a very warm palate that's dominated by evident alcohol sensations. It finishes on a bitter almond note.
Clean and vibrant in the mouth, with zesty acidity and brisk flavors of tangerines, Meyer lemons, honey and vanilla. Nice as a cocktail sipper to get the evening started.
There's a slightly aged and distinctive nose of sour cranberry and anise on this wine from the family who's owned San Antonio Winery in Los Angeles since 1917. The cooker fruit sense continues to the palate, where lingering root vegetable flavors and mocha mix with Eastern European spices.
Ripe, loamy aromas of raisin, baked blackberry and earth filter into a saturated palate with bracing natural acidity. Blackberry, cassis, herbal notes, oak and sauciness create a set of integrated flavors, while vanilla and woody notes drive the finish on this pago-designated Bobal from Utiel-Requena. Drink through 2020.
Full-bodied, lush and creamy in texture, this Merlot epitomizes the Marquis Philips style. There's a coating of charred oak, superripe fruit and plenty of size without much acid or tannin. Drink this slightly warm (16.5% abv) wine over the next 6–9 months.
Forest floor, woodland berry and spice aromas emerge in the glass. The tight palate offers sour cherry, white pepper, grilled herb and a whiff of tobacco alongside close-grained tannins and racy acidity. An anisette note closes the finish.
A blend of Grillo, Inzolia and Grecanico, this simple white opens with subdued aromas of spring flower, beeswax and a whiff of acacia honey. The lean palate is already evolved, showing yellow-apple skin, bitter almond and a hint of citrus zest alongside bracing acidity.
This is an amazingly rich Cabernet, packed with classic Napa blackberry, blueberry and dark chocolate flavors. It's opulent even by California standards, and is a little sweet. With firm, pronounced tannins, it's gritty in texture. Defines Napa ripeness, but at this point it's rude and jammy. Give it a good six years. Could be one for the long haul.
Now at its peak, this impressive wine is showing ripe white fruits touched with almonds, a soft texture and a rich, creamy feel. The Clos du Papillon, so called because the vineyard is shaped like a butterfly (papillon) is a star performer in Savennières.
This wine smells like dried herbs and white pepper, tastes herbaceous and feels rather stiff on the tongue. Being lean in style, it's not a great stand-alone drink but will be good at the dinner table.
From fruit growing around the village of Wettolsheim, this is a powerful, earthy style of wine. It may not have subtlety, but it makes up for this in its fresh impact, with flavors lemon, of grapefruit and some minerality and a tannic structure.
Tart and herbal in sage, this is a densely concentrated wine that wraps its head around black cherry, cranberry, pomegranate and black tea. A note of freshly baked bread pokes through on the nose and within the fruitier, savory flavors.
Smells leathery and savory, then folds in ripe, plummy fruit on the mouthfilling palate. Finishes supple and softly dusty. Ready to drink now.
Intense and very spicy, this mixes dense, liquorous and very dark flavors —soy, balsamic, coffee extract, smoke and more—with leafy, herbal, peppery scents. The fruit is concentrated and also dark, raisins and prunes, and the tannins, though carefully managed, are substantial and again, dark, dense and smoky. An interesting wine, with compelling length.
Mineral tones are woven clean throughout peach, apricot and exotic fruit. This luminous Pinot Bianco offers heft and intensity and although the alcohol seems high, the wine does a good job of keeping the palate clean.
Super-high in acids, almost sour, and tannic too, with dry flavors of bitter cherries. If this is your kind of wine, break out the rich meats, butter and cheese and enjoy.
Firm tannins and its dark plum and blackberry fruits all point to a structured wine that has aging potential. It is ripe, with black cherry and spice notes that are balanced with acidity. Keep for one year.
Complex Asian pear and citrus fruit is nicely detailed with notes of orange rind, fennel and spice. The fruit is perfectly ripe, round and fleshy. The acids are natural and the alcohol has been kept to just under 14%.
Very smoky aromas, the fruit ripe with sweet blackberry flavors. The wood is still very present, not yet completely integrated; there is a touch of green perhaps from the wood. At the same time, the wine is developing while keeping a fresh streak of acidity.
The aromas in this wine are light, with notes of herb, citrus and orange peel. The palate is dry and broad, with tart citrus flavors. Although appealing, it seems a bit generic.
This is a crisp wine, full of acidity. It holds the potential of crisp green and citrus fruits that are developing. A nutty edge contrasts with the tense acidity. Drink from late 2017.
Very rich, ripe and dry, a Merlot with a drop of Cabernet that needs a year or two to resolve. It's fat and fleshy in cherries, violets, red currants and cola, with a dusting of cocoa, pepper and cinnamon. The tannins are ample, but very finely ground. Hold until 2011.
Dried currant opens the nose of this savory wine. There's a raw and slightly rustic element to this lean, informal wine that recalls the beautiful terroir of Abruzzo.
Lulu Bernard is the daughter of winemaker Louis Bernard. Under her name, the firm has produced an open, generous, easygoing wine, more to do with the perfumes and ripe fruits of Syrah than with the structure.
Dry as dust and very tannic, this Cabernet simply isn't ready for prime time yet. It's tightly wound and tough, and resists breaking down. But there are plenty of blackberries tucked deep inside. Hold this elegant wine until after 2015.
With 21% residual sugar, this is an enormously sweet wine, one of the most honeyed of the vintage. A little sugar goes a long way, of course, but this wine also charms with rich, powerful apricot, peach and vanilla custard flavors, perfectly balanced with crisp acidity. With consistently high scores over the years, Tears of Dew has taken a place in the front ranks of California dessert white wines.
While the wood aromas are strong, so is the rich fruitiness. Ripe yellow fruit flavors give a generous, rounded feel. At the end, fresh acidity gives welcome contrast. Drink now, but better from 2015.
Lime and mineral notes are about all that arise from the bouquet. On the palate, this is a sizzler with blazing acidity and narrow flavors of lemon and green apple. Yes, it's very fresh and cleansing; but this is also acidic and lean.
High-toned blueberry, blackberry and cherry fruit is accented with nuances of herbs and chocolate. This is still tannic, young, grapey and tight; the winery is always one of the first to release their red wines. The Pepper Bridge vineyard is in Walla Walla, though the bottle's label says Washington State. This wine clearly needs more time in bottle to reveal its deeper mysteries
Just what you want in a clean, pleasant, everyday wine that won't break the bank. It's citrusy and fruity, with a nice cut of green-grass aromas and flavors.  Drinks dry and clean.
So rich and soft with chocolate, raspberry and vanilla flavors, this wine is better sipped by itself than with food. The alcohol level is enormously high, giving this Cabernet the headiness of a Port.

Has whole wheat aromas. The palate deals juicy fruit and nicely textured, youthful tannins. Medium-sized and built for the long haul; aging John Riddoch for 20 years is common down under.
Bone dry and light, with cranberry, cola and tomato flavors in a silky package. This is a wine that seems to be an expression of its vineyard. It's not a rich wine, nor one to age beyond a year or so. But it possesses an earthy honesty. —S.H.
So sweet in fruit, it's almost like a dessert pastry. Shows blackberry, cherry and cocoa flavors, with pie spices and caramelized oak. Finishes a little sweet, but it's clean and made in a popular style.
For the price you can't go wrong with a wine like this. It's flowery and fruity, and beyond that it doesn't pretend to be more than it is. There's a natural creaminess to the feel and full melon and white fruit flavors. Proof that some Chardonnays do better without oak.
Deep and dark blueberry fruit is laced with dark spices and clove extract on the nose of this two-grape wine by Welshman Damian Gridley. It's soft and juicy on the hedonistic palate, with a spicy acidity that lingers long and a touch of dill for decent complexity.
In this generous interpretation of Nuits Saint-Georges, ripe berry fruits burst through the typical dry tannins. It has plenty of red-fruit flavors, a generous texture and structure. Drink this already attractive wine from 2018.

Like most Tradition wines in Cahors, this fruity and perfumed wine has been aged in stainless steel to keep the fruitiness. Blackberry flavors are cut with acidity and a tight tannic character. It needs to age another few months, so drink from late 2016.
A truly lovely and engaging nose bears scents of cherries, raspberries and exotic spices. It seems Italian in style, but with New World ripeness and power. A fine example of a domestic Super Tuscan-style wine.
With swathes of delicious herbal and green Sauvignon Blanc fruit just delicately underpinned by the wood aging, this is a wine that is rich while remaining so crisp. It is the tangy grapefruit and crisp texture that will allow this wine to age. Drink from 2020.
Fairly serious for a value wine, with touches of spice, mint and dark fruit on the bouquet. The palate features solid red-fruit flavors that may be stretched thin but are good nonetheless. Snappy, upright and just solid enough. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.
Certain wines exude a sense of elevated excellence. This one gets to that level via aromas of spice cake, baked plum and tobacco aromas. A stocky saturated palate is structured and built to age, while this tastes of cool blue fruits, herbs, coffee and chocolate. A smoothly textured finish deals cocoa and mocha notes. Drink through 2040.
Muted on the nose, this offers shy notes of anise and fennel that arises out of the glass over time, buoyed by a generous proportion of golden apple and honey. It veers briny around the full-bodied finish.
Black as a cave and thick as jam, this wine offers a decadence of black licorice and chocolate truffle, aged entirely in new French oak for 30 months. Fruit plays a supporting part to the richness, making for a wine that's a dessert in itself.
Produced in the Douro Superior region in the far east of the Douro Valley, this wine is dense with tarry tannins and black fruits. Wood aging and the concentration of old vines make it impressive. Drink now until 2022.

A rich Pinot Noir that's drinking well now. With a delicate, silky texture, it offers powerful flavors of cherry and raspberry jam, mocha, Indian spices and sweet, toasted oak.
The completeness of 2001, with its miraculous balance, is present in this wine. The acidity, ripe blackcurrants sit comfortably on top of dry tannins, the fleshiness of the fruit taking the edge off the tannins. It seems to bring out the structure, the fruit and the refreshing acidity of great Cabernet.
These ancient vines provide a rich and succulent wine. Ripe black cherries and rich fruit are enhanced by the tannins and concentrated texture. It is a wine that will age, although it is ready to drink. Drink until 2022.

An attractively fresh rosé with no complexity but crisp pleasure from the wild strawberry fruits and light acidity. Enjoy as an aperitif.
Aromas of underbrush, black fruit, toast and espresso lead the nose on the blend of Sangiovese and 15% Malvasia Nera.

The raspy tannins need to soften up but the fruit richness is already drying up.
This is a lively, bright young white wine that brims with acid-inspired tangerine, lime, quince and clove flavors. It has a little touch of oak, but is really fruit-driven. Represents a nice value in a dry, fairly complex sipper.

This wine is a blend Cabernet Sauvignon (61%), Merlot (31%) and Syrah. The aromas open up with vibrant notes of cranberry, cherry, baking spice, licorice, vanilla and barrel spice. The palate is concentrated with cherry and blackberry flavors that show a lot of textural appeal. The tannins bring a touch of grit.

Made in the Edmeades style of high alcohol and exceptional ripeness, this is a powerfully explosive Zin. Fully dry, it's packed with black currant, cassis, plum jam, dark chocolate and spice flavors that are wrapped into hard tannins. Will soften in time. Best now through 2012.

Plush, ripe, soft and smooth, this wine presents a long list of pleasurable attributes. It opens with a dark garnet color and blackberry, cherry, vanilla, mocha, espresso and tobacco aromas. There's a very clean or pristine nature overall and the wine boasts ripe fruit flavors, backed by smoke and sweet spice.

The crispness and acidity are very evident in this bright, fresh, strawberry-flavored wine. Drink soon for its delicious liveliness.
Exceedingly rich and sweet in blackberries, currants and chocolate, this Cab is also high in alcohol, but there's no heat. The glycerine-like sweetness is part of the enjoyable package. 100% new French oak is not out of balance, bringing sweet vanilla and toast to the package. Defines the Paso style of warmth, opulence and soft deliciousness.

The winery's Vintage Select Cabernet was famous in its day as one of California's greatest and most long-lived. It's not entirely clear why they changed the name to Vintage Selection, but this is still a very good wine. Ripe, succulent currant fruit and a soft mouthfeel are the highlights, seconded by complexity, dryness and a gentle application of new French oak. So gently appealing now, it's drinkable, and should develop for 6–10 years.
Grown in the Van der Kamp vineyard, better known for Pinot Noir, which is a bit surprising. But this is a very fine 100% Cab, although it's tannic and needs a little time. Shows lush flavors of blackberry tart, cherry pie, milk chocolate and sweet, smoky oak, with a long, spicy finish. Best in the narrow window of 2010–2012.
Aromas of red berry, violet and baking spice are front and center. Polished and savory, the palate offers cinnamon and crushed herb alongside a backbone of refined tannins. Bright acidity lends nice balance. Drink 2023–2033.
Winemaker: David Nieuwoudt. There's a lot of oaky influence throughout the nose and mouth of this smooth, lush Shiraz, but it works and is balanced with the wine's other characteristics. Aromas of mocha, sweet spice, vanilla bean and toasted oak layer atop the berry preserved, macerated cherry and plum sauce core. Hints of fresh herbs and graphite add lift to the medium-weight, silky palate, alongside ample acidity. It's a sexy little number that's delicious now but should also hold well through 2021.
Made from certified organic grapes, this wine is both savory and tannic, a tad muted on the nose and wanting in texture. Cassis and pipe tobacco stand out most.
Dark, with a complex nose mixing very ripe, raisiny fruit with smoke and a hint of spoilage. The wine seems pushed just over the edge, losing focus and definition. The fruit quickly gives way to leaf and forest floor flavors in an herbal, earthy finish.
Made in the modern style of lots of ripe tropical fruit, green apple and creamy oak flavors, this Chardonnay is uplifted by bright, citrusy acidity. Drink it now.

Blagny is a small hamlet just up the hill from Les Perrières. This is a cooler spot, and the wine shows this with its structure and flavors of fresh green fruits over generous portions of wood. A wine that should age for more than 5 years.
This is just the third Sauvignon Blanc from Stevens (none was made in 2008), sourced from Klipsun vineyard and stainless steel fermented. Richly textural, with a creamy minerality, this has a pleasing intensity, a sort of nervosity (as the French might put it), lined with a sweet grain character. The fruits are tart and racy, a mix of citrus rind and pulp, tangerine and pineapple, finished with natural acidity.
Odfjell's new entry into the under-$10 category is Babor, and the wine has aromas of raspberry jam and a touch of bramble and vinegar. The mouthfeel is sappy and tangy, while the flavors lean toward cola and cherry. Classic value wine in the sense that it delivers up to a point.
This is an intriguing wine that the winery made “naturally,” with indigenous yeasts, no additions and no filtration. It's slightly musky and nutty at the same time, with a slightly creamy note to the pineapple-like fruit. It's medium-bodied, at 12.5% abv, round in the mouth, yet crisp and slightly chalky on the finish.
Ripe black cherry and cedary aromas can't hide the touch of alcohol that seems to emanate from the glass. But the wine is balanced on the palate, not showing any excessive warmth, framing its black cherry and chocolate flavors with bright acidity. The crisp acids on the finish accentuate the tannins, making this an uncommonly structured Grenache. Imported by Wine Brokers Unlimited.
This Sierra Foothills wine is fruity enough, even semi-sweet in flowery peach and vanilla flavors, but there's a rough-hewn edge that tells you it's a rustic wine.
Awkward in the mouth, with hard-edged tannins and cutting acidity that interferes with the berry, cherry, currant and spice flavors. This old-fashioned wine could mellow over the years, without gaining complexity.
This is a Merlot you might want to lay down for a while. On release, it's dry and tannic, with primary fruit cherry and red currant flavors that are only just starting to shake hands with the oak. By 2016, it will be as good as it ever will get.
Made in stainless-steel tanks and a mix of French and American oak barrels, this new, low-priced, low-in-alcohol white is straightforward in its rich layers of butterscotch and tropical vanilla, with a roundness that many will find attractive.
Capture continues to make progress in interpreting their vineyard located in this new appellation, a high elevation overlooking Alexander Valley. Based on Cabernet Sauvignon, this Bordeaux-style blend is young now, with hard tannins that interfere with the fruit. The fruit is intensely concentrated with cherry compote and cassis flavors, while new oak's vanilla and toast are proportionate to the wine's volume. A worthy followup to the 2009, and a wine to cellar for 8–10 years, if not longer.
Pretty aromas of Bartlett pear and a floral note lead the nose on this easy-drinking wine. The simple, refreshing palate offers lemon zest and apple alongside tangy acidity.
Powerful but not real precise, especially as the earthy, tight nose unveils itself. The mouthfeel is tight, narrow and tannic, yet the flavors are big and meaty, and also sort of generic in terms of berry flavors. Medium-length and rough on the finish, with lasting acidic bite.
Although this wine is currently a bit firm and closed, it has the stuffing for great evolution and shows promise for a long future. Dark, ripe raspberry and strawberry fruit characters are laced with touches of Asian spice, reduced balsamic and wild game. The medium-weight mouthfeel boasts chewy tannins that persist long into the finish. Drink 2014–2018.
Full bodied, creamy in texture and long on the finish, the 2009 Le Sol is the complete package. Blackberry fruit is accented by cracked pepper and vanilla, but closer examination reveals hints of black olive and coffee as well. The tannins are exquisitely silky on the finish, where the fruit comes to the fore. Drink now–2020.
Here's a Nero d'Avola (with a small percentage of mystery grapes) that delivers the goods year after year: cinnamon, vanilla bean, pine nut, curry spice and leather round off a deeply concentrated and layered wine that sees 16 months of new French oak. Flavors are reminiscent of Indian spice and turmeric with tight, dusty tannins. Imported by William Grant & Sons, Inc.
Atypical for this normally delicate varietal, hereÕs a big, sturdy wine with aromas of black raspberries, licorice, and plums, and the fruity flavors are big and full-bodied, although those Pinot Noir silky tannins are here. There are some disagreeable raisiny, pruny notes in the finish.
Yeasty, sweet pastry notes are enticing on the nose of this intense, juicy, off-dry Riesling. It has a delicate structure and a creamy texture, and it balances brisk, lemony acids with ripe yellow-peach and grapefruit flavors.
Bright cherry and blue floral aromas come with hints of leather and spice. The vibrant palate delivers succulent wild cherry and white pepper restrained by fresh acidity and bracing tannins. It has mesmerizing depth, finesse and balance. Drink 2015–2028.
Layers of toast, char and dill abound on this oak-driven, full-bodied Chardonnay. There are glimpses of fresh apple and lemon on the palate as well, but they peek through a bit shyly behind a curtain. Further cellaring may help to integrate the oak.
While it obviously has a relatively high dosage (added sweetness), this is still a fresh and balanced wine, with a mineral edge to go with the green apple flavors. The finish is ripe and soft.
Youthful on the nose, with aromatic hints of fine aged cheese and leather blended with earthy berry fruit. The palate is firm and tannic, but not hard. And the flavors of sweet berries, black plum and vanilla are hugely appealing. Coffee, berry essence and a certain chewiness define the finish. An excellent wine with regional expression that will be at its best in a couple of years.
Earthy aromas of leafy underbrush, leather, ripe blackberry, savory herb and baking spice lead the nose on this warm, full-bodied red. The lush, juicy palate offers ripe black plum, fig, black pepper and graphite alongside velvety tannins. A licorice note signals the close.

This solid Sangiovese-based red from the southwestern area of Tuscany is lighter, but more evenly textured than Rocca delle Macìe's Rubizzo. The black-cherry, slate and leather aromas and flavors are on the mark, as are the firm tannins on the moderately long finish.  Best Buy.
This is a really light wine with bright fruit and a crisp texture. It has a breezy feel—all crisp fruit and lively acidity. Drink now.
Lime, slate and floral aromas lead to an off-dry palate, with generous amounts of stone-fruit flavors. Floral notes persist on the finish.
While this is certainly on the higher end of South African Shiraz price points, it's worth the investment. The intense bouquet is loaded with rich dark cherry, raspberry, sweet spice and small wild strawberries. All-spice and pepper dominate the creamy mouth, with opulent flavors of meaty plum, roasted espresso and black cherry guts. Full and powerful in the mouth with a strong vanilla-accented finish. Delicious now but worthy of cellar time as well.
Dramatic and unctuous, displaying Rosemary's usual complexity and intensity. In this fine vintage, the ripe grilled pineapple, peach tart, crème brûlée, buttered toast, honeysuckle and mineral flavors are accompanied by fine, crisp acidity that brightens and lifts the richness. Very rich and elegant. Drink now–2010.
The price is almost ridiculous for the quality. This is a dark, plummy rosé, perhaps best served with beef because of its bold flavors, full-bodied, textured mouthfeel and slightly tannic finish. Next time you're thinking Beaujolais, try this instead.
Soft, peach and pear dominated wine, this has a ripe and rich character, its flavors packed with ripe acidity and a tangy texture. It is full-bodied with good acidity to keep it all fresh.
A dry and austere style is what you're looking at with Heredad. The nose offers simple citrus and soda aromas, while the palate is sheer and defined by apple, light spice and cleansing acidity. Not much depth below the surface but definitely clean and flashy.
A touch of petrol shows the maturity of this wine. It's combined with almonds, pear juice and light acidity. From biodynamically grown fruit, this is rich and ready to drink.
93–95. Barrel sample. This is a chocolate-inflected wine with a full mouth feel, and a very dark character. The palate is concentrated in tannins and a powerful, extracted feel. The aftertaste brings out more black-currant fruitiness.
A rounded wine, offering pear flavors brightened by soft acidity. The wine has an attractive edge of toast to fill out the fruit.
Soft and ripe enough to drink now, after a decent decanting, it shows pure raspberry, blueberry and cherry fruit flavors, subtlely accented with cola and baking spices, and all of it wrapped into thick but smooth tannins. Good as it is, it will gain traction over the next 15 years.
Dry, crisp and very fresh, this wine is a lighter style of Grüner, but delicious. The grapefruit flavors are clean, poised and lightly elegant. Not imported
The amount of alcohol in this Syrah has increased in 2010, which will appeal to some palates. The downside is the loss of texture and subtlety. Smooth and powerfully fruity, this hits with some chewy tannins, but it stops a bit short. More bottle age could certainly be a boon to this wine.
Chardonnay from a hot valley in a hot vintage equals something like this. Orange peel and oak aromas, a pulpy palate and warm flavors of orange and grapefruit.
This is rich, ripe, fat and seemingly oaky. It may be too much of a good thing. Massive in caramelized, butterscotch, pineapple, peach, apricot, lime and cotton candy flavors, it might overpower any food you have it with. Almost better as a cocktail sipper.
Ambruco is a softly layered and rich wine that imparts opulent aromas of chocolate, sweet spice, dark fruit, plum, prune and licorice. There's a touch of bitterness in the mouth but otherwise the mouthfeel is thick and dense enough to smooth out any wrinkles.
This blend of 58% Petite Sirah and 42% Zinfandel provides a good example of a winery going over the top and succeeding. Aromas recall blackberry-laced tea, dried rose petals and Luxardo cherries. Cassis provides the centerpoint of the flavor profile, with a backbone of ample tannins and touch of tar.
Ripe, creamy wood aged wine, this is rich and smoothly textured. It has weight, apple and pear flavors. Full in the mouth, it may be missing out on the freshness in favor of power.
Honey, white peach and vanilla cream show on the nose of this bottling from winemaker Sabrine Rodem, with a kick of hazelnut as well. The palate is all about restrained richness, its buttery lemon curd and cinnamon flavors cut by bright acidity and a lemon-peel tang.
This Prosecco boasts a very attractive combination of fresh, lively and concentrated floral notes opposite complex toasted notes. Medium bodied, which is big for Prosecco, with good acidity and a spicy finish. Imported by Masciarelli Wine Co.
Tropical aromas of lychee and honeydew set up a straightforward palate. Powdery flavors of green melon and lychee are light and flowery on a modest finish.
This is a tribute wine, its proceeds donated to ALS research. Floral, it's also smoky, with a hit of tannin prominent on the palate on first sip. Bittersweet chocolate, game and leather finish things out.
Clean, nutty and smooth, if a touch neutral on the nose. The palate pushes more nuts and distant white fruits, followed by a finish of fleur de sel and cashew butter. Slightly heavy but that's the style; like its sister manzanilla, this wine is very consistent year to year.
Vibrant aromas of honeysuckle, orange peel, peach, jasmine and citrus lead to off-dry stone-fruit flavors. It provides a lot of appeal.
This is an easy, approachable Chardonnay with toast, peppery aromas and a pretty balance of vanilla, toast and spice. It's a soft style of wine that will pair well with cheeses, poultry dishes and salads.
Rich, with strong flavors of red berries, beetroot and an earthy pepper character. This has all the Zweigelt characters in an easy, fresh wine that also has good juicy concentration. Screwcap.

The mouthfeel is full but elegant, with mint and clove nuances poking through to impact the bold currant-laden palate. A smooth, well-oaked, persistent finish is the encore. Can easily be aged for a decade.
The name astrolabe is a reference to the instrument's importance to the Portuguese navigators as they rounded the world in the 15th century. The wine is more earthbound, tied firmly to the Dão grapes and a finely structured character.

Plump black cherry and plum flavors resonate through the core of this juicy, ripe Cabernet Franc. Its fruity forward style is approachable and appealing but there's a good dose of elegance as well. Brisk cranberry notes brighten the midpalate, leading a delicately tannic finish.
Pronounced notes of vanilla, spice and toast extend from nose to finish on this creamy, silk-edged Chardonnay. The palate is marked by soft peach, apple and pear flavors lifted by sunny lemon acidity. It's overtly oaky, but elegantly composed.

Classic Rutherford Cab. Dry, dusty and slightly herbal, with refined, jammy flavors of red and black cherries, currants, mocha and cedar. The alcohol is a little high, giving this 100% Cabernet a warm, full-bodied feel. The tannins suggest mid-term aging. 2013–2018.
Gorgeous example of the successful integration of fruit and mineral tones. Peach and green melon seem accented by lemon zest or lime. Elegant but structured in the mouth. Imported by Winebow.
A touch syrupy and saucy on first blush, with a full, healthy, ripe palate that's typically Chilean due to herb, berry and leather flavors. Sound, smooth and driven on the finish, with overall good vibrations for an organic wine.
A jammy character to this wine jars with the dry tannins. It is extracted, with a firm, bitter character. A Châteaux Solidaires wine.
The nose of this wine is all about oak, with toast and char leading the way. The palate follows suit yet shows a bit more fruit, with grilled red-berry flavors washing over a lithe, crisp palate.

The wine is ripe and bone dry. It has a tight structure, mineral texture and intense acidity. There is a bitter edge in this young wine that will blow away as the ripe white fruit asserts itself. At the end, there is a touch of honey.
At this point subdued, this wine promises future pleasures with a ripe, rounded but precise character. Right now, it's citrus that shows, with ripe lemon zest and some grapefruit. Underneath riches of red apples, yellow peaches and apricots await. Purity and minerality are a bonus. This is a keeper; drink as of 2018.
Flat and basic, with charred secondary aromas. Simple red fruit with rubbery tannins make for an average palate. Easy enough but hard to find anything special or exciting to go on about. Imported by Wine Source Selections.
Reduced, floral and plummy on the nose, this is a simple, blocky, tannic young wine. Medicinal berry flavors finish loud and grapy, with a grabby, tacky feel. Fruit outweighs finesse.
Superripe wine that wears its high alcohol easily. The fruit is so rich, with its plum and blackberry flavors, opulent and generous. There is a dark core of tannins that shows slowly through all the intense fruit, promising good aging. Keep for 4–5 years.
Earthy aromas and meaty flavors make this medium-bodied wine a bit of a wild card. Consumers expecting an average red blend may find this too funky, but it does feel rich and have a lingering finish.
A ripe wine that goes in the direction of tropical fruits, only hinting at a more herbaceous character. It is full of peach and pineapple that are balanced with lime. Ready to drink in 2015, it leaves a warm, rich aftertaste.
Sourced principally from the excellent Artz vineyard on Red Mountain, this blend of 78% Sauvignon Blanc and 22% Sémillon is ripe and lush, almost to the point of tasting sweet. No residual sugar was listed, but in terms of flavor, it's hard to ignore. If you like that richness, there is a creamy, milk-and-honey flavor, along with toasty notes.
Dense but not overpowering aromas of iron, cherry jelly, dried cranberries and black rocks show on this wine, a combo of the Pommard and 2A clones. It's fairly lush at the tip of the sip, with smoked-meat flavors, but then stays reserved down the middle, with pencil lead, cranberry fruit and sanguine notes into the finish.
No punches are pulled on this 100% varietal wine. Aromas of freshly sliced red apple, cranberries and milk chocolate lead to candy-bar-sweet cherry and chocolate flavors. It doesn't entirely come together but provides enjoyment.
This is a fat wine with ripe fruits and a strawberry flavors. The palate is dry, with a soft texture. Drink now.
The aromas are so promising, redolent of toast and pears, butter and nectarines, that expectations are high. And make no mistake—this is very good wine. It's just that a slightly resinous veneer of spicy oak largely dominates the palate and finish.
Smoky aromas of fresh-cut wood blend with berry and cassis form a welcoming, generous bouquet. This feels lively on the palate, albeit tartaric. Oaky plum, cassis and vanilla flavors finish full and agreeable. Drink through 2019.
This wine is already balanced and developing quickly. It has fine acidity and crisp citrus and floral honey flavors. With its light touch, it's likely to be ready to enjoy. Drink now–2021.
Delicate scents of wild berry and fragrant blue flower float out of the glass. The refined, easy-drinking palate doles out succulent black cherry, licorice and a coffee note while polished tannins provide lithe support.
Good balance throughout typifies this Columbia Valley Cabernet. The tart fruit suggests cranberry and raspberry, accompanied by generous acidity. A hint of herb runs through the finish, but the tannins are well-managed and smooth.
The best Paraiso Chard I've ever had, this inaugural wine, a low-production block release, is tight and firm. Acidity, minerals and lees star. But there's also a tremendous core of ripe tropical fruits, roasted hazelnut, marzipan, coconut macaroon and all sorts of interesting things. Cellar it for a while, then drink from 2007–2010.
Deep notes of elderberry and pepper meet with roasted lamb on the somewhat reductive nose of this bottling. The structure is a bit rigid at this early date, giving a lengthy frame to flavors of deep purple fruit, brown baking spices and a touch of vanilla.
Here's a “wow” wine you won't easily forget. Messorio is all Merlot, and happily delivers the softness, richness and overall opulence that we love in this noble grape variety. What elevates this particular expression and vintage is the true elegance and sophistication evident here. This is a huge wine, but it's not exaggerated and the finish is as long and smooth as they come.
Bright and delicious, this starts with aromas of blue flower, red berries, mint and thyme together with a whiff of leather. The juicy palate offers wild cherry and strawberry accented with cinnamon-spice alongside fresh acidity and firm but fine tannins. Drink now through 2016 to capture the fresh, crunchy berry character.
This fruity wine is light in texture. It has gentle tannins, with bitterness and a stalky character that brings out the acidity.
This enormously rich, extracted Pinot Noir will please flavor-forward fans. It's explosive in raspberries, cherries, cola, figs, bacon, orange zest and other umami tastes, wrapped into a silky texture and brightened with crisp acidity. Seems best now and for a year or two.
Here's a soft Pinot Noir that's rich in raspberries, cherries and roasted almonds, with a smoky coating of oak. It's seems a little sugary sweet—like a melted granola bar.
One of the “12 Zins of Lodi 2014,” it was chosen in a judging by the Lodi Winegrape Commission to represent the region's finest. The deep red-black color is saturated to the rim. Deep, evocative aromas lead to ripe cherry, boysenberry, chocolate and nutmeg flavors that echo on the finish. The texture is full and smooth.
This is raisiny and jammy on the nose. That's followed by a scratchy palate with rough tannins. Roasted grapy flavors are just pleasant enough, while a gravelly finish is ruled by residual hard tannins.
A pretty salmon-pink-colored wine, which is soft and dominated by easy flavors of pink grapefruit and crisp acidity. This is fresh, and fine as an apéritif. Imported by Grape Expectations of Georgia.
This is typical Coonawarra Cabernet, with aromas and flavors of eucalyptus, cassis and cedar that meld together into a harmonious, balanced whole. Dusty tannins give it a firmly structured feel; drink 2010–2018.
While rich, this blend of Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon is also quite herbal in character. Maybe it gets its nature from the wild garrigue countryside of Provence, but its tannins are firm and the fruit is laced with licorice. It should age another year.
This is a Chardonnay-like Pinot Gris, rich and creamy and complex. It offers flavors of pineapples, apricots and pears that are ripe and spicy. Crisp acidity accents the fruit, cleansing the mouth and making the wine brisk.
There's nothing shy about this Zinfandel. A kick in the teeth, this exudes the concentrated fruit of Sonoma County's Rockpile area. It has hard tannins, and it's front-loaded with currant, licorice and tobacco flavors. Pair this with intensely-flavored, spicy grilled meats.
Bright cherry cola and root beer notes veer beautifully onto the balsam side, with dried ginger and chopped mint. Some firm tannic astringency needs to soften with time, and there's a drying mineral tone that holds it all together.
A fruity, lightly tannic wine, this has ripe berry-fruit flavors and a soft texture. Smooth and light, it's a fresh style of wine, easy on the red fruits and with a spicy aftertaste. Screwcap.
Fruit and spice come together in this young wine. It is structured with a core of dry tannins along with black currant fruit and a flavor of new wood. Finely made, this should be ready to drink in six months.
A deep straw, this unusual Chardonnay has a strong herbal component, with penetrating seed and grass flavors wrapped around tart, green apple fruit. It's a little oxidized, drinking well, but not for cellaring.
This pure expression of Corvina (one of the main grapes used in Amarone) opens with a pretty ruby color and bright aromas of forest berry, blueberry and white almond. It boasts an easy, fresh mouthfeel that would work with pork or smoked ham.
A balanced specimen, from front to back and top to bottom. The nose deals smooth fruit touched up by chocolate and a whiff of mint, while the mouth is spicy and herbal but also saturated with dark berry notes and touches of the forest. Stout in terms of feel, with cheek-to-cheek depth.
This Bordeaux-Rhône blend is tannic and hard in the mouth. It's like chewing on leather, with a beef jerky toughness to the blackberry and cherry flavors. The idea seems to be ageability, but the future of this wine is far from certain.
Just delicious, with full-bodied raspberry and cherry-vanilla flavors that finish with dusty cinnamon spice. Tastes a bit off dry, but the acidity gives it a firm tang.
An easy, polished PG, with its flavorful burst of citrus, lemonflower, apricot, peach, fig, spice and vanilla flavors. Crisp and balanced, it makes you think of picnics, beach parties and warm summer nights.
Attractive background aromas like nutmeg and licorice are taken down a notch by front-running bramble and pickled notes, while the palate is hard, tannic and spunky as it delivers lively cherry, raspberry and chocolate flavors. A good wine with RDD pedigree, but also sort of grabby and rough, with coffee and pepper on the finish.
This wine is 100% varietal. The aromas are locked up at present, with notes of luxurious French oak treatment and cherry. The flavors are dense and concentrated, but the tannins show a fair amount of grip, providing some distraction. There are good things going on but the oak is intense at present.
The flavor expression is neutral on nose and palate—there is however a seam of fresh, lemony acidity at the core and some of that lovely midpalate texture of Chardonnay. This is fresh and has backbone, drink soon.
Blow your Freaking Mind is what BFM stands for. It's a Bordeaux blend, mostly Merlot, with sharply-defined berry-flavored fruit, bright acidity and a fine focus. The mix of Wisconsin and French oak (60% new) gives it a pleasing, chocolaty finish.
Fresh lemon and lime on the nose amass luscious tones of peach and apricot on the palate of this gossamer-light Riesling. It's penetrating and juicy yet anchored firmly by darts of laser acidity and dusty mineral complexities. Sweet honey tones linger long through the finish.
Softly delicious, this is a beautiful Merlot to drink now. It's a little hot in alcohol on the finish, but feels elegant in the mouth, offering waves of cherries, currants and mocha.
You might take this for a Cab because of the intensely pure cassis entry. Then in the midpalate, the prettiest cherries show up, along with lots of new-oaky flavors and elaborate tannins. All the parts are pretty in this exceptionally smooth, stylish Merlot. A great price for such a wine.
Tropical fruit and honeysuckle aromas lead the nose and carry over to the palate, along with hints of banana and yellow pear. The finish is laced with orange zest.
Fully ripe, almost stewy aromas of raisin, prune and blackberry are soft and friendly. That's more or less the theme with this wine; the palate is cushioned and dense, while a loamy set of jammy berry and chocolate flavors finish with raisiny sweetness and a licorice note.
Dusty apple and a hint of scrambled egg define the nose on this brut nature. As you'd expect given the lack of dosage, this is citric and linear in the mouth, with stony lime and green-apple flavors. The finish is refined, clean and lemony, with green-herb flavors.
This is a crisp, fruity and perfumed rosé from Sciaccarellu. It has red-currant freshness, bright acidity and a delicious refreshing character. Drink now.
Very rich, as you might expect from botrytised Chardonnay. It remains surprisingly young, no sign of 11 years' aging, with the acidity coming through freshly over the maple syrup and baked apple flavors. The finish brings the acidity right up front.
Ripe Concord pear and an intriguing, phenolic mouthfeel combine in this highly drinkable light white. There is enough weight to support food and a pleasing hint of savoriness as well as depth.
Zippy flavors of melon and new-mowed grass, nicely integrated and loaded with the sort of spicy herbs that might have come fresh from the garden. Note the relatively low alcohol, making this a perfect summer sipping wine.
Fruity and oaky, a blend of Syrah, Merlot and Petit Verdot of some charm. Shows soft, jammy flavors of cherries, blackberries, mocha, cola and cedar. Ready now.
91–93. Barrel sample. Showing both a firm tannic structure and jammy black fruits, this is a finely ripe and full wine. It has spice, sweet fruits and a solid tannic core. A wine that is likely to age well.
Generous herb, citrus and tropical-fruit aromas are followed by a full-bodied palate chock full of kiwi and other broad tropical-fruit flavors. It's unabashed in its appeal.
A delightful, light, strawberry wine. It has a bright, bubbly character and acidity that gives extra life to this classic apéritif wine. There is just a hint of softness from the fruit to finish.
This is one of the most fruit-forward Amarones I have tasted from this vintage. The concentration and extraction is very good and the nose is richly redolent of plump black cherry, plum, blackberry and blueberry supported by shadings of chocolate, tar and caramel. Creamy succulence and a long, drying finish characterize the mouthfeel. Imported by Wine Wave.
Tropical aromas suggest bath soap. A tight, lemony palate has an oily feel, while flavors of melon, lychee and lime are exotic, finishing with an oily essence of white flowers.
Stone, mineral and metal highlights combine around tight cranberry and raspberry fruit. Concentrated and compact, this distinctive bottling is bone-dry. Drink 2020–2030.
A challenging wine. Seems too forward and brash to be really elegant, with blackberry, currant and cherry flavors that taste more like pie filling than dry table wine. New oak slathers on layers of vanilla and char. But it could knit together and turn more complex with age. Try after 2008, but it's risky.
Syrupy smelling on first take, with bacon, rubber and herb aromas. The palate has a healthy, full feel and a mixed bag of not fully connected flavors including herbs, spice, dried fennel and sweet berry fruits. A somewhat odd tasting blend of 55% Cabernet Sauvignon and 45% Merlot.
This is quite an interesting Pinot Noir. With a scent of mushrooms, cola and cherry pie and good acidity, it's Burgundian, with a pale color and a light, silky body. The alcohol is relatively high, but the wine wears it well. Although it's drinking well now, the wine should get a little better over the next 4–6 years.
Lightly pink in color, this sweet sparkling wine is full of ripe strawberry fruit. And with its low alcohol, it's the perfect pairing for strawberries and cream. Acidity keeps it in balance.
The color is very light, and so are the flavors. Although it lacks intensity, this faintly lemony wine is crisp, clean and moderately refreshing.
Half Cabernet Sauvignon with the balance Merlot along with just a smidgeon (6%) of Syrah, this wine provides aromas of smoke, plum, herbs and black currant. The flavors are broad and generous, with an appealing texture and a finish that lingers.
This is Erath's big production white wine. It's well-balanced, with moderately ripe apple and pear flavors, some noticeable tannins, and firm acids. A solid, middle-of-the-road effort.
A unique blend of equal parts Petite Sirah and Merlot, with a smaller percentage of Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a sizably robust and dry, full-bodied wine. Puckering tannins should settle down in time, allowing the blackberry and black currant that's in there to shine through.
A soft, lush mouthful of baked apples, layered with dark toast and dried spices. Cinnamon and clove notes add to the allusion. Soft and buttery.
Extraordinary for how drinkable it is right now, and for how it will evolve. Shows the crisp acidity and minerality of this cool-climate vineyard, with rich flavors of raspberries, cherry liqueur, cola, exotic spices, vanilla, buttered cinnamon toast and smoky sandalwood. Yet the tannic integrity should help it change in fascinating ways over the next six years. Decant for several hours.
Agiorgitiko, famed in Nemea and popular for its soft, fragrant red berry character, is represented well in this balanced, flavorful wine. A nose of wooded spice, pepper and Mediterranean herbs is followed by waves of soft tannis, red fruit, spice and a touch of smoke. Pair with steak or a meat stew.
A firmly tannic wine packed with both toast and blackberry fruits. It needs to soften to bring out the ripe fruitiness and jammy texture. Drink from 2015.
A fine wine from a producer that dependably produces one of California's best Roussannes. Texturally, it has the weight of Chardonnay, with some French oak influence and the creaminess of lees aging. The acidity is pronounced. Flavorwise, this 100% varietal wine is complex in citrus fruits, peaches and flinty minerality. It has all the hallmarks of a wine that will age gracefully. Drink now–2020.
Extremely intriguing on the nose, this shows aromas of Meyer lemon, green banana and tangerines. Generous yellow fruits like melon and Gala apples show on the palate, which is soft with lemon-bar elements at first but then tightens around green apple skins and a peppery, herbal character.
Showing just the right amount of age, this is a rich Port, with flavors of dried fruit and damson. Its tannins and firm character fit smoothly into the round texture. Ready to drink.
Dense aromas of cassis, blackberry, roasted hazelnut, Nutella and powerful black cherry liqueur. Of particular interest are the background notes of graphite and sweet spicecake. The wine has thick tannins and ripe flavors in the mouth.
The rustic aromas are off-putting in this wine. It has a proper density but seems to have a musty character. This could blow off over time, because the fruit is here.
Plump and medium-weight, with hints of mineral oil and beef broth on the nose, followed by green apple, citrus and some riper stone fruit flavors. The gren apple notes linger on the finish.
Dry and gritty, with rugged tannins and lots of acidity. Unfortunately, the fruit just isn't powerful enough to stand up to it, making this Merlot tough to like.
Leave it to director Coppola to manage an ensemble cast of Zinfandel, Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon, Petite Sirah and Sangiovese and come out with a smashing success. Forward fruit flavors mesh with earthier notes of herbs and tobacco wrapped in a silky texture; the finish is complex and long. Serve it with chops or even a simple pasta with cheese.
This is a fairly sweet interpretation of Sauvignon Blanc, offering flavors of pineapple and pear juice, apricot jam and vanilla. With no oak, it's balanced with crisp acidity, the result of the malolactic fermentation wisely being prevented.
For this sparkler, fermentation occurs inside of the bottle instead of large pressurized tanks like the majority of Prosecco. This is simple and fresh, with a bright, almost sour, citrus-driven finish.
Crisp and grassy on the nose, then lemony in the mouth, with narrow citrus and white peach flavors along with a hint of the veggies. Tangy, lean, slick and acidic in terms of feel, with a tight, lemony finish.
The nose on this Pinot is delicate, perfumed faintly with crisp black cherry, rose petal and spice. The palate is markedly riper, streaked by fleshy black plums and cranberry acidity. It's straightforward in its fruitiness yet balanced smartly, finishing on a fine, yet penetrating, tannic note.
A gorgeously perfumed, dry and lean white, this is light, crisp and bright, with just the right level of viscosity to pair with cheese, charcuterie or spicy chicken. Like those foods, it has a jolt of spice between its layers of lychee and clove flavors.
High alcohol gives this wine a glyceriney sweetness as well as heat, a prickly mouthfeel boosted by plenty of black pepper. Yet it's softly delicious, in the Peachy Canyon way, with an enormous array of blackberries, chocolate and bacon. Drink now.
Hard spice, blackberry and leather form a firm opening salvo, then oak, mocha and chocolate notes take over on the bouquet. The palate is firm and healthy, with minerally berry, spice, leather and chocolaty flavors. Long, alert, pure and driving on the finish. Drink now through 2016.
Lighter in color, this wine packs fruit punch, cola and ripe cranberry into the nose. Flavors mix juicy strawberries with Earl Grey tea, marjoram and orange rind elements.
Trollinger, also known as Schiava or Vernatsch outside of Germany, is a rarity in the U.S. market, but this delightfully crisp, raspberrry-scented bottling is worth seeking out. It releases sweet raspberry and cherry perfume, but also darker notes of smoke, granite and cedar. Cranberry and strawberry flavors are tingling and tart, framed by tight tannins and a deep granite finish. Drinks well now but should improve further from 2021.
Made with 90% Sangiovese and 10% Canaiolo, this opens with pretty aromas of crushed berry, violet and a whiff of menthol. The juicy palate offers black cherry, white pepper and licorice alongside firm but fine-grained tannins.
There's nothing to dislike about the 30th anniversary release of this iconic Australian wine—only the price is hard to swallow. Cedar, earth and mint frame the nose, while the dark-fruit and rich cola flavors ease across the palate in a wave of creamy tannins. It even firms up a little on the finish; could age until 2020.
From the ripe 2015 vintage, this is a smooth opulent wine. With its citrus and pear fruits, rich acidity and tangy aftertaste, this concentrated wine is balanced and ready to drink.
A bit rough in texture and light in body, but offers a nice, silky texture and some ripe flavors of cherries, cola and spices.
Dusty mineral tones accent bright peach and apricot flavors on this slightly off-dry Riesling. Tart lemon-lime acidity lends brightness to the palate, extending a finish flecked with dried, savory herbs.
Cola, beef jerky, roasted meats and dried purple berries hit initially the nose, follow by aromatic woods and black pepper. The flavors are distinctly interesting, with sandalwood, stewed plums, peppered chocolate, soy-braised beef and a tiny bit of reductive tar.
Made by the Château Giscours winemaking team, this wine benefits from their expertise. Skill shows in the velvet textures, the ripe berry fruits and the hidden strength of the tannins and wood flavors. It's going to be a serious, elegant wine. Drink from 2018.
This is a fine blend of Malvasia and Bical giving fresh acidity that's rounded and filled out with spice, perfume and a creamy texture. It's already an attractive wine—bright and fruity. Drink now.
This blend of Cabernet (54%) and Merlot (36%) also includes a bit of Shiraz (10%). The Cab and Merlot show some herbal tendencies and drying tannins, imparting plenty of firmness to this full-bodied wine. Black cherry fruit dominates at this stage, but expect to see some tobacco and cedar emerge over time. Drink 2012–2020.
The aromas suggest notes of herb, vanilla, wood spice, plum and dark fruit. The palate is restrained in style, full of dark-fruit and barrel flavors and lightly grainy tannins.
This wine starts off with vanilla, cinnamon and dark cherry notes on the nose, with the oak-derived elements marrying nicely with the Grenache fruit. It's full bodied, liquorous and lush, with a long, velvety finish. Probably best over the next 4–5 years.
A bit warm and ripe at 15.5%, but the nose of prune, raisin and blackberry is rich and only gets better with airing. The palate features tobacco and savory black fruit, and the finish runs for miles with chocolate and licorice. Despite its weight, there appears to be ample acidity to protect the wine's integrity. A blend of 75% Malbec and 25% Cabernet Sauvignon.
This is a thick, almost syrupy Riesling, packed with fruit flavors of peaches and apricots. It's tilting toward off dry, with residual sugar at 15 g/L, drinking well though somewhat one-dimensional.
Perfumed with white flowers, this wine is crisp, bright and light in character. Lovely, pure acidity is highlighted in an attractive combination.
This superripe Cab has rich, sweet flavors of blackberries and cherries that taste sugary, as if they'd been prepared for pie filling. It's also soft in tannins. Drink this easy wine now.
Very ripe and lush, this Pinot shows deep flavors of cherries, raspberries, licorice, vanilla fudge, mint, cinnamon, nutmeg and sandalwood. It's at its silky, exotic best now and for a few more years.
An waft of leather saddle opens this release from an historic Diamond Mountain site celebrating 40 years of wines with this vintage. Soft and refined, it's a complex expression of cassis, black currant and mountain tannins, well integrated and age-worthy. The finish is lengthy in a touch of coffee. Drink now through 2022.

Opening with subtle aromas of white flower, this lively straightforward sparkler doles out yellow apple and citrus zest. Crisp acidity gives it a refreshing finish.
Starts out sort of jumbled, with heavy aromas, deep fruit scents and a shot of leather or animal hide. The palate is healthy, however, with proper acidity pushing earthy plum and berry flavors. Shows good structure and ample size and mouthfeel. The blend is 75% Garnacha and 25% Graciano.
Balance is what typifies all the latest Walla Walla Vintners's reds. Here, the grape's natural herbal highlights are linked to well modulated acids and tart rhubarb and berry fruit. Young and full of life and lift, this excellent Sangiovese should continue to improve for up to a decade.
Spicy tomato, rosemary and earth aromas comprise the nose on this basic, scratchy blend of Garnacha and Carignan. Red-fruit flavors combine with mild saltiness in front of a finish with tobacco notes.
A fine, crisp and clean Sauvignon Blanc at a good price. It's basically dry, with a honeyed edge to the tropical fruit, lime and peach flavors, and shows a good bite of acidity.
Lots of hard tannins and mouthwatering acidity in this Cabernet. It's bone dry, and densely packed with blackberries and black currants, with the tangy minerality of spring water and plenty of oak influence. Too astringent to drink now. Give it 5–6 years, and it should develop even longer than that.
This grand rosé is rich and rounded. Its red fruit flavors are layered with toast and spice notes, with depth that gives the wine another dimension of complexity. It could age in the bottle for at least 3–4 years.
A blend of 85% Sangiovese, 10% Ciliegiolo and 5% Malvasia, this serves up earthy aromas of wet soil, blue flower and overripe black plum. The overripeness continues on the palate with mature black cherry and raisin as well as bitter walnut, coffee and espresso notes. It concludes on a drying note of astringent wood tannins.
This is soft and gentle, with easy berry, herb, cola and sandalwood flavors. Drink now, as this is about as good as it will ever be.

Fruity and off-dry to sweet, this blend of four varieties has flavors of canned pears, peaches and apricots.
Aromatic and highly textural. The wine brings out a lot of citrus rind, tart stone fruits, and leesy texture. There's plenty of acid and hints of an underlying minerality with no hot alcohol burn. Just a little hint of stem in the tannins.
Made with sweetly fragrant Malvasia grapes from the tiny island of Salina off the northern coast of Sicily, this Passito dessert wine opens with all the intensity you'd expect of sunny southern Italy. The wine sports a luminous amber color and aromas of candied fruit or orange rind, dried mint, touches of root beer and even a hint of white licorice.
On some of the highest vineyards in Cahors, this estate has a history reaching back to the Middle Ages. This latest vintage from this major estate has a firm structure and cool texture. Allied to acidity and dark tannins, the rich black fruits are going to need time to mature. Drink from 2020.
Nicely dry and balanced, this Cabernet, from a warm inland appellation in Monterey County, shows elegantly tailored blackberry and coffee flavors supported by firm tannins and a dusting of oak. Drink now.

There's a generous, sunny quality to this Italian Pinot Grigio that comes across with ripe aromas of apricot, melon and Golden Delicious apple. There's a fullness to the mouthfeel as well with soft, slightly sweet fruit flavors at the end.
Harmony and balance are apparent in this elegant, sophisticated sparkling wine from 100% Chardonnay. The wine's aromas include apricot, stone fruit, yellow rose and toasted nut. The perlage is tight and persistent making for a smooth and creamy impression in the mouth.
This 100% Mavroudi, a regional red wine of Thrace, has an expressive, red-fruit nose with warm hints of vanilla and smoky spice. Grown in northeastern Greece on an ancient site overlooking the Aegean Sea, this is smooth and velvety with rich, spicy flavors and a lingering finish. Its texture and complexity lends it to pairings with more opulent dishes like rack of lamb and beef stew, but alternately, consider its Mediterranean roots and sip alongside a plate of spicy black olives or a Greek salad.
Fresh apples and cream aromas with a tight citrus and mineral edge. The fruit is fresh but, with the attractive ripeness of white currants. Very full in the mouth, very much a wine, suggesting an ability to go with food.
Tastes excessively sharp throughout, with a cut of acidity that interferes with the palate's pleasure in the blackberries, cherries, currants and oak.
The Hengsberg vineyard, close to the Klosterneuburg monastery, produces this luscious Grüner, very concentrated and rich. Apples and pear flavors dominate, although underneath there is spice to add complexity. Worth aging for 1–2 years. Glass stopper.
A crowd-pleasing quaffer of a wine, this is tart, with a fresh-squeezed lemon palate that also offers anise, caramel apple and pear. Crisp and dry, it indeed sees no oak—it's pure, with a lasting finish.
Sartori is one of Valpolicella's most important wineries thanks to its focused dedication to local winemaking traditions. This is not as thick or sweet as others. In fact, it shows an elegant, understated quality, with bright cherry and spice overtones.
Quite a beautiful, lush Syrah, and one that goes a long way to restoring faith in this long under-performing appellation. Dry and soft, the wine offers rich flavors of cassis, melted dark chocolate, leather, vanilla and anisette, with a pleasantly spicy edge of black pepper. Drink now.
From old vines in Puglia, this hearty wine shows deep concentration and bold aromas of jammy fruit and blackberry preserve. There are both sweet and sour traces on the finish, and the wine is almost too much of a good thing.
Tasted alongside the winemaker's 2006 from the same fruit, this shows both vintage variation and consistent terroir—the marks of a real professional. The complexity and vitality of the wine remain comparable to the riper 2006. Tart fruits, leaf, herb and streaks of earth make for a lively, interesting palate-pleaser.
Black currant and white plums give this wine its fresh edge and its richness. It has an opulent feel to it, with concentrated spice inside the round texture. The end brings out the relief of crisp acidity.
Really not a very likeable Syrah despite some tasty cherry fruit flavors. The problem is enormously high alcohol, 15.9%, that makes the wine hot, and a near absence of acidity, which makes it cloying. The imbalance makes the tannins astringent.
Fresh and really juicy, this blend of Tinta Roriz and Castelão has black currant flavors that are underlined by good wood aging. The acidity is a balanced component of this easy, ready-to-drink wine. Great fruitiness shows at the end.
Aromas of pear and anise pace the nose of this medium-bodied wine. It's a simple, fruit-cocktail-like sipper, with a quick, easy finish and a reasonable price tag. Drink now.
Nice nose of toast, milk chocolate, confected strawberries and powdered sugar. Light fruits (pomegranate, strawberry) dusted with cocoa and hinting at some of the tobacco notes of Italian Sangiovese.
Winemaker bells and whistles, such as smoky oak and creamy lees, star in this earthy wine, which has been re-released after two years. It doesn't seem at all old. There's enough peach and apple flavor to make it balanced.
The winery's penchant for delicate, lightly balanced wines is again evident here. This has some pleasant herb flavors, gentle nuances of grass and citrus. Cleanly made and finished with a touch of spice. —P.G.
Ripe and oaky, this will appeal to those who love their Chards voluptuous. It's strong in buttered toast, caramelized wood, sweet-and-sour pineapple candy and lemondrop flavors.
Nicely dry, clean and crisp, with zesty acidity framing lemon, lime and peach flavors. Could be a bit more concentrated, but it's a friendly, versatile white wine.
Extraordinary intensity and complexity make this a true standout. The Ovello cru excels in excellent vintages like 2004. This is a polished and pristine wine with a noticeable mineral layer that adds a delicate touch. Tannins and acidity are abundant and the wine culminates with a blast of cooling menthol. Drink after 2018.
An almost honeyed nose tells of the 2015 ripeness, but instead leads to a concentrated palate that intriguingly combines peppery spice, savory herbs and rich mellow yeast.

This is a dense, rich wine that balances intense citrus fruit with a tight mineral texture. It is refreshing, crisp while also concentrated from the old vines. The wine is young and fruity and will be better from 2015.
From Southern Oregon, this new vintage of the winery's Pinot Blanc has been given the all-star treatment—100% barrel fermented sur lie. It's hot, big, sharp and bold, but perhaps stretched a bit too far for the delicate, elegant flavors of the Pinot Blanc grape. The fruit carries no weight and the barrels therefore take over, with bitter phenolics and too much oak.
This Bordeaux blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc is sourced from the estate's Pheasant Run vineyard. Aromas offer a mature mix of baking spices, dusty cocoa and chocolate-covered cherries. The flavors thin out from there, seeming to drop into a chocolate/tannin echo chamber. Not unpleasant, but lacking the depth and texture that have been there in the past.
Packaged in an easy screwcap bottle, this is a simple expression of Sangiovese that would pair with pasta or pizza. Cheerful and bright, it delivers cherry, raspberry and almond aromas.
Candied lemon peel, Asian pear and marzipan hints show on the slightly oxidative nose of this bottling from Jim Clendenen. Ripe apple and pear flavors mark the palate, along with a warm toast component, but a Meyer lemon tang and bitter orange accents cut the richness.
The winery held this Cab back longer than most. Tasted in late 2007, it was quite soft and immediately drinkable. The flavors are rich and ripe, suggesting red and cherries, cassis, licorice, cola and milk chocolate. The wine finishes a little too sweet.
Elusive raspberry tries to find its way to the fore of this big-bodied Pinot, its time in oak apparent yet integrated. Savory herb notes provide a complexity and balance against the dark cherry fruit, rounding out a wine that has girth but also finesse.
The nose here is sweet and hot with aromas that recall ripe blueberry and strawberry backed by pretty spice renderings. The mouthfeel is also sweet, oddly so, and seems chewy and juicy on the palate, but not very long in terms of flavor.
Grown in the upland vineyard of Pyrgos, this Assyrtiko offers citrus and spice aromas and a full-bodied flavor profile. Citrus, vanilla and minerals dominate the palate. Air with more robust vegetable or fish dishes.

Apricot and peach fruits dominate this creamy, soft wine. It's smooth, lightly toasty and ready to drink.
Sourced from two high-profile vineyards, Silver Eagle and Lancel Creek, both farmed by Ulises Valdez, this wine offers an intensity of earthiness on the nose. It otherwise is softly layered in waves of forest floor and dark cherry, with even darker undertones of blackberry and chocolate that rise on the finish.
A widely available offering from Concannon, this Cab is rich in jammy cherry and vanilla, with a backbone of oak, a nice choice for midweek dinners of rib roast and steak.
Pear and green apple flavors dominate on the palate, with similar aromas. Clean, with a wide, chalk and mineral feel.
Olive, green curry, caper and a touch of citrus open the offbeat nose of this unique Ripasso red blend. It shows layers of smoke, mesquite and cola on the close.
This is a seductive wine, concentrated and full bodied and entirely big. Black cherry, chocolate and blackberry jam ride the palate with authority, as soft tannins wrap around the bold flavor.
Aromas of mature berry, espresso, exotic spice and a whiff of menthol emerge on this full-bodied red. The palate shows dried black cherry, coconut, licorice and roasted coffee bean alongside fine-grained tannins. This isn't a classic Nebbiolo but it's polished, balanced and will appeal to those who enjoy oak-driven sensations.
There is plenty of juicy acidity in this wine even though the fruit has a strangely steely character. The tannins give it a firm character that needs to soften.
The 1996 vintage really brings out the minerality in a wine. This grand cru is still austere, very crisp, with some smokiness, apple-skin flavors and intense freshness. Give it another 5–6 years.
Taut, tense, structured and tight-knit, this wine is almost steely in its direct line of taste. The fruit has some richness and flavors of pears and some spice, but this wine relies on its impressive structure.
A concentrated and intense wine, with forward notes of mulled cherry and berry fruit. Despite the listed alcohol, it comes off as a bit liquorous, ending dry and tannic with a skin-driven, astringent finish.
This is a fresh and uncomplicated Nero d'Avola and Cabernet Sauvignon blend that steps forward with aromas of strawberry, blackberry, tar, resin and some dried herbs. Fundamentally it's a very fruit-forward red that is well constructed and tight.
Ripe, dense and smooth from wood aging, this is a modern view of Margaux. At the same time, it shows a beautiful black-currant flavor from the Cabernet Sauvignon, and the Petit Verdot adds great color.
This unusual, brass colored-white opens with aromas that recall candied orange, flint and pressed yellow flowers. Fermented on the skins in cement and aged in acacia casks, this wine shows tertiary flavors on the palate, including smoky mineral, dried herb, dried apricot and ginger drop as well as a hint of nectarine zest. Bright acidity keeps it fresh. Drink through 2018.
Dating back at least to the 17th century, Duplessis was one a hunting lodge. Today, owned by the Lurton family, it has produced a dark and dense wine that has a dry structure at the moment, with a strong extraction character. However, the potential black fruits promise future richness. Drink from 2018.
Named for brothers Richard and Don Lorenzi's mom, whose favorite color was pink, this Merlot-based rosé tastes like a grapefruit sprinkled with sugar, light and perfectly drinkable.
This blend of 55% Grenache, 40% Syrah and 5% Mourvèdre shows considerable weight and richness for the price. Subtle garrigue shadings lead into dark flavors of black cherry, blackberry, cola and licorice, ending with hints of mocha and espresso. Drink it now–2017.
A 100% Cabernet aged in 100% new French oak, grown in the warmer Conn Valley region east of the Silverado Trail. The wood contributes layers of toast and caramel, while the underlying wine is massive, with tiers of blackberries, black cherries, black currants, red currants, cedar and spices. Very dramatic and beautiful, but needs time. 2012–2020, at least.
89-91. Barrel sample. An apple-fresh wine, with its richness coming through slowly. It has weight as well as a touch of marmalade spice and lemon acidity. With its light character, it's delicious.
Expensive, yes, but very fine, especially if you're looking for a Chardonnay that's drier, more elegant and more streamlined than the opulent, buttery modern style. Sleek and crisp in acidity, this features citrus, tropical fruit and mineral flavors, with a balanced addition of smoky oak.
Pale in color, this ripe wine has plenty of flavor. With strawberry fruits cut with intense acidity, it has a fine texture, lightly mineral and with plenty of tangy freshness. Red fruits show strongly at the end. Drink now.
Everything tastes interventionist on this Chardonnay. The fruit is extracted in pineapple jam, the oak is strong, the wine went through malolactic fermentation, which gives it buttered toast flavors, and the acidity feels unnatural given the ripeness. Will satisfy fans of the New World style, but the wine, tasty as it is, lacks authenticity and balance.
Made by Antonino Foderà in Marsala, Vincè (100% Merlot) offers plush sweetness and good intensity of aromas. You'll get honey-roasted nuts, roasted chestnuts, chamomile tea, sweet spice and red currants.
The scent of oak is all over this wine, though it is from neutral, not new, American barrels. Still it seems to over-ride the thin fruit, which hints at cherry candy and little else. The barrels also kick in a bit of spice, but there just isn't much happening here. It's simple, clean, and overpriced!
More immediately accessible and affordable than the producer's great estate bottling, this wine invites the nose with petrol, smashed white flower, wet chalk, lemon curd and pink-grapefruit aromas. The acidity is finely pointed on the refreshing and bitter sip, with lime skin, mandarin-orange pith, quinine and pink grapefruit flavors.
Rich and thick, this is an opulent offering of dark cherry and Asian spice, the spice popping on the palate throughout the long finish. Full bodied, it nonetheless features crisp, balanced acidity and a taste of rosemary and lavender, the perfect companion to a butterflied lamb seasoned the same.
This wine is tight and well-structured, emphasizing a good, gripping texture and firm tannins while tasty berry flavors lurk beneath. It's not something to sip at a party, but a gutsy dinner wine to pour with osso buco or mushroom risotto.
Smoke wafts amidst savory notes of apple on this dry, slightly bitter Riesling. Crisp lemony acidity lends refreshment on the palate.
Ripe, dense blackberry aromas are lightly herbal, soft and inviting. This is full and a touch heavy in feel, with herbal cassis, blackberry, toast and spice flavors that end with oak grain, additional herbal notes and spice accents. If you want to explore the world of Carmenère, this is a good place to start.
You'll find aromas of stewed prune, resin and nail polish remover on this ripe, robust red. The dense, brooding and extremely astringent palate offers raisin, game, anise and a dried herb. Abrasive tannins leave a rough, dried out finish.
A 50-50 blend of Pinot Grigio and Sauvignon Blanc that's crisp and ripe, and offers a touch of spice. A lovely, fresh, green wine.
This is a dry wine, packed with tannins at this stage. With concentrated fruits and spice in the background, it will become a rich structured wine. This Merlot/Cabernet Sauvignon wine was vinified for 12 months in French oak and six months in underground cement vats—aiming for drinkability for at least 10 years. But go ahead and drink the wine starting from 2019.
Give this Sangiovese Riserva a few minutes in the glass to open. Once it does, this dense and richly concentrated expression offers raw notes of black cherry and spice with moist pipe tobacco at the back.
Crisp green apple is the star in this well-made, balanced and elegant wine, that's tangy yet smooth, with a voluptuous tease of anise. Approachably structured, the complexity of the texture and lurking layers of further flavor suggest letting this wine open slowly to unveil its true self, and allowing it to linger on the palate.

Toasty, oak-based spice and baked-apple aromas are sweet and woody, while the rest of the wine is resiny, with flavors of cinnamon, spiced applesauce and banana. Finishes with little fruit and a lot of faux oak flavor. Sticky as well.
The shade of this Kathy Joseph creation is that of rosé-colored sunglasses. Such comfort is furthered with a cherry cola and maraschino cherry nose. A slight effervescent zing on the palate accompanies pomegranate flavors followed by an impressively long finish. Great with a fresh garden salad, but able to handle more substantial fare too, such as  breaded chicken cutlets or a cheeseburger.
A delicious example of Costières de Nîmes, this blend of 80% Syrah and 20% Grenache combines bright raspberry fruit with hints of garrigue for a taste experience that's notable for its complexity. The tannins are supple, while the long finish features hints of chocolate. The review is of the “white label” wine, but the importer claims the wine is identical to that under the Cuvée Elisabeth label.
With a good structure, this is a solid wine from a small vineyard. It is dense with tannins as well as dark berry fruits and fresh acidity at the end. The wine will age well over the next few years, so drink from 2017.
This is a wine that teeters on the edge between superripeness and overripeness. At one moment its fruit comes across as slightly herbal and raspberry-like, while the next it can seem slightly raisined, with a hint of nail polish.

A tart take on Pinot Blanc, with sour peach and pear fruit flavors, finishing slightly bitter with pear skin and a hint of spice.

A firmly structured wine with sufficient fruit to sustain the structure. It is solid and chunky, with hints of mint to go with the black currant flavors. It's serious while also reflecting the fragrant fruits of 2010.
Iris, dark-skinned berry, aromatic herb and new leather aromas take shape in the glass. Vibrant and focused, the bright palate doles out crushed raspberry, Marasca cherry, clove and white pepper framed in tightly knit but polished tannins. It's well balanced, with fresh acidity. Drink 2020–2028.
They must have let the grapes get as ripe as possible, and then macerated the crushed fruit for a long time, as this wine explodes with berry flavors. There's also a good amount of smoky and spicy oak accents. It's a balanced, harmonious Cabernet.
Light in color, with a rosy tint. Aromas of burnt grass, pepper and red fruit are distant and unconvincing, while the palate is generic and rudderless. Not a terrible wine, but lacking in substance.
Good and smooth, with complex Napa tannins and flavors of black currants and cedar along with a firm earthy minerality that must come from the soil. A bit tannic and distant, though. Needs some time. Better after 2011, but not a longterm ager.
Reduced oak makes for an intense beginning. Then spicy acidity and plenty of earthy loam provide varietal character in this medium-bodied, textured wine.

The 2006 flagship Cabernet from Quilceda Creek is a massive wine that has just begun to emerge from its slumber. When first released the wine seemed to have entered a dumb phase, but six months later it responds to decanting and shows its muscle. Fruit flavors of black, brandied cherries, cassis and bourbon-soaked plums are wrapped in generous, layered oak. The wine is dusty, smoky, laced with streaks of licorice and brightened with sharp acids. It continues to expand further in the glass, adding flesh and spice to its frame, with a cedar/cigar box finish.
This is a light wine from the stable of offerings from the Courselle sisters. It has a pale character, just hinting at citrus flavors and lively acidity. It is an apéritif style, light, bright and ready to drink.
Structured and dense, the wine is dominated by its tannins. With a dry core and only the hints of real fruitiness, it is likely to take a while to develop. Final acidity provides hints of a fruitier future. Drink from 2018.
A lovely, complex and flavorful Cab, but also tannic, giving it a lockdown feeling. There's a rich core of blackberries, black currants, spices and herbs, while new oak gives it a savory smokiness. Better after 2010, and should glide through 2014.
Red fruit aromas, soft tannins and a warm feeling permeate this full, fruity wine. It has an open, generous texture, packed with cherry and red berry flavors and layered with acidity. The wine ends fresh and fruity with a touch of tannin.
This is a leaner, lighter expression of Pinot Nero that is slightly weighed down by bulky tones of charred wood that come on the heels of the variety's natural small berry fruit, herbs, white mushroom and peppermint nuances.
Tight and focused, this has a fine core of black cherry and cassis. Layers of coffee and dark chocolate are wrapped around the fruit, and the wine is compact and textural. Excellent now, but probably better in a few years.
94—96 Barrel sample. This is the rich wine of the vintage. With its intensen fruit, piles of spice, but excellent balance, this promises flavors of baked apples and intense dried fruits. The botrytis layer is discreet, a hint rather than overpowering.

A tribute to the family's Austrian heritage, this oddity—it's made from Zweigelt—features perfumed strawberry fruit, crisp acidity and soft tannins. Drink now. Imported by Robert Whale Selections Inc.
Mildly minty and raisiny on the nose, with a jammy, heavy personality. Which makes it surprising that it's so tart and cherry-driven in the mouth. Yet on the finish milk chocolate and coffee come into play. Too scattered and all over the map. Doesn't have a defined personality.
Rather soft and edgy in tannins, but there's reward in the fresh, lively berry, cherry and herb flavors. Finishes a bit too sweet.
Aromatic of honeysuckle, fresh orange peel and rye, this dry Tokaj has all the waxy, honeyed characteristics of its sweet counterparts. This is brisk, with intense, lemony acidity and rippling minerality.

Legend has it that those who listen closely to the well of Château Côte Montpezat can hear the pilgrims on the way to Compostella who drank here. Drinking the wine today offers light spice and wood aromas that give it an extra dimension. Initially, they seem to dominate the fruit, although this passes over as the herbal and green-fruit character of the wine shows through. It does mean that the wine should age a little in bottle, so wait until early 2017.

Bill Foley named this wine after his wife, who works with disadvantaged children, so you can expect it to be a winner. The nose is quite distinctive, a whirlwind of smoke, seared pear, citrus blossom, squeezed Meyer lemon and rain on slate. It's a refreshing breeze to drink, with toasted nuts, cooked apples, a hint of butter and a chalky grip.
There's so much nuance to this multifaceted Chardonnay. Sunny tangerine and apple flavors are accented by hints of smoke, salted butter and a beautiful crushed-stone minerality. It is dry and full-bodied with rich texture and sprightly acidity.
Starts off promising, with some dark fruit aromas and an attractive tea-like nuance, then delivers simpler, somewhat grapy fruit flavors. It's full bodied, but with a certain reserve or austerity to its mouthfeel, finishing firm. Probably best in another year or two.

It's drinking quite well, with mature flavors of strawberry fruit pastry, lightly dusted with baking spices. The score reflects its limited aging potential, as the window for enjoyment seems already to be closing.

Butterscotch aromas are backed by a candied palate full of pear syrup. The mouthfeel is soft, and the finish everlasting due to residual sugar. Probably too sweet for most but not badly made. Imported by Freixenet USA.
Alcohol a modest 13%. Smells “dry,” dusty-woody, briary. Bits and pieces of twigs, spices, anise, tomato, cola, rhubarb. Old Pinot, very dry and brittle. Some sweet cherries, sweet oak, vanilla, char. Delicate and refined, though big. Still some dusty tannins. Now-2008.
Blackberry, soy, purple flower and caramel scents show on the nose of this bottling from a cool-climate vineyard. Deep blackberry and black currant fruit shows on the palate, accented with hints of beef char, lavender and thyme.

Grapes from two vineyards—Hyland in the McMinnville AVA, and Fortmiller in the Rogue Valley AVA—combine gracefully in a young wine with juicy citrus and ripe blackberry flavors. Eleven months in 40% new French oak adds dark chocolate around the typical earthy minerality of the Hyland fruit. There are substantial tannins, so give this extra aeration, or cellar for another few years.
D'Alceo is a drop dead gorgeous wine that oozes intensity, blackness, fruitiness, exotic spice and smoke. In the mouth, this beautifully executed super Tuscan is about as rich, smooth and opulent as they come. You'll love the lingering notes of mature berry, chocolate and espresso that drive the long, smooth finish.
Definitely full of peach aromas, and on the side you'll find accents of smoke, caramel and lemon curd. If that sounds heavy, it's not. In fact, this wine shows excellent balance. The palate is pure, with sweet pineapple and nectarine. And the finish is flattering; the mineral, chalky quality is just right. Purity is this wine's first, middle and last name.

This is almost jet black, saturated with color, and it goes deep with sweet, ripe black cherry and black olive flavors. The dark stuff is balanced by fresh acid, well-modulated tannins and a finish with pleasing texture and balance. It's muscular, herbal and smooth, with hints of coffee in the finish. Tastes even better after being open for 24 hours.
A light, easy Viognier　that's not oily like some versions of this variety, but pleasingly tropical, smelling of pineapple and guava with ripe melon on the finish.
From vineyards in the eastern Douro Superior region, this perfumed white is soft, smooth and finely balanced. The acidity is just right, giving the rich pear fruit a crisp edge and refreshing aftertaste. Drink now.
This shows the more racy, fresh side of Meursault. It's a wine that dances and jumps around the mouth. Light but still full of delicious green fruits. The wood is there, but it's such a delicate touch.
Bone dry, acidic and minerally, this isn't very Chard-like in terms of richness of fruit. But it's clean and pleasantly sippable, with modest apple and lime flavors.
With its Sauvignon Blanc in the blend, this is an herbaceous tasting wine, with green apple, and hay aromas. It finishes bright and fresh; drink now.

Sour cherry, damp soil and wet rocks frame this minerally-minded Pinot Noir from the coastal range in the northern part of the county. The palate is dominated by herbs, from oregano and thyme to fennel and licorice, with ripe cranberry framing the fruit profile.

Strong in primary fruit now. Overwhelms with the ripest blackberries, cherries and red currants, with lots of toasty oak, and a hint of herbs. The tannins are dusty and soft. Fine if you like your Cabs young, but should benefit from 3–5 years in the cellar.
Apples, spearmint and ripe white peaches, with refreshing acidity. Very clean, and a bit sweet on the finish.
Dark fruit aromas and flavors join with a generous texture and full body to make a complete and satisfying wine. This has just enough tannin to make it appetizing and well balanced.

This wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (65%), Merlot (25%), Cabernet Franc (8%) and Petit Verdot.

Especially considering the warmth of the vintage, it shows a lot of finesse along with a long finish.
This dry interpretation of the Cartizze cru shows chalky mineral notes with background tones of peach, honey, wild flower and lemon zest. The soft sweetness feels great next to the naturally foamy quality of the mouthfeel.

Peachy and waxy on the nose, with dry lemon and green-melon flavors. This is a small-production wine (1,000 cases total) that leans on core acidity to keep it propped and steady. It's not the most complex game in town, and maybe it's on its way to having seen better days even if 2005 was a benchmark vintage. Limited in its scope of flavors but lively courtesy of an extra boost of acidity.
Sticky prune, plum and black fruit appear on the nose of this ripe, luscious Sangiovese and Cabernet blend. The fruit seems very mature, especially in the mouth where the wine is chewy, structured and fruit forward. Drink it with ribs or grilled steak.

It's the kind of wine that's perfect for a summer day. You could put some strawberries in it, or make it a cooler with a dash of fruit juice. No insult to the wine, which is dry and zesty in acidity and very good. The flavors are a solid home run of citrus, green apples, honeysuckle and cinnamon.
Typical of the variety, this shows upfront aromas of fresh green pepper, eucalyptus, black pepper and blackberry. These notes are amplified on the palate, with cedar and earthiness adding dimension. The tannins are not shy, but are well-integrated and the acidity is zippy and playful, which lends to a long, enticing finish.
Kelley Fox, who also makes the Scott Paul wines, has a deceptively delicate touch with her Pinots. They may seem light and herbal at first, but on further examination there is plenty of fruit, and it's sufficiently ripe, just not jammy. Pure expression of the site, along with somewhat wild fruit and herb flavors, are the hallmark. The flavors of bright berry and spice enter gracefully and linger through the long finish.
Soft and earthy up front, this Malbec deals jammy, raisiny aromas and a note of charcoal. The palate is cushioned in feel, while flavors of prune and blackberry are ripe but also minerally. Blackberry and raisin flavors are at the center of a lightly herbal,  persistent finish.
For now, funky yeast dominates the nose. The palate, however, abounds with friendly yellow Mirabelle plum and mandarin notes, all pulled into beautiful focus by lemon freshness.

Rich aromas of meaty charcuterie provide a compelling reason to investigate this wine further, a largely varietal undertaking with 5% Merlot, aged two years in 80% new French oak. Chalky, dusty tannins add a smokiness and medium weight, before finishing with a touch of dried herb.
Cantaloupe, almond candy and orange blossom make for a sweet nose. The palate seems too close to orange juice and tangerine than the apple and peach that best defines Rías Baixas. But for anyone who likes fresh, pulpy juice, it tastes perfectly good.
A lovely wine, teetering on the edge of sweetness. The pretty apple, apricot, and honeysuckle flavors have a crisp, steely edge of acidity, and there's a rich streak of mineral and diesel that adds complexity.
While shades of slate and saffron lend complexity and nuance, this semisweet wine is more a showcase of sumptuous yellow peach and pear flavors. Its high-toned acidity and delicate, lacy mouthfeel make it irresistibly gulpable.
The Domaine des Perdrix is based at Nuits Saint-Georges, so this wine comes from the Côte de Nuits. It is richly fruity with layers of warm red fruits and soft tannins. Rounded and ripe, the wine is an instant success. Drink now.

A strong spice scent comes with a hint of vanilla bean. Fruit flavors of lime and fresh-cut pear are framed by an underlying minerality. As always with Willow Crest Pinot Gris, there is good penetration and length.
This is a fine Pinot Noir. May not be as full-bodied or fruity as some, but it's truly elegant, crisply refined, and thoroughly dry, offering raspberry, rhubarb, tangerine zest and Dr. Pepper cola flavors that are wrapped into a silky texture. Production was a low 820 cases.
Here's a focused and sharp Sicilian white that shows bright aromas of citrus, cut grass, kiwi and stone fruit.
The best thing about this wine is the acid-tannin balance. Sure, it's ripe in blackberry and blueberry jam and cocoa flavors, but so are plenty of other red wines.

Another 2010 Pinot marred by vegetal aromas. The chilly vintage took its toll, robbing the raspberries and cherries of their natural richness. Still, it's pretty good once you give it some airing.
Winemaker: Gary Jordan. This wine is a stunner, exhibiting superb balance between all the key elements–ripe fruits, bright acidity, integrated oak and a lush texture. Rich without being overdone, with attractive notes of toasted red apple and orange zest that are laced with hints of toasted nuts, salinity and chalky minerality. The palate is full and flavorful but not flabby or fat, with ample acidity that keeps the whole experience fresh through the long, toasty finish. Drink now–2022.
This wine is 100% Cabernet, coming from Seven Hills, Loess, Summit View, Yellow Jacket, Stone Valley, Ferguson and Pepper Bridge vineyards. Locked-up aromas of barrel spice, toast, herb, vanilla and dark fruit give way to rich but well balanced black-fruit flavors. Lightly grainy tannins offer sufficient support.
The Soberanes Vineyard is the source to well-regarded wines from Bruliam, Siduri and Bernardus. Lucia's 2011 is a good followup to their 2010, showing fresh, jammy cherry and persimmon flavors, brightened with zippy acidity and finished with sweet oak. Will benefit from a few years in the cellar.
A nicely made wine at an attractive price, this offers crowd-pleasing elements of juicy black cherry, cassis and cedar around smoky oak and a medium-bodied concentration that remains succulent on the palate.
The texture is a bit rough for a Pinot Noir, lacking the silkiness you expect. Instead, you get the briary, brambly mouthfeel of a Zinfandel. But the wine is very flavorful in cherries and red currants. Give it a decant and drink up with grilled beef or lamb.
Offering a light-toned taste of raspberry coulis with well-defined acidity, this is a soft, silky vineyard-designate with a lilt of orange peel. A wall of tannins guards the finish.

There's a dullness to the nose of this wine, followed up by punches of dark plum, chocolate and chalky tannin. Reserved on the midpalate, it finds a burst of chocolate to share at the end.
Here's one for the cellar, no doubt about it. Shows classic, old-fashioned Howell tannins, the kind that grip early and lock the palate down throughout. But you can't help but be struck by the immensity of fruit. Massive in sweet blackberries and black currants, liberally oaked, and with a core of minerals, it will develop over the next ten years, at the very least.
There is a touch of yellow mirabelle plum on the nose. The palate comes in with a more tart note of pith and zest. The slender body unites full fruit and lively freshness in a compact package, boosted by a little residual sweetness that nonetheless lets the wine finish dry.
Dark berry jam and smoke on the nose are followed by flavors of berry, smoke and pepper on the palate here. An assertive minerality ties it all together and offers balance and refinement. Overall, a stylish, classic Shiraz with food pairing potential written all over it. Think grilled steak or lamb.
Nina's has an oaky nose with roasted, nutty aromatics, and in flavor just teeters over the acceptable brink of enjoyable intensity. Lots of baked plum that's quite nice.
Pleasant flavors of cherries, raspberries and licorice, and a spicy finish. Feels too sharp in the mouth, though, with a cut of green acidity. But for the price, it's a pretty good Pinot.
Light to medium aromas of cherry and berry are fresh and snappy, while the palate has high acidity, light extract and crisp, almost lean flavors of cherry and red plum. A pointed but clean wine that will do well with simple foods like sliced ham or salami.
An aromatic blend of Viognier and Roussanne, with overripe pear, lavender and spice. Aged three months in French oak, the palate is full bodied and unctuous, with a bitter note on the finish.
There's a distinct grassy note of hay and alfalfa on the nose of this Croatian red wine. On the palate, there are pleasant notes of ripe red fruit and chocolate, but coarse grape tannins and a bold 15.5% alcohol content contribute to a rather harsh, disjointed mouthfeel.
Ample fruitiness is accompanied by an attractive tannin and mineral texture and well-integrated acidity. It's a rounded wine that is ready to drink, with red cherry fruits that are full and ripe.
Raw, green aromas suggest underripe fruit, green tobacco and green herbs. Following the nose, this feels astringent and clampy. Herbal flavors of plum don't taste as green as this smells, while the finish is rugged and tannic.
Using fruit sourced from old vines, this firm, tannic and concentrated wine has a fine balance between the dense texture and bright black-plum and berry flavors. Given its tannic structure, it needs to age, although it would be a great accompaniment to a stew if consumed now.
The intensely dark color, tight aromas of black pepper and clove, deep and very ripe fruit flavors and thick tannins add up to a big, bold wine that tastes more full-bodied than its moderate alcohol would indicate. It has vivid flavors like espresso, dark chocolate and a hint of candied fruit, yet is decidedly dry. It should be best after 2018, or enjoy now with hearty meats.
Ripe, full, sweet, oaky and even a touch confectionary, with a whiff of cotton candy blending with resin and spice from the barrels. The palate is superconcentrated, with blackberry and chocolate flavors, and on the finish the oak pushes things toward toast, coconut and burnt logs. Woody, but powerful and appealing.
Sweet in pineapple jam and pear flavors and very oaky in caramel and vanilla toast, this Chard is a little heavy handed. It would score higher if it finished drier and crisper.
Zesty orange rind and apple notes take center stage in this unoaked Chardonnay, unadorned by trimmings of wood or spice. Full bodied and ripe, its easygoing style is approachable. Soft acidity marks a plush, slightly clingy finish. Drink now through 2019.
Aromas of saline, apple cider and oak suggest moderate overall quality. This has a creamy, heavy mouthfeel and flavors of melon, apple and caramel. An oaky finish feels resiny and tastes woody and sweet.
With just 13.5% alcohol, this Cab marches to its own beat. In an era of gooey, late-picked wines, this one's dry, tight and tannic, obviously designed for the cellar. Clos du Val always has celebrated their Cab's ageworthiness, and such are the wine's fruity cherry flavors that it should do interesting things after 2008 and beyond.
So thick and rich that it seems to fall apart in the mouth in pieces. There's rum raisin on the bouquet and then backing aromas and flavors of prune, orange rind, toffee, peanut and chocolate. It's rich, sweet and unctuous from start to finish, but with just enough balance and acidity to keep it upright. Sincere and delicious.
Made from 50% Nebbiolo and 50% Pinot Nero, this informal but savory sparkler starts with aromas of red berry, toasted nuts and pink grapefruit. The bright palate offers red cherry, strawberry, walnut and a hint of white pepper alongside fresh acidity and persistent bubbles.

This wine is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon (50%) and Franc (43%) finished off with Merlot. A blend of Stillwater Creek and Stonetree vineyards, it leads with fresh herb, game, black cherry and barrel-spice aromas. The flavors are more reserved than the aromas suggest, pulling up toward the finish.

Inky in color, with exotic, gaseous and balsamic aromas of black fruits and iodine, this biodynamic Malbec-Syrah blend is funky, jumpy, tartatic and jumbled on the palate. Stew, somewhat sour and earthy berry flavors finish scratchy but with length and energy.
This is the current release of Grant Burge's Meshach, which is typically held back for additional bottle age—the already bottled 2005 will be released in 2010. It displays extraordinary complexity in its scents of tea, coffee, spice and marinated beef, but the primary focus remains on its elegant blackberry fruit. Try around 2010.
Generic peach and melon aromas are pleasant, clean and simple, while flavors of pineapple, melon, mango and kumquat are basic and sweet, almost like canned fruit salad. Finishes pithy, with some banana-like sweetness.
Spice and black plums are touched with hints of purple flowers and beet root in this ripe, supple Pinot Noir. Richness is offset by bright acidity and a fine, but firm, frame of tannins. It's an elegant wine with evenhanded grace.
Attractively ripe, this has a dense texture that's full of red fruits and soft tannins. With its richness, it is delicious and ready to drink now.
Nice nose, with clear aromas of bread dough, almond paste and pear. A bit brighter on the palate, where citrus and peach flavors are nice if not exactly imposing. Finishes with a hint of cream and banana.
A deft combination of spice, earth and dried fruit hits the nose on this bottling, with aromas of cinnamon, chalk, baked plum, mace and purple flowers. The mineral-driven palate offers lots of rocky flavors, with brick and chipped slate giving depth to wound-up cherry, red apple skin and turned-earth elements.
This Zin is made in the St. Francis style of dryness at the cost of extremely high alcohol. It's a good, lusty wine made for drinking with rich fare that will counter-balanced the heat. The flavors of blackberries, currants and peppery spices are very rich.
Elderberry and black cherry have a lovely tinge of iron oxide. Edges of tart, dark berries creep in, too. This is balanced and full of shimmering, intriguing fruit with layers of earth and minerality. An aromatic joy, beautiful already but with the potential to become even better 2017–2018.
Shows some pretty good acids and tannins, which makes the wine feel juicy and brisk in candied blackberry and cherry fruit. Finishes almost sweet, but not quite, with the tannins closing in and drying things out. The impression is of an immature wine, not showing well now. Give it 5–6 years in the cellar.
Raw, reedy aromas of currant and cherry lead to a rubbery, pinched palate. Cherry and berry flavors are generic, as is the finish, which has hints of brown sugar. The blend is Merlot, Bonarda and Malbec.
Once coaxed out of the glass, there is something ethereal about this Pinot Noir in its compelling, lifted nose of elderberry, wild raspberry and aromatic nettle. It is deceptively light on the surface with translucent veils of silky tannins that draw you in. While there is engaging verve right now, this will come into its own once time has revealed the deeper layers of fruit. Drink from 2016.
From the excellent 2007 vintage, here's a Chianti Classico that shows power and determination but not in an exaggerated way. In fact, it delivers a delicate lineup of cherry, wild berry and blackberry with light shadings of spice and leather at the back.
This is 100% varietal—angular and stiff, offering nicely woven scents of herb, toast, and black cherry. The flavors continue with hints of coffee, cinnamon, vanilla and tobacco.
This Syrah's outstanding feature isn't the ripe blackberry, cherry, currant, cocoa and smoked meat flavors, although they are delicious. It's the balance. The tannins are lovely, the acidity is just right and the finish is spicy and complex. The wine frames the Syrah argument in California in a new way.
