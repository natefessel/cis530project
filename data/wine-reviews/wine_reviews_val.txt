This is a pretty good value for a Pinot Noir from one of California's better districts. The wine is dry and balanced, with fine acidity framing raspberry jam flavor.
Dry, rich and enormously tannic, this Cabernet, grown right around the famous winery in the capital town of Napa Valley, has been crafted for longterm aging. It's ripe in black currant, cherry and mocha flavors, but those tannins are really tough and astringent. Hold until at least 2008.
Aromas of leather, grilled herb, wild berry and baking spice lift out of the glass. The full-bodied palate doles out raspberry confiture, ripe Morello cherry, dark spice and tobacco while densely packed, mature tannins offer support. Drink 2018–2023.
The aromas of this light-bodied wine are herbal and savory, while the flavors resemble melon and celery. It has a smooth style, with more of a ripe texture than a tart one.
A whiff of stewed berries comes across as raisin and prune on the nose of this jammy, ripe RDD. In the mouth, this is full and chewy, with chunky, earthy flavors of raisin and baked plum filtering into a minty, peppery finish that's jammy and smooth in feel. Drink before 2015.
Big, bold and bulky on the bouquet, with a truck load of ripe blackberry and boysenberry aromas that rightly announce that a fruit bomb is coming. Feels plump, round and structured, with soft tannins and compact flavors of berries, black plums and herbs. Finishes full, with a mild herbal accent.
This tangy, tasty wine has strong elements of citrus and tobacco, both indicative of top-tier Washington Syrah. Take one swallow and the flavors keep piling on. Candied citrus and sweet berry and white pepper and clove, a three ring circus of a wine. But it's not overblown, and it's all in proportion. The fruit is the star, as it should be.
Lightly volatile aromas are followed by cranberry, cherry and herb flavors that show intensity and freshness.
A zesty, citrus-accented wine that features aromas and flavors of lemons and limes, piecrust and minty herbs. Finishes clean and refreshing—a racy wine that nevertheless isn't lightweight.

An aromatic touch of freshly cut green grass and nettle hovers above the tell-tale aromas of Muscat grapes: blossom and citrus. The palate comes in with exquisite lightness, freshness and transparency, carrying refreshing aromatics on a vein of lemon zestiness. The finish adds green apple notes and leaves you wanting more. It's delicate but aromatic.
The Roessler brothers take a good spin through the historic Sanford & Benedict vines and present a wine with cherry, baked fennel and a bit of eucalyptus on the nose. It's fairly lean once sipped, but balanced well between pomegranate fruit and dark spices.
The alcohol level is very high, but the wine is very delicious, which is the tradeoff you get with this Zinfandel taste-alike. It's silky and soft and rich in jammy raspberry, cherry and chocolate flavors, finished with savory spices.

Simple, oaky and fruity, with pineapple jam, buttered toast and vanilla flavors. Made in a direct, consumer-appealing style.
This opens with delicate scents of field flower and white stone fruit. On the creamy off-dry palate, a soft mousse backs up sweet white peach, green apple and a candied citrus note while bright acidity lends freshness.
Aromas of finely ground black pepper, green herbs, orange peel and cherry are followed by tart, soft, sumptuous cranberry and savory flavors. The finish extends into the distance. It's all about feel and focus.
A showcase of Lodi's ability to grow an array of grapes, particularly red varieties, Incognito is an amalgam of Syrah, Carignane, Mourvèdre, Souzão, Tannat, Cinsault, Petite Sirah and Merlot, with flavors ranging from cranberry to chocolate. It's smooth, with medium body and tannic structure.
Oxidative, with unusual aromas but a more typical profile in the mouth, with rose, lanolin and lychee flavor. Off-dry but balanced. Drink up.
For $15 or less, you can't expect a great Pinot Noir, but you can expect a good everyday one, which is what this is. It's dry, silky and smooth, with cherry pie and white pepper flavors.
Very pure—this has a straight line of acidity right to the wine's citrus- and pineapple-flavored heart. It is structured and taut, with its acidity dominant. It is concentrated and ready to age for 2–3 years.
Staunch herbal aromas of tobacco, olive, rubber, vanilla, cedar and wild berry are 100% Chilean. This Carmenère-led blend feels fleshy but alert, with tomato-based acidity. Saucy, herbal, tomatoey plum and red-currant flavors finish herbal and briny, with snappy tartaric acidity.
A hint of waxy lemon skin lends an elegant tone to this dry, refreshingly crisp Riesling. The palate is bright, with Meyer-lemon acidity and hints of wet stone and crushed rock that linger on the finish.
Dry and firm in tannins, this has upfront blackberry, cherry, oak and spice flavors. It's a Cabernet Sauvignon-based Bordeaux blend with some Syrah, which brings a smoked meat taste.
A rather hefty version of a German-style dry wine, this has a rich texture and white peach and apricot flavors, all supported by tangy acidity. Kerner is the main grape variety in the blend, which is quite unusual in the U.S.
More from the big, friendly school of Syrahs, although a little generic in the final analysis. The bouquet is rich and a touch syrupy, but the palate features a solid core of ripe, deep black fruits. Not perfect but shows plenty of flavor, width, weight and fruit.
Muscadet has changed since we all rejected it in favor of New World whites. This French region at the mouth of the Loire river now makes clean, fresh, light wines which are almost certainly the best accompaniment to shellfish there is. This estate wine is full-bodied, with a touch of toast and soft, ripe fruit. Finely focused, it is complex with green fruits and ripeness combined.
Broad, ripe style, concentrated while retaining lightness of touch. There is a good mineral element balancing the yellow fruits and rich texture.

Soft and simple, this has a pear flavor, a touch of vanilla and a creamy texture, plus crisp, lemon-zest-like acidity on the finish. Drink this now.

Fruity wine from one of the best produces of Gamay in the Loire. Cherry flavors, bright acidity and just a touch of tannin on this youthful wine.
Good price for a dry, crisp and flavor Chardonnay with some real fancy character. Flatters the palate with opulent pineapple jam, pear, lemon and orange fruit flavors, finished with rich oak.
Using shriveled, dried Cabernet Franc grapes, this appassimento-style wine is a new endeavor in the Michigan wine scene, yet it might merit further experimentation for such a cool climate growing region. Initial notes of balsamic blow off to reveal notes of brandied cherries and dried hay. Medium in weight, with fine, sandy tannins, the palate is condensed and ripe in fresh cherry tones that linger on the finish. As a result of the drying process, the alcohol hits over 15%, yet beyond the roundness on the palate, it's quite imperceptible.
A purely fruity wine, without wood aging, this is soft and light. The red berry fruits are balanced with an herbal character that leaves an edge of green on the finish.
Heavy and soft. Tastes like chocolate milk with an infusion of blackberry syrup. Blended with a little Syrah and Zinfandel, for good luck.
Espresso, toasted oak, menthol, grilled herb and dried black-skinned berry aromas take center stage on this dense, concentrated wine. The opulent palate offers toast, espresso, mocha, black cherry marinated in spirits and vanilla alongside solid, velvety tannins. Drink 2018–2028.
Always one of Eberle's most pleasant wines. Rich in apricot jam, peach cobbler and spicy vanilla flavors, the wine is overtly sweet but with enough acidity for balance.
This is a soft, simple wine with apple and citrus fruits and a ripe character. It is young and ready to drink.
Aromas of tree bark, cola, mushroom and black olive get this Cab going, while on the palate it keeps that savory-over-fruity character by showing meaty, mildly herbal flavors. It's full, a bit tannic and grabby. But overall it has an honest feel and integrity.
This big but smooth wine has a seductive spicy, oaky aroma, rich and generous fruit flavors, a good layer of tannin to add mouthfeel and a lingering, delicious finish. The layers of flavor match layers of texture for an irrestible combo. 10% Cabernet Franc and 4% of the Portuguese variety Touriga Nacional contribute to the flavor complexity.
Blossom and steel aromas collide in this deliciously ripe yet nuanced semisweet Riesling. While luscious yellow cherry and apricot flavors penetrate on the palate, it shows lively freshness, amplified by breathless mineral vitality.
If you're used to Napa Cabs, this will come as a surprise. It's earthier, with dried cherry and herb flavors and lots of spices. The tannins don't try to hide themselves, but are in your face. Finally, the wine is dry and modest in alcohol. It's really interesting.
A light, crisp, fresh wine, with attractive lemon grass and orange zest flavors. It is juicy, the green fruits full of intensity. There is good minerality as well, underlined by toast from wood aging.
A letdown after the last few vintages, the winery's '05 has rough tannins and mint-infused currant flavors. It's dry, but doesn't seem quite ripe. Not likely to improve.
88-90 There is great fruit in this wine. It is black, dark and intense, but it has delicious ripeness balanced by fresh acidity to finish.
Your basic inexpensive California Chard: fruity, creamy and light, with pleasant peach, pineapple and apricot flavors finished with a touch of spicy oak.
This is a ripe fruity wine. It has weight and richness as well as intense acidity that cuts the ripe berry flavors. This is a food friendly rosé, full of fruit, produced from organically grown grapes.
For all the richness, and there's plenty of it in the pineapple, Meyer lemondrop and vanilla notes, this Chard has a gunmetal minerality that grounds it. The “Nu” designation indicates that it's unoaked.
Hazyblur has coaxed some expressive fruit out of the often recalcitrant Pinot Gris grape. There's lemon and pear here, set against a backdrop of almond and spice. Soft and light, this is one to serve poolside.
Give this young wine some time in the cellar to let the tannins drop out. Right now, it's a bit hard and astringent, although it's so rich in fruit that a good decanting will let you enjoy it. Shows a molten core of blackberries, crème de cassis, cocoa and cedar, with a mineral undertow. Dramatic wine.
This is a crisp, fresh and fruity wine. With its sliced apple, pink grapefruit and lemon-zest texture, it has both fruitiness and a hint of minerality from the schist of the Douro. Drink now.
Richly layered red fruit accents an explosion of firm lengthy tannin, alongside dashes of clove and cinnamon, in this hearty full-bodied red. Robust and concentrated, it shows oaky bursts of vanilla and smoke on the finish.
Still settling into its skin, this wine shows a light effervescence when first poured that lifts the notes of freshly cut pear, mandarin orange and wild flowers. It drinks off dry, with the concentration of the stone fruit flavors somewhat wanting.
Inky dark in the glass, this blend of 48% Syrah, 39% Grenache and 13% Mourvèdre offers up dense and potent blackberry and blueberry fruit aromas, enhanced by black pepper and bacon-fat richness. Blackberry fruit starts the sip and then it deepens into earth, tobacco and smoke. It's a fine study of darkness.
This wine is concentrated with ripe, juicy fruit along with brisk acidity and a delicious sense of Southern French herbs. The wine has weight as well, giving it fine aging potential. Drink from 2016.

Classic Petite Sirah from a warm climate, inky black, soft in texture and explosively rich in tannins. Extravagant in the essence of ripe summer blackberries and cassis, with a meaty quality surrounded by plenty of sweet, charred oak. Drink this robust beauty now with beef stews, barbecued spareribs, or even dark chocolate.
This is a delicious, soft, tropical fruit-flavored wine. The texture is ripe, full, the mango fruits melting in the mouth, just touched by spice. If it misses the more mineral character of Chablis, the pleasure is sufficient compensation. Screwcap.
Hug has succeeded in using Grenache as a blending grape, but this bottling, which is 80% varietal, shows the problems associated with the grape in California. It has cherry and mocha flavors, but falls short in structure and complexity.
A year in wood and 30 months in bottle before release have allowed this attractive wine to fully develop its solid yet smooth texture. It has concentration, layers of bright black currant fruit and vibrant acidity. Ready to drink.
Smoky and obviously wood-aged, this toasty, spicy wine has extracted black-coffee flavors that mask the black currant fruits. That leaves a wine that seems austere and with a bitter aftertaste. Drink from 2017.
Floral lead scents come with lychee and citrus aromas. Feels crisp, citrusy and tangy, with full acidity and lemony flavors of orange and lychee. Long, solid, driving and fresh on the finish. Drink as soon as possible.
It's pretty easy pegging this for Chilean SB; the nose is full of grass, lettuce leaf and bell pepper along with citrus. Feels fresh and deep, with good cut and pointed flavors of green bean and lychee. Runs heavy on the bell pepper and capsicum.
Full of both fruit and structure, this richly perfumed and spicy wine is impressive with solid tannins that are coming into balance with the rich black fruits. It still needs aging, so drink from 2018. The property is owned by a dedicated wine family that over the years tended the few remaining Malbec vines that survived phylloxera of late 1800s, were founders of the union to protect Cahors wines in the 1930s and helped revive the Confrérie des vins de Cahors. Alain Gayraud is the family's current owner.

The aromatics shine here, sending up a happy mix of ripe cherries and baking spices. The fruit carries the midpalate, with medium density and appealing, though blocky, flavors. This is not a complex wine, but most enjoyable.
A southern yet herbal-feeling wine, this is ripe—maybe overripe—and missing real structure or fruitiness.
Plush, fruit-forward and soft, Riserva di Fizzano shows a modern, confident style. The wine's appearance already shows darker hues of aging and the bouquet is characterized by dark fruit, leather and spice.
Bright and simple, this has delicate aromas of white stone fruit. The easygoing palate offers white peach and fresh apricot alongside fresh acidity.
Often seen as the easiest of the grand crus because of its richness, this shows more power due to the vintage. There is some tightness to the ripe structure, with white currant, pear skin and spice flavors. Finishes with sweet acidity.
Only two acres of Syrah are planted at the estate vineyard, which is a shame, as this makes you wish for much more. Just in its 4th leaf, the vines are already producing fruit with clear and complex varietal character. Bacon fat, smoke, licorice and a floral lift all come through on the nose. These flavors follow to a medium-bodied palate with proportionate structure and some persistence through the finish.
There's good concentration with this wine. It shows green apples, pears and green plum skin flavors. On top, there is wood, well balanced with the fruit; a sumptuous mix that shows the generosity of 2005.
Smells caramelly and Port-like, with raisiny fruit backed by drying tannins.
Cocoa powder, tobacco leaves and leathery spice all accent the black fruit soul of this wine. Ripe flavors of blackberry, cassis and juicy plum flesh flood the medium weight mouth, framed by a solid structure of gripping tannins that stay through the long close.
Much more mature and round than your typical Prosecco, yet it doesn't necessarily hit the right chords. There's a wheaty, burnt-grass quality to the fruit, smoke and toast, and then residual sugar. The goal here seems to be Champagne-like complexity and size, but the result is not fully convincing. Imported by Enotec Imports, Inc.
Light, with an underripe quality, showing tart berry flavors and green tobacco accents. Also has a substantial dose of the iodine-earth-vitamin character of some South African wines, off-putting when too prominent.
Sparkling reds may never be a strong domestic category, but some uniquely compelling examples have recently turned up. This one shows juicy and tart red cherry, plum, cola and shiitake scents, delivered with a yeasty touch. The foamy palate brings forth red cherry, earth and sourdough flavors.
A blend of various estates from the Paso Robles region, this wine shows roasted pork with blackberry hoisin sauce, black rocks and a touch of dill on the nose. Notable tannins provide lasting structure, with flavors of black olive, tobacco ash, peppercorns, dark chocolate and deep black fruit that will need a tad more time to unravel.
A firm and closed wine, packed with quince, pear, spice held in a mineral structure. It is potentially rich, but is still closed, needing several months to broaden out in all its richness.
Made with Sangiovese and 10% Merlot, this opens with aromas of vanilla, ripe plum and a whiff of coconut. The aromas carry over to the palate along with dried black cherry, licorice and roasted coffee bean. It's still tightly wound, with raspy tannins that leave an astringent finish. Drink soon as the fruit richness is starting to dry up.
The estate wine of Mouchão is serious, dense and complex. It is a wine that's made for the long haul, still with its youthful tannins that are balanced by juicy black fruits. There is a leathery texture developing alongside the fruit. It is dark and solid, likely to age for many years. Drink from 2020.
This leads with delicate aromas of violet and woodland berry. On the lively palate, a touch of almond adds interest the red-berry core. It's easy drinking, with fresh acidity and a light, tannic frame. Enjoy soon.
Shows the softness and earthy, herbal character that mark so many Napa Chards. Good new French oak adds flash, and you'll find some nice peach and pear custard flavors, but the wine wants more zest.
Here's a nice Rosso di Montalcino with brambly notes of forest berry and green leaf that follow berry and cherry fruit flavors. The wine boasts a firm tannic touch and good levels of acidity that make it perfect for pasta with wild boar or meat-filled ravioli. It's a bit thorny and sharp on the close.
An enormously fruity wine, it's impressive in Meyer lemons, limes, apricots, mangoes and vanilla, succulent and savory, and brightened by acidity. With almost the weight of an oak-aged Chardonnay, it shouldn't be opened too cold. Pair it with everything from ham and sausages and broiled chicken to arroz con pollo and Thai pork and peanut curry.
Aromas of apple, berry, pastry cream and bread dough delicately carry over to the crisp, creamy palate, along with Rainier cherry, citrus and a hint of baking spice. It's lovely and balanced, showing an elegant mousse and bright acidity.
This is a very mineral, fresh, grapefruity style of Viognier; it's got a lot of skin phenolics, and it really livens up the palate. Lime, tonic, citrus fruits and botanicals abound.
A candy shop of a wine, all perfumes and sweet fruit. Along with the fruit, there is a juicy acidity, but also some bitterness as the tannins creep in, giving a sharp aftertaste. Screwcap.
Ripe and oaky. May fall a bit short on complexity and finesse, but makes up for it in sheer power. Pineapple crème brûlée, spicy green apple butter, ripe pear, Asian spices and smoky oak are the flavors, backed with firm acidity.
A sharp herbal note permeates the crisp red fruit aromas. The wine is surprisingly smooth, and the tannins have a sanded, silky quality. The flavors are a pleasing mix of strawberry, cherry, milk chocolate and caramel.
This isn't a long-term ager, but do give it about a year in the bottle to let all of its parts meld together. Right now, it's tight and oaky. It features intense, bright pineapple, green apple and orange flavors, with sweet barrel influences and a tenuous streak of acidity.
You'll love the beautiful clarity of aromas that this pristine, fragrant wine offers: citrus fruit, peach, honey and sweet exotic fruit. It's definitely a compact wine with a streamlined mouthfeel, but those pretty aromas will get you in the mood for Thai lemongrass curry.
This wine is predominantly Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, with pinches of Syrah and Cabernet Franc blended in. Baking spice, cocoa and berry aromas lead to a layered cherry flavors that show intensity and persistence.
A pleasing rush of peaches, apricots, orange peel and lime greets the palate, as you first taste this young Viognier from the Milbrandt Vineyards in Washington's hot climate Wahluke Slope AVA. This wine has been deftly handled, accenting the lushness of the fruit, minimizing the phenolics, and giving weight and nuance to the midpalate. There's a hint of honey and toast as well, and the 14.2% alcohol feels just right.
Dark and fiery, with grapy, heavily extracted aromas. Compared to the winery's Premium Cabernet, this is harder and more choppy, with staggering tannins and heat on the finish. It's a monster with teeth, and only time will tell if it finds a friendlier place. Hold for a couple of years.
Aged for 36 months in barriques and 24 months in large casks, this opens with aromas of coconut, toasted oak and spicy blackberry. The palate offers sour cherry, mocha, tobacco and roasted coffee bean. The palate starts smooth and creamy but austere wood tannins impart a mouth-drying finish. Drink through 2022.
Nice complexity and vertical aromas of cola, licorice and cherry liqueur open the nose of this Riserva Barbaresco. The wine's aromatic characteristics are very much in line with classic Nebbiolo and there's a pungent or immediate quality as well. In the mouth, it shows dense, chewy consistency.
Blanc de Noirs, white Champagne only from red grapes, produces wines with some weight, as here. It makes for a rich, full-blooded Champagne, packed with red fruits while also cut through with intense acidity. The fruitiness gains shape from a zesty texture.
93-95 Barrel sample. Ripe, sweet and opulent, with bright tannins and fruits, a velvet wine, the tannins well integrated. Beautiful.
Dense and serious, a powerful vintage, as would be expected from Fonseca. The whole emphasis of the wine pushes the tannins forward, but this structure is based on black plums with dark fruit skins and a solid, chunky character. The finish is juicy and bold.
The '02 Exile had plenty of oak, and this '03 has its share as well (coffee, toast, spice, mocha—the works). This edition, though, has very juicy plum and raspberry fruit to back it up, along with smooth, suave tannins and a tangy cranberry finish. Hedonistic? Yes. An ager? Maybe not.  Drink up. Imported by The Colonial Wine Company Pty Ltd.
This is soft and ultrafruity, packed with a delicious blackberry flavor. Its minimal tannins and ripe character are brightened with a final shot of refreshing acidity. Screwcap.
88-90 Barrel sample. Light, ripe, fresh with pleasant acidity and the freshest of blackcurrants.
A very rich blush wine made from the same Cabernet grapes that go into the winery's expensive dry table wine. It's silky and wonderfully crisp, with deep flavors of raspberries, rose petals and vanilla spice. Wonderful with mushroom risotto, or with little puff pastry appetizers.
Traditional is the best way to describe this blend. It starts with tobacco and other sweet-leaf aromas, while the palate is lively and healthy, with mildly candied cherry and raspberry flavors. With hints of herbs, olive and tobacco, this comes across like a prototype Chilean red. Imported by Billington Imports, Inc.
The Mourvèdre is the most complex and substantial of the 2006 reds from Michael Florentino. It's a wine with hints of muscle and depth, its tart red fruits threaded around earth, pepper, smoke, caramel and mocha flavors. The wine persists without becoming harsh or hot, and the way it evolves in the mouth suggests midterm aging potential as well.
This is a top value, offering unusually rich palate weight and texture in a wine this inexpensive. Ripe stone-fruit flavors finish long, picking up hints of fresh herbs and leesy richness. Drink through the end of 2017.
Gritty aromas of match stick and nut skins blend with light citrus aromas. This feels plump but also vaguely citric, with lime and grapefruit flavors that finish well.
A bit soft and dull, but it's dry and silky like a Pinot Noir should be, with modest cherry and cola flavors.
A lot is going on in this wine from the Santa Cruz Mountains winery founded in 1981 by the late Tom Mudd. Today his work is continued by his kids, Karina and Jack Mudd, and winemaker George Troquato. The nose offers oregano and pomegranate-reduction sauce and flavors of black cherry, uplifting sage and licorice. Lingering acidity and a solid tannic profile make for a well-rounded, full appellation wine.
Talley has struggled with the acidity on this wine for years. Sometimes it's too soft. This '08, while very good, with a degree of complexity especially in the tannins, is too aggressive. The acidity feels unnatural, giving the wine the taste of raspberry sour candy.
Not an outright fruity wine, this has subtle earth and melon aromas, modest cucumber flavors and a rather soft texture. It is medium bodied and short on the finish.
Dark, mossy, rubbery blackberry aromas are solid. In the mouth, this is punishing, with raw tannins that suggest grapeskins. Dark, chocolaty, savory, spicy flavors of blackberry and black plum finish toasty but bumpy, tannic and rubbery.
Spicy scents introduce a fresh and fleshy pear-flavored Pinot Gris, with a crisp underpinning of wet stone and medium acids. Citrus peel, light orange and pineapple weave into the midpalate, and the wine fills the mouth without being heavy.
A sturdy structure of acid and tannins, this blends 70% Sangiovese and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon. Offering solid cherry and raspberry flavors, it is not too full bodied, but carries enough richness and depth to last on the finish. It makes for a nice dinner wine with all kinds of Italian food.
A larger offering from the producer from a selection of sites, this shows a prowess of blending in its grippy, classic elements of black pepper and currant, a focused display of savory edges around elusive fruit that makes for a compelling experience. Drink now through 2023.
Baked plum, purple flower, vanilla, blackcurrant and mocha aromas unfold in the glass. The concentrated, juicy palate offers ripe, black cherry, licorice, coffee and cocoa framed in round, velvety tannins. It's already accessible and will offer fine drinking over the next several years. Drink through 2022.
Approach this simple Tempranillo with modest expectations and the jammy cherry aromas and flavors will strike you as pure and fresh. Complexity and style are not part of the equation, but an unoaked raspberry character, length and correct balance make it worthy.
Lots of fresh, ripe fruit and spices in this dry, lusty Zinfandel. Flatters with wild raspberry, cherry, mulberry, pepper and baking spice flavors, wrapped into firm tannins. Great for BBQ. Drink now.
This overtly ripe white shows a generosity of guava and mango flavor—a tropical outpouring of perceptible sweetness that's wrapped in a boldness of body and vanilla oak.
Big and powerful, this is the grandest of the grand crus. It has both  a dense structure and overwhelming fruits. With minerality, spice and balance, this is a very complete wine. There is only a hint of the richness to come. Hold for 10 years at least.
Though 2014 is a fine, accessible vintage for many Oregon Pinots, this one is rather stubbornly shut down. At first it shows stem and herb flavors, along with chewy tannins. With hours of breathing time, the fruit emerges, a mix of rhubarb, cherry and a dash of cola.
Plush black-currant aromas meet with light licorice and a plum-pudding note on the nose of this 70% Grenache, 28% Syrah, 1% Mourvèdre and 1% Viognier blend. It dries up tightly on the palate, showing blackberry alongside strong licorice and violet elements, all framed by a chalky structure.
Scents of effervescent cherry and mint run with emergent licorice and slate on this wine that proves lithe yet flavorful on the palate. Lovely blackberry flavors and black pepper make for a very balanced bottling that doesn't rely on bombastic power to tell the Syrah story.
Bold and complex, this Syrah opens with intense, superrich notes of chocolate fudge, maraschino cherry, tobacco, sweet spice and rum cake. Smooth, elegant and persistent, this amazing expression boasts ripe fruit tannins. Drink after 2016.
This bright, structured Sangiovese opens with aromas of blue flowers, tilled earth, red and black berries. The savory, silky palate doles out juicy wild cherry, crushed raspberry, clove and licorice alongside supple but chewy tannins. Drink through 2019.
Made with organically farmed grapes, this wine starts with an unusual nose that recalls Asian spices, curry, rosemary and citrus. The palate is less exotic, offering lemon-lime and grapefruit lightly accented with clove.
The nose certainly doesn't grab out at you but it does deliver delicate floral notes, almond paste and ladies' hand-cream-like aromas. Because it appears a bit heavy in the mouth, it calls for tart foods such as endive salad with mustard-balsamic vinegar vinaigrette.
Aromas of herb, pear, apple skin are followed by spritely fruit flavors that linger on the finish.
This bright red blend from southern Italy offers modest aromas of black cherry, blackberry pie and crushed black pepper. The mouthfeel manages to be plush, clean and crisp at the same time.
Aromas of quince, piecrust and apricot transfer onto the palate, which feels soft, round and intense. Notes of apricot and white strawberry cobbler mark the slightly off-dry finish.
The warm vintage worked in this wine's favor, ripening the grapes to blackberry and black currant fruitiness, while preserving the dryness and fine tannins of Atlas Peak. At the age of more than six years, it still remains rather tough and resistant. Considering its mountain origins, it should slowly develop additional bottle complexity over the next 6–8 years.
The Camaspelo blend is 80% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Merlot, and it shows a riot of juicy cranberry, raspberry, blueberry and black cherry flavors in a rambunctious display of power. Full, round and balanced, it offers hints of cedar, earth and coffee that extend onto the lush, complex, age-worthy finish.
This is a very dry, soft Merlot. At the age of four years, it's fully resolved and ready to drink now. Shows polished cherry, currant, spice and cedar flavors, finished with a bite of acidity.
Although the wine has some richness and yellow fruits, the crisp acidity and lemon zest dominate. Fragrant and very fruity, it has some extra structure to allow it to age. Drink from the end of 2014.
Some deep stone fruit flavors, like black cherry, but this wine really comes down on the earthy side, with notes of chocolate and mint. The tannins are fine but substantial; you can feel them on the finish, which leaves the palate a little numb. It's not likely to age, though, so drink it with rich foods.
Opens with cherry aromas and brightness, then the palate fans out and fattens up with juicy plum and cherry flavors along with just a touch of medicinality. Toasty, warm and tasty, with a thoroughness not usually found in $8 wines. Garnacha at 70% with 30% Syrah.
Nose doesn't reveal much more than butter, or light coconut, aromas. In the mouth, there's an odd filminess to the texture, and flavors of gold apple that are punctuated by bright herb (and maybe some alcohol) on the finish.
The wine is powerful with fine tannins and concentrated black fruits. The dense texture is lifted by the acidity and beautiful fruit of the vintage. The tannins are dusty, tight and surrounded by beautiful fruit and acidity. This, the second wine of Montrose, will develop surely over the next several years. Drink from 2024.
Zesty notions of orange marmalade pervade the nose and palate, while overtones of passion fruit and faint spiciness hint at the aromatic nature of Scheurebe. It's broken up by more honeyed richness, while precise, lemony acidity brings all into a sharp, citric focus, with a clean-cut finish.
Quality at Kim Crawford has remained steady. The 2009 Sauvignon Blanc maintains its reliably herbal scent even while featuring hints of melon and fig. It's on the ripe side, hinting at stone fruit and honey but staying crisp and focused on the finish. Good value, should be widely available.

The Damilano is a modern take on Barbera; a big, very ripe, chunky wine that is easy to like.

Easy to drink now, but worth cellaring for a couple of years, as it will prove to be more interesting with some bottle age.
Tastes both underripe and overripe at the same time, with some polished cherry flavors in the middle. Lots of acidity makes it sour. A dry, somewhat rustic wine that rich meats and cheeses will help fatten.

This rosé is slightly confected on the nose, but boasts ample weight and richness on the palate, along with appealing notes of raspberry, white chocolate and citrus.
This historic estate certainly excelled with sweet wines in 2009. This auslese is lusciously sweet yet lithe, its ripe stone fruit—apricot and peach—balanced by citrusy notes. Finishes long and clean, not cloying. Delicious now, but should easily be capable of aging for 20–30 years.

Gerbole is a very distinctive Roero with power, heat and undertones of cherry liqueur. The mouthfeel is compact and lean with forest berry and bramble on the close. Pair this Piedmont red with creamy porcini risotto.

With savory aromas of soy sauce and beef broth, this is not only fruity smelling, it's meaty on the nose. The palate is full and voluminous, but not thick. Flavors of boysenberry and blackberry are slightly leafy and green, while the finish shows a good texture and grabby tannins.
There is a fine sense of structure in this dense and solid effort. It has both a juicy black-currant note and a full-bodied, concentrated texture. Showing the richness as well as the dry core of 2010, it is ready to age over several years.
Very rich and sumptuous, if a little heavy. It's delicious and complex, with cherry, mocha and red currant flavors that finish sweet and spicy. You'll experience a hit of tannins that provides structure, but makes the wine slightly unaccessible. Aging is a gamble, given a certain pruniness on the finish.
At the equivalent of about $6 a bottle, this is a good buy. It's made in the popular Chardonnay style, with pineapple, peach and spice flavors accented by smoky oak.
Syrupy and dense, this is a burly wine, soft but powerful, that keeps coming back to the theme of blackberry syrup. Velvety tannins buoy the midpoint, before it finishes in a burst of intense ripeness.
Though this wine offers the vibrant cherry fruit and pepper of a good New York Cab Franc, it's a bit one-dimensional. On the nose, candied cherry and spice lead, followed by a slightly tart wave of cherry. Oak adds just a bit of interest. Pair with duck or fowl to soften it.
Blackberry and black cherry fruit anchor this well-built Cabernet, accented with scents of sandalwood and smoke. The acidity keeps it vibrant and brings good definition throughout.
Delicate aromas of yellow flower and citrus lift out of the glass while the racy, linear palate offers grapefruit, nectarine and graphite alongside zesty acidity. It finishes crisp and clean.
A medium-bodied blend of Grenache Blanc, Bourboulenc, Ugni Blanc and Roussanne, this simple white from the Perrin family of Beaucastel offers fruity notes of melon and citrus that finish crisp and clean.
A wine from a château that is still finding its form . It is soft, open, with attractive juicy red fruits and black currants, ready to drink soon.
A bit flat and lifeless with a bouquet composed only of petrol and stone. A touch of honey might present itself to some, but the fruit character is sorely missed.
This blend of Bical and Cercial is toasty and dominated by its wood aging. Wood-derived spice notes cover its crisper green fruits.
Scorched soil, toasted oak, dried sage and roasted coffee bean aromas lead the nose. The approachable, full-bodied palate offers dried cherry, espresso and a hint of clove alongside fine-grained tannins. Drink sooner rather than later to capture the remaining fruit.
The nonvintage blend from this venerable producer is as balanced as all its Champagnes. It steers a fine course between acidity and crispness and a softer riper dosage. Blended with equal parts of all three main Champagne grapes, it is ready to drink.
Ripe and juicy, this is already an attractive wine. It does have a tannic structure for aging, but the bright red fruits, touches of cherry and layers of acidity are the stand outs. So drink this wine from 2015 or keep until 2020.
Kudos to Ste. Michelle for accurately labeling this wine, and also for the Riesling sweetness scale on the back of all their Rieslings. Firm Yakima Valley fruit is the backbone here, tart and spicy, with bright flavors of pear and apple. A juicy, palate-cleansing style.
Nicely complex, this offering combines cherry fruit with plenty of leathery, smoky and herbal nuances. In fact, one might argue there's a touch too much leather, as it seems to dull the fruit slightly, smoothing out any rough edges, but also lessening the fruit's bite. The wine is medium-bodied, with a creamy mouthfeel that finishes on a leathery note.
The best Pedestal since the 2003. The focus is immediately apparent, with dark, toasty scents and flavors wrapped into ripe black fruits. The generous (85% new) French oak aging brings in clove, licorice and smoky spice, but the fruit has the muscle and breadth necessary to keep it all harmonious.
This is Tendril's reserve offering, better than ever in 2014. Deeply inscribed flavors of black cherry, cola and espresso come through in a textural, detailed and quite delicious wine. It's the darkest of the winery's Pinots, barrel aged for 16 months and bottle aged for another year prior to release. Toasted nuts, crackers and a dash of salt complete the flavors.
This is Oregon Pinot from the Columbia Gorge AVA. This new region is still defining itself, but on first blush it's warmer, with more ripe, sweet strawberry fruit and very little of the herbal, resiny, tomato leaf character of most Oregon Pinots in this price range. This is sweet, jammy, spicy and thick, with fruit compote flavors dominating.
Dry and spicy, with some green peppercorn and vegetal aromas and flavors that interfere with enjoyment. A few modest blackberry notes rescue it.
Extended wood aging has deepened the gold color of this wine and brought out the old wood, old gold flavors. It is opulent, with plenty of acidity as well as spice and perfume. It is not the sort of wine to age in bottle, so drink now with dried fruits or blue cheeses.
Aged in older American and French oak barrels for approximately one year, this lacks the fruit to stand up to the bitter tannins. It's green and short, with little fruit flavor.
This is tartly sweet and jammy, like a cherry and roasted almond candy bar with a chocolate coating. Tasty, but a little one dimensional.
A old-vine blend of Encruzado and Malvasia Fina, this is an important wine. It has density, spice from wood aging and a wonderfully perfumed character from the Malvasia. The wine is structured with its concentrated fruit and toastiness. It needs to age and should not be drunk until 2018. Decant before pouring.
Closed cellar aromas burn off to reveal black fruit, baking spices and balsamic notes. The palate is subdued, showing raw cherry-berry, cooking spices and herbs alongside nervous acidity and astringent tannins.
Interplanted to Carignane, Alicante Bouschet and Grand Noir, this Zin vineyard hails back to 1895, a grande dame in the region, and is farmed by Ulises Valdez. The meticulous farming and winemaking are in full view, the wine velvety in blueberry and boysenberry fruit, while well-honed tannins and a full body announce its presence. On the finish is a satisfying streak of black licorice and pepper. Cellar through 2022.
This opens with aromas of cellar floor, moist underbrush, dried sage and a whiff of crushed violet. The robust but straightforward palate offers mature black cherry and a hint of dark cooking spice alongside close-grained rather fleeting tannins that leave a raspy finish.
A lovely Cabernet, dry and dustily tannic, with a complex array of flavors. The black cherries and cola are accompanied by firm mineral and earthy notes that make this strikingly different from your typical fruit-forward Cabernet, but then, the alcohol is a modest 13.7% by volume. All indications are of ageability. Could age at least eight years in the cellar.
Sourced from Rodgers Creek Vineyard, this is an ethereal, feminine Pinot, sublime in color and texture, bright in tart cherry. Brisk in acidity, it offers an undercurrent of dried herbes de Provence, cinnamon and exotic spice, evolving in the glass as it goes.
This has a surprising amount of vanilla cream in the flavors, plus soft, seductive raspberry fruit. The fruit comes from the oldest part of the Maresh vineyard—38-year-old self-rooted vines. The wine is a pale rose, yet substantial in the style of a classic Pinot from Eyrie. After some hours breathing it opens up with elegant, seductive aromas and some caramel streaks, delicate and perfectly proportioned.
Dry, minty oak aromas mix well with snappy plum and vanilla to form a proper, pleasing bouquet. The palate is fresh, vibrant and houses sweet, slightly spicy plum and berry flavors. Same on the finish, which is correct, spicy and dry.
Hints of almond and lemon rind lend complexity to sweet honeydew and white peach flavors in this featherlight Riesling. Lacy sweetness coats the midpalate, offsetting streaks of tart lemon-lime and grapefruit. It's a pristine wine best enjoyed young for its refreshing, quaffable style.
The 2011 Gold Label Monferrato Rosso offers delicious ripe fruit and spice. It's loaded with blackberry, raspberry, black pepper and licorice flavors all presented in an easy-drinking but enormously enjoyable style. This will pair with virtually anything and everything.
Soft and fruity, this Syrah is technically dry, but so fruity, it almost tastes like a candy. Shows red cherry, red currant, cola, roasted almond and licorice flavors, like a fruit bar you buy in the health store.
Musky aromas of lychee and orange are easy to peg as Torrontés. On the palate, there's zest and acid but not much substance. Tangy and tropical in flavors, and shallow in body, this is just o.k. Includes 5% Malbec for color.
Dry, full bodied and firmly tannic, this wine begs for some rich meat or roasted bird with which to pair. It has good, solid dark-berry flavors and a sense of breadth on the palate.
Shows plenty of bright red-fruit flavors of cherry and red currants. Yes, there's a hint of green pepper, but not so much as to be objectionable. It's more than made up for by the lush mouthfeel and ease with which this wine goes down.
Juicy, vivid black cherry fruit appears on the nose of this wine, with a touch of tar and brooding elderberry. The palate brims with those appetizing flavors and adds an edge of licorice to the fruit. It's fresh and vibrant, with a fine, taut, gossamer structure. A delicious Pinot Noir that's as elegant as it is refreshing and honest.
Roasted, leathery plum and berry aromas are a bit stalky. A blend of Tempranillo, Syrah and Garnacha, this is balanced on the palate but also juicy and alert. Blackberry and dark plum flavors come with an herbal, slightly stalky edge, while the finish tastes authentic but baked and leathery.
Syrah (64%) takes the lead on this blend, which is fleshed out by Grenache (27%) and Mourvèdre. It comes from vineyard sources rarely seen in a bottle at this price, including Boushey, Olsen, Les Collines, Stoney Vine and Destiny Ridge. Aromas of sage and herbs lead to a panoply of sleekly styled fruit and savory flavors, showing a pleasing sense of balance.
This may be the most serious California boxed wine on the market, showing great flavor concentration and an appetizing texture that's laced with fine-grained tannins. It has a deep red-black color, blackberry and dark chocolate aromas and a lip-smacking finish.
This is a slightly heavyhanded, throwback style of Chardonnay, with copious notes of buttered popcorn and a weighty, viscous mouthfeel. There's enough crispness on the finish to provide a sense of balance. Drink now.
Except for a splash of Syrah, this qualifies as a Cabernet-centric Bordeaux-style blend. Hard to find a better bottle of blended red wine at the price. This has grip and breed, with tart red fruits, ripe tannins, a wash of herb and tart acidity. Put it up against anything you grill.
Ripe and fruity, this rounded, open wine reveals its fruit quickly. Red berries and soft tannins complete the character to give a bright wine that will be ready to drink mid-2015.
This is a ripe, soft and warmly fruity wine. It has red cherry and strawberry flavors that lend a feeling of richness and roundness in texture. The acidity provides structure to this wine, but it is developing fast and will be ready to drink in 2015.
Here's a big, tough, tannic and dry wine, a classic example of a young Barbera that will live for decades. It will never be a great wine, but will soften and sweeten over many years, gradually yielding sweet dried fruit, flower and spice pleasantries.
Light with a floral, jasmine-like bouquet, this perennial classic shows lemony crispness around a medium-bodied core of juicy acidity and weight, remaining balanced and fresh. On the finish, expect a length and depth of fig flavor.
This base Amarone comes from a company in rapid expansion thanks to smart investments in the vineyard (100 acres) and winery. The nose is characterized by poached cherries, brown sugar and deep minerals that recall crushed vitamins. The length is good and so is the quality of its finish.
A fruity, black cherry nose is accented with leather and forest floor scents. The flavors follow, with smoke and licorice wrapped into the black fruits. Tannins show black tea and a hint of bitterness.
This refreshing, lively wine starts with a nose of citrus--grapefruit, lemon--and on the palate offers crisp but complex citrus flavors. Balanced and elegant, with a delicate touch. A great seafood sip.
This is a festive wine, with soft, ripe fruit and acidity, plus a red berry flavor.
Barrel-fermented, this wine shows a rich creaminess akin to Chard. But it's strictly PG, with crisp acidity and tart flavors of green apples, limes, pineapples, wildflowers and minerals. Finishes with a distinctly sugary taste.
Red plum and scratchy, herbal aromas form a decent bouquet. This Cab is modest and edgy in feel, with equally raw and edgy red-berry flavors that finish quick and punchy.
Boldly flavored, with massive doses of tart green apples pumped up by bubbles and a trace of sweetness. Simple and a bit sugary, it' would be a good base for "Champagne" cocktails.
Notes of anise and white blossoms perfume this gorgeously sheer Riesling. It's intensely sweet, bursting with honey, grapefruit and tangerine flavors, yet balanced neatly by high-toned acidity and a uniquely herbal flair.
Very ripe flavors of yellow pear gain focus on the palate where they are framed by grapefruit zest. There's an earthy pull, too, and lots and lots of texture.
“Pear” sums up the most obvious component of this wine's aromatic offerings. You'll find pineapple, peach and exotic fruit as well, but in much smaller doses. All in all, this is a fun and pleasant sparkler, made from aromatic Malvasia grapes, with an attractive nose and a lean mouthfeel.
While this wine shows some of the softness and richness of 2003, it keeps a light touch and the acidity and black fruits remain fresh. There is an edge of astringency that leaves a hard aftertaste.
Il Moro is a pure expression of Nero d'Avola (no wood is used here) with a satisfying emphasis on fresh berry tones, natural spice and soft tannins. The wine is smooth and soft in the mouth and offers a blast of fresh forest berry on the close.
A flinty note appears first, but juicy pear and ripe lemon take over. This wine is zippy, refreshing and defined on the palate. A lovely bitter background of pith provides just the right balance and a great canvas for rich food. It has an appealingly clean and dry finish.
Ultraripe, almost to the point of being syrupy and soupy. The nose is all sweet licorice, baked fruit and raisin. In the mouth, there's some tannic bite but mostly it's a rich, bruising, unctuous wine with smoky, rich berry flavors and a sweet, toasty finish.
Designed as a paring match to game foods and wild turkey, La Cattura is 85% Teroldego (a native variety of northern Italy) and 15% Syrah. This specific blend results in raw, milky tones of creamy blueberry and mocha.
From the La Consulta subzone of Mendoza, Altamira is a high-acid Malbec with floral, exotic aromas as well as vivid berry-fruit scents. The palate shows plenty of acidity, and thus the blackberry and blueberry flavors are tangy and borderline tart. Will age well but will never be a lush Malbec. Drink now through 2016.
This wine offers a bouquet of black cherry and butterscotch. Its cherry, blueberry and mint flavors are enwrapped in forceful tannins that give way to a finish marked by black fruit.
Stalky, earthy berry aromas are O.K. but lack freshness. This feels more flabby and heavy than vital, with stalky flavors of turned earth and stewed plum. A muddled finish is pretty much as expected given what's come before.
Violet, plum, leather and baking spice aromas merge on this easygoing red. The no-fuss palate offers black cherry, star anise and a hint of clove alongside polished but rather fleeting tannins. Drink soon.
Opaque in its deep purple color, this microchip-toting bottle fills the nose with the wet clay and menthol aromas. On the palate, graphite and black volcanic rock come with a touch of caramelized fruit and dark spices, such as black pepper, that take hold. Still rich with tannins, this will continue to emerge until 2024 if not longer.
Who says there's no drinkable wine for $6? This sweet-smelling, lightly leafy red is not shy and offers good body and concentration to support mildly medicinal plum and berry fruit. It's a touch hot on the finish, but for its class it works fine.
This is a fresh and light Extra Dry style Prosecco with a luminous appearance and tonic bubbles. The aromas recall citrus, white flower and peach and the bubbly wine would taste great as an aperitivo.
Saline and nettle aromas are a lot like underripe Sauvignon Blanc. This is a sour, cutting wine with flavors of lime, grapefruit and underripe passion fruit. The finish is overly acidic and citric.
Green pyrazine-based aromas of briny fruits and bell pepper are typical of Chilean Sauvignon Blanc. This feels lively and punchy, with citric acidity. Lightly spicy, peppery notes accent core lime flavors, while this ends with a bright and lively acidic finish.
An estate wine blended with 6% Sémillon, this was aged in 50% neutral oak. The texture provides the illusion of a bigger body and more power than it should have, given the alcohol level. It finishes in a twist of fresh tangerine.
A good, dry and flavorful Syrah, with lush blackberry, cherry and oak flavors. It's a harsh in the mouth, with some firm tannins, but a nice, fruity sipper to enjoy now.
Aromas of ripe plum, roasted coffee bean and espresso come together in the glass. A blend of 80% Sangiovese and 20% Merlot, the firm palate offers dried black cherry, espresso, toasted oak and grilled herb alongside assertive but fine-grained tannins.
This Petite Sirah has a strong aroma of farm and funk, and not much else to distinguish itself.
This wine is surprisingly brooding for the variety, with notes of jasmine, flowers and apricot struggling to get to the surface. The floral flavors are dry and light weight, providing intrigue.
Chanson owns four acres, a quarter of this premier cru. This 2011 is smooth, rich and very elegant. Fruitiness is striated by a mineral, tight texture that gives a touch of steeliness. Drink from 2017.
The name is apropos, for this is a big, fleshy wine, almost like one of those Aussie Shirazes in jammy fruit, although it's Cabernet all the way with blackberries and currants. With fine tannins and a smooth finish, it shows quite a bit of sophistication.
Here's an inky-black Barbera with impossible extraction and rich tones of blackberry, smoke, mineral and currant berry. This is a modern expression of a native grape from Piedmont with an extremely chewy, raw and sweet sensation on the close.
Light, fresh and fruity, this is an immediately attractive wine. Apple and citrus dominate with a tang of orange zest to add an extra refreshing character. Not for aging, ready to drink now.
Hints of rubber, iodine and graphite accent concentrated blackberry aromas in front of a chewy, pruny palate. Flavors of rubber and herbs share the stage with prune and raisin, while the finish is rich and plodding, with depth but limited complexity. Drink through 2018.
Squeezed lemon rinds and a faint whiff of petrol show on an otherwise reluctant nose from this off-dry wine. The palate reveals a racy, finely focused acidity that zings across the palate, hiding the residual sugar at first before allowing the ripe nectarine and apple soufflé elements to carry the flavors.
Green pear and yellow Mirabelle plum are lifted by zesty lemon freshness on the nose, promising both fruit and refreshment. The palate gathers these flavors up in one juicy sweep with its slender body. The mouth tingles with citrus freshness, finishing dry and clean.
This is soft and almost weightless, with no aromas and a midpalate that drops into a black hole. It's not that there are any off flavors; just that the search for flavor is, to put it bluntly, fruitless. Rare to find a wine with such a gaping hole in the middle.
The second vintage from this spectacularly restored estate in the upper Douro shows greater intensity, the fruits concentrated, ripe, full of bright berries. It has plenty of richness, maybe not hugely complex, but likely to develop well over 2–5 years.
This is a wine with good wood aging, a delicious perfumed character and firm tannins. It has weight and richness, with spicy Syrah lending an exotic feel to the wine. Drink from 2016.
With aromas of moss, balsam wood, baked berry and earth, this is a complex, interesting Rioja that's overdelivering for $20. The palate is lush, soft and easy, but also pure and flavorful as the fruit runs deep and meaty. Finishing notes of licorice, dark spice and lasting berry fruit will make you happy you went here. Drink now through 2013.
This is a lovely example of Grüner's potential in New Zealand. Varietally distinctive celery leaf and stalk aromas and flavors are rounded out by hints of melon. There's a bit of creaminess on the midpalate, and while the finish is spicy, it's not quite white pepper. Still, a solid effort.
Made from Pinot Noir vinified like a white wine, this fruity, fresh wine is a shade off dry. On the palate, hints of cherry and blossom, accent zesty grapefruit and lemon flavors. The finish is refreshingly dry. Drink now.
Charred oak characterizes the nose of this wine from an estate just 12 miles from the Pacific Ocean, but chopped dill takes the place of overpowering butter aromas. The herbs show up on the palate, hovering on pine needles, sandalwood and oak toothpicks, with lime pith keeping it fresh.
This is a ripe wine, with attractive red-berry flavors and acidity. It has a good sense of structure, solid with balanced tannins and ample acidity. The wine is developing well and should be ready to drink from 2020.
Co-released with the '04, but the wine is tired. It's already showing old flavors, with an earthy, herbal undertow.
This northern vineyard location delivers more herb and pine needle character than warm fruits, but you'll find elegantly defined cranberry and sour cherry mingling with leaf and cinnamon. It's not exactly delicate, but it is crafted for nuance more than power.
Massively fruity, this is an apple/pear bonanza, fleshy and almost lasciviously delicious. The huge fruit flavors convey an impression of sweetness, though this is not identified as off dry. It has tremendous density and length.
Dry and balanced, this young wine has a steely mineral tang to the fruitier flavors of ripe yellow apricots, tangerines and baked green apples. Oak adds smoky, spicy wood notes. A very nice Chard at a good price.
Very fresh, fruity and drinkable, this is a soft, red-cherry-flavored wine. Attractive acidity bursts out of the glass with a perfumed, tangy aftertaste. Drink now.
Every once in a while, wine writers are awarded a producer like David Sterza: young, relatively unknown and full of promise for the future. His Amarone is a genuine “discovery” with beautiful, bright fruit, good cheer, cherry cough drop, red apple, coffee and dried herbs. This is a bright, lively wine and a wonderful expression of the territory.
Shows the tobaccoey herbaceousness and soft tannins of Alexander Valley, with polished cherry and red currant fruit brushed with smoky oak. This lovely, easy-drinking but complex wine should develop in the bottle over the next six years.
Rich and delicious, this has flavors of pineapple tart, lemon meringue pie, buttered toast and smoky butterscotch that are balanced by fine acidity and dry, firm minerality.
This is a unique and exciting take on California's historic grape from one of the region's pioneering wineries. Aromas recall sour cranberry, orange peel, strawberry and sagebrush. It's savory and herbal on the palate, with baking and Indian spices of cardamom and chai as well as mocha.
Apple and citrus aromas are accented by a floral hint of bath soap. This is a mid-level Chardonnay that's unexciting but not bad. Melon and pear flavors are low on oak and devoid of complexity.
88-90 A definite mineral character here, with a wine that boasts a taut structure, pushing beyond the metallic edge of the fruit.
Made entirely with Sangiovese, this straightforward wine offers aromas of forest floor, violet, red berry and spices. The juicy palate delivers ripe black fruit accented with notes of white pepper, cinnamon, black tea and clove alongside firm but ripe tannins. Enjoy this now through 2018.
Aromas of pencil eraser, green herbs and briary berry fruits are oaky and pack some punch with this full, blocky wine. Flavors of blackberry are woody and slightly green, while the finish is peppery in flavor, spicy and shows some heat.
This beautiful wine includes 9% Cabernet Franc that gives a lift of floral violet and grainy cedar. Classic all around in its etchings of coconut shavings, graphite, spice and dust, the fruit is additionally savory in bright red currant and a crunch of cassis, with an underpinning of soft, succulent blackberry.
Made from a tiny vineyard north of St. Helena, the 2004 represents the inaugural release from this winery. It's a very promising start. Made from 100% Cab, the wine is polished and delicious, showing black and red currant, plum and spice flavors, with hints of cola, tangerine and licorice. Rich in acids and tannins, it should age gracefully through 2012, at least.
Dense, with plum-prune, coffee and chocolate aromas, this wine offers very ripe dark-fruit flavors accented by tobacco and cedar shadings. The mouthfeel is big, but very easy, even soft; with a little more spine-acidity and tannins-this wine could merit a higher score. Still, it's a very pleasing and promising first offering.
Aromas of Sorrentine lemon and pink grapefruit are followed by peach and mineral. This Greco di Tufo is easygoing and straightforward and offers a natural ability to pair with light, lunchtime recipes.
On its own, this is dry and earthy, with a taste of Middle Eastern hummus, apricots and oranges. It's certainly offbeat, but it can certainly be paired with food. How about hummus with teriyaki salmon?
From the Oak Knoll area, this is a super-oaky wine, bursting with vanilla and char. The underlying fruit isn't really big enough to sustain it, though. The wine is earthy and soft, leaving the oak to dominate.
With only 10% new oak used for this cuvée, there's just a hint of vanilla here; the aromas are dominated by black cherries and dusty spice notes. The flavors follow suit, picking up a bit of blueberry as well, delivered via a silky-textured palate. Finishes crisp, making it a good candidate with burgers or chops. Drink now–2015.
If you like oaky, creamy Sauvignon Blanc built along Chardonnay lines, this one's for you. Lemon-and-lime flavors, really bright and pure, stand out sweetly (it's actually dry). But barrel fermentation and lees aging add an extra layer of buttery richness. It's not an ager, but it sure is delicious now.
Red-berry fruits dominate this still-young wine that has dark tannins and concentration. Spice and wood-aging flavors still show strongly. Drink from 2019.
This interesting wine is a blend of Cabernet Franc and Merlot, with a drop of Cabernet Sauvignon that seems to give it a bit of needed power. Still, it's soft and melted. While the currant, red stone fruit and licorice flavors are delicious and complex, it lacks structure. Drink up.
The XY Reserve from Stevens is the best of an outstanding lineup of cellar-worthy, Yakima Valley red wines. Both elegant and powerful, it opens with a well-finessed bouquet of funk, fruit and flowers. The mid-palate brings compact black fruits, beautifully-structured with firm acids and fine tannins. This may be decanted and enjoyed immediately, or cellared indefinitely.
An expertly balanced take on this variable grape, this bottling shows tight aromas of wet concrete, scratched Meyer-lemon skin, yellow melon, poached peach, almond and a touch of salted lime. The palate is high and tight, bound by citrusy acidity, slowly revealing sunflower-seed warmth and ripe nectarine flavors.
Always a very dry, elegant Pinot Noir, Signorello's '08 Las Amigas again displays those qualities. It shows dried raspberry, cherry and cola flavors, with a distinct minerality and a dusting of tobacco and black pepper. This fancy Pinot is a natural lamb or steak.
While it is a full-bodied wine, it retains a great mineral character, very tangy, zesty. It is fresh, lifted, with the purest white currant fruits and ethereal aromas. Age for 3–4 years.
This is a little jammy with fruit, while also a little hot, but pretty good for the price. Marked by flavors of raspberry jam and red currants, it's a nice, medium-bodied and balanced wine.
This earthy wine unfolds with aromas of wet soil, leather, underbrush, mature black fruit and just a whiff of barnyard. The warm, dense palate doles out overripe and sugary black cherry extract, milk chocolate and cinnamon.
The beauty of this wine is that it shows seductive power and personality. Nothing is over the top. Cortevecchia Riserva doles out carefully measured aromas of forest fruit, spice, toasted nut and tobacco. It feels linear, bright and tight, but it is also elegant and soft.
There's a ripe note of strawberry jam or blackberry pie that opens this darkly concentrated effort. It shows a soft, plush texture that would be nicely offset by a piece of charcoal-grilled red meat.
There's no Merlot in California that's richer or more decadent than this. The flavors of cherry pie filling, cassis, red currants, chocolate, licorice and smoky oak are totally delicious. Granted, the wine is a little soft, with a melted texture, and classicists will complain it's made in the International style. They're missing out on a real hedonistic pleasure.
A fifty-fifty blend of Nero d'Avola and Syrah, this accessible wine offers aromas that recall tilled soil, black-skinned berry, blue flower and spice. Notes of chocolate and pepper accent a fleshy core of black cherry framed in soft, round tannins. Drink soon.
Super-tannic. You can taste the astringency of the grapeskins in the sandpapery mouthfeel, and some of those tannins probably come from oak, too. Under all that, you'll find a rich vein of cherries, mainly red, with an infusion of red currants. Could age, although it doesn't seem likely.
Briary aromas start with some funk and animal then settle down and clean up. The palate has a nice, layered feel and earthy flavors of berry, cassis and herbs. Finishes long, chocolaty and spicy, with freshness. 60% Malbec with 30% Cabernet and 10% Syrah.
For several years running this wine has failed to show any improvement. It remains a strange rendering of Syrah/Shiraz: it's saucy on the nose and palate, yet the feel is high-toned and narrow, with tang to the finish. Shows minimal pleasantries and requires too much digging to find them.
The fruit flavors are apparent, fresh and lively in this medium-bodied, beautifully balanced brut. Light pear and pineapple aromas are followed by richer pear and citrus flavors, and subtle hints of baking spices, almonds and a nice earthy touch emerge.
The wine feels light, with tannins that are edging on lean. The bitter cherry and dark plum fruit flavors give a vivid acidity and freshness, leaving the stalky tannins balanced with the acidity.
The second wine of classed growth Rauzan-Gassies in Margaux is ripe, soft with touches of licorice, wood aging and spice. It has attractive, forward red-berry flavors and the tannins of the 65% Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend. It is ready to drink.
The juice here seems good, with dark cherry, licorice and chocolate elements, decent structure, and fine tannins. However, you need to get past a strong sulfur component on the nose that just doesn't yield.
Feral and smoky, this light-bodied, light-colored estate-farmed wine gives way to dark cherry, white pepper and pronounced floral elements of rose and violet. Given time in 35% new French oak, it's structured and intriguing, with a tannic punch on the finish.
High-toned fruit and a twist of kirsch, red cherry and pomegranate provide a bright freshness to this mountain-grown wine, as unexpected as it is inviting. Dry wood tannins belie a powerful weight and body, buoyed by the acidity. Drink now through 2022.
Not as darkly concentrated or marked by rancio as the Rare bottling (but considerably less expensive), this is still an excellent sweet wine. Earthy notes of caramel and mocha dominate, rounded out by candied dates and wrapped up by a long, coffee-tinged finish.
A terrific Sauvignon Blanc, this is Mayacamas's best in years. Bone dry and rich in mouthwatering acidity, it shows subtle layers of lemons, limes, oranges and spices, with a bitter grassiness that gives it a perfect bite.
The wine is dry, dense although with a fine fruity potential. Underneath the dry texture, the wine is full of black-currant fruitiness. The vineyard is managed by Jacques Chardat and winemaking by Grégory Dalla Longa. Drink from 2019.
At 5 years, this wine remains tannic, with modest blackberry and oak flavors. Turns dry and astringent on the finish, and not likely to go anywhere, but it's okay.
This wine smells smoky, minty and almost meaty. It tastes rich and complex, brightened and spiced by lavish use of new oak, yet built on enough ripe blackberry flavors to achieve a robust balance. It's well made in a deliberately oaky style.
Baked boysenberries, purple flowers and baking spice show on the nose of this widely available bottling. The palate is quite minerally, with crushed lava rocks, followed by cooked elderberry, black-cherry pie and a touch of clove.
Blue fruit and herb aromas are followed by full-bodied blue and purple-fruit flavors. The balance is spot-on and the finish lingers.
Clean nectarine and red plum aromas open this quaffable Garnacha rosé. Lightly salty stone-fruit flavors are pushed by bright acidity, which is about all that remains on a racy but mostly tasteless finish.
If forced to drink too much of this clumsy, grassy, horsey smelling blend, you might be a dissident, too. This is sticky and cloying on the palate, with sweet, candied, herbal black-fruit flavors that finish under a covering of residual sugar.
Red-violet in the glass, this wine has a nose of black cherry, cocoa and freshly ground coffee. It is soft on entry, but velvety tannins and flavors of blackberry, vanilla, espresso bean and a soft hint of cocoa powder render it a more sophisticated quaff than first sip would suggest.
It's impressive how exciting old vine Carignan can be, and what an underrated grape it is. Here's proof that it makes big, perfumed wines, layered with dark tannins and wild flavors of herbs and dark berries.
Graphite, wood grain, spice and black-fruit aromas are full and a touch funky. Tight, crisp and direct on the palate, this Syrah sports a good mouthfeel and toasty, herbal flavors of blackberry and mixed hard spices. Baked berry fruit flavors and chewy tannins are wrapped in an oaky finish. Drink through 2018.
This is a smooth, approachable and straightforward wine, unfussy in its offerings of buttery toast and oak, the fruitiness derived entirely from the tropics.
89-91 Barrel sample. Formerly belonging to the Moueix family, this wine is now firmly in the hands of Cheval Blanc. It is a densely structured wine, the fruit rich, smooth opulent in character. There is a great fresh juiciness to finish.
Black cherry, currants and plums on the nose lead into a delicious balance of olive, plums and herbs on the palate. Dried currants, crushes stone and leather are also in the mix, with a chalky finish keeping the wine on track. Keep this one in the cellar or drink now with lamb or olive tapenade.
Earth and undergrowth flavors are woven through the rich pear tones which begin to shine with great, slightly sweet ripeness when exposed to a little air. The phenolic texture provides a counterpoint, supported by lemony freshness. Lovely balance.
Smooth, dry and full bodied, this subtly floral wine has a rich texture that soothes and coats the mouth. It should make a nice pairing with everything from spicy Asian or Latin American cuisine to sausages and sauerkraut. It smells like roses, tastes like pink grapefruit with a dash of kiwi, and has a long finish.
A simple hamburger or pasta dish is your best bet to pair with this good, straightforward Zin. It's dry, acidic and rather thin with wild berry, raisin, cola and oak flavors.
Dripping in earth, kir and fresh raspberry, this is a stellar wine from the heart of the appellation, estate-grown from a four-acre spot planted to a trio of clones. Spirited and refreshing, it dances in acidity and a floral back note that's compelling, wrapped in cinnamon and mocha.
Ripe berry aromas show a note of prune as well as mocha and vanilla scents. Tight clampy tannins roughen up the mouthfeel on this Maule Cabernet, while a fairly heavy wood element blends with flavors of herbal berry fruits and beef jerky. This is a full-volume wine with a full-volume finish. Drink through 2020.
A smooth and soft wine, this is packed with ripe fruit and attractive balanced acidity. There is a layer of caramel as well as spicy raspberry that give the wine extra warmth. Drink now.
Yellow in color, then fleshy and floral on the nose, with a hint of peach but also corn stalks. Feels full and clumsy, with sharp acidity and corny, cidery key flavors. Struggles to reach that next level.
Kudos to Kados: Here's a lovely and surprisingly sophisticated white wine from Sicily (made with the native Grillo grape but fermented in oak for extra spice and zest) offered at an equally surprising low price. Great with fish or spaghetti con vongole, the wine shows light pulses of yellow flower, peach, white mineral and almond.
Definitely sweet, syrupy and raisiny. Torres has made a chunky, plodding wine with saturated berry and plum flavors but hardly any of the mineral, schist, zest and excitement the Priorat is renowned for. Deep, dark and dense for sure, but ultimately flabby and mediocre. Imported by Dreyfus, Ashby & Co.
A ripe, crisp, yellow- and white-fruit-flavored wine. It shows taut minerality, the flintiness you find in Chablis. The structure is dominant in what is still a young wine, but the fruit is all there. Worth aging for a year.
Pulled together with fruit from a mix of estate vineyards, this wine boasts delicate flavors of raspberry and pomegranate with light accents of barrel toast, along with substantial acidity. It's tart, clean and simple.
Soft and plump, with chocolate-cherry flavors and some dried herbs. It's a somewhat rustic wine that's at its best now.
Grown in Calistoga, this is textbook Petite Sirah: It's black as a moonless night, bone dry, intensely tannic and enormously packed in fruit. Those tannins really lock the wine down in astringency, but they can't hide the massive burst of blackberry, cassis liqueur, mocha, crispy bacon and black pepper. Nowhere near ready to drink, it's a wine to be cellared for 5–6 years, at the very least. It should glide through the decades effortlessly, gradually losing tannins and growing more clean and pure.
Billed as a Cabernet lover's Merlot, this wine offers robustness as well as a soft, angular quality that provides a certain level of elegance. Oak, green olive and sage mark its bouquet, followed by flavors of red currant and dried herb.
Sweet and sugary, with flavors of pineapple, pear and apricot jam. Crisp acidity provides fresh balance.
This is a delicious Amarone boasting black-cherry and plum-cake flavors layered with cinnamon, nutmeg and notes of vanilla and well-integrated oak. With its chewy tannins and freshness, this will develop complexity over the next few years. Drink after 2016.
Thierry Hamelin has produced this wine specially for the Xavier Flouret range. It is lightly perfumed with white-flower aromas and has a mineral texture and delicious, refreshing citrus flavors. Full of tangy fruit and acidity at the end, it is a wine to drink now.
A blend of Chenin Blanc (75%), Chardonnay (20%) and Viognier barrel-fermented in French oak and acacia, this wine brings notes of dried apple and flowers, drinking off dry.
Smells a little funky and leathery, with an exaggeratedly sweet taste to the blackberries and cherries. The end impression is of a wine that's certainly ripe, but a little awkward, maybe even problematic. Seems best now.
Made from 89% of the indigenous grape Karasakiz and 11% Merlot, this wine presents scents of strawberry and orange blossom. It comes on bright with flavors of cherry and clementine, but as smooth tannins coat the mouth, notes of anise, violet and smoke join the chorus. The finish is also bright, with lingering flavors of smoke and flowers.
The grapes come from a vineyard in a part of the sprawling Sonoma Coast appellation that has yet to prove itself. The wine is ripe, with delicious cherry and raspberry-pie-filling flavors liberally accented with the sweet toast and vanilla notes of oak. There's an obvious appeal of deliciousness, and while it doesn't tire the palate, it doesn't offer extreme complexity. Drink now.
From an estate vineyard, this wine is somewhat unformed and quite feral, largely tannic, with a rough-hewn texture. The oak is overwhelming and needs time to settle, to better reveal the abundance of strawberry and cherry fruit.
This Roditis-Sauvignon blend starts with a soft, floral nose of lemon and peach and leads into crisp but rich flavors of citrus and flowers. Simple but a good everyday white, especially with light meals.
Yeasty, savory hints pervade nose and palate in an intriguing fashion, along with white pepper. The fruit is still subdued and lemony freshness is prevalent on the superlight body that nonetheless shows plenty of Grüner character. If you like zippy wines, you will fall in love with this.
he bouquet smells jammy and not that exciting. In the mouth, freshness takes over, but the acidity is hard. Flavors of wild berry are spicy and continue into the finish, with oak making itself known.
This 100% Cab is a big, rich wine, and while its power is considerable, it lacks subtlety. There's no question about the intensity of blackberries, cherries and spicy persimmons, unrivaled anywhere in the world. Yet ripeness isn't everything. Hard to see this explosion of fruit going anywhere, so drink soon.
Rich and briary, with that exotic, hot summer afternoon fresh berry tang, this Zin delights for its flavors of wild blackberries, currants, cherries, mulberries, chocolate, anise and pepper. So clean. You can taste the summer sun in every sip.
Pressed cranberry, underripe raspberry and white pepper form the alluring aromatic base for this bottling that dives into Kalamata olive and cardamom notes on the nose. There is great energy on the sip, with anise, buzzy Sichuan peppercorn and Indian spice enlivening the tomato leaf and cherry-tomato fruit.
After eight months on lees, this unoaked Chardonnay has picked up some mildly nutty, custardy qualities that give added heft and nuance to its pear, pineapple and melon fruit. Drink it over the next six months or so.
The winery brings precision control to Zinfandel, a wine that badly needs some taming but in most cases is allowed to run wild. Here, it has an almost Cabernet-like clarity, with focused tannins and acids and a balance that makes it elegant. But the wild blackberry, blueberry and spice flavors, with a briary, brambly edge of pepper and green stems, are pure Zin.
This maverick wine looks cloudy and orange in hue and offers citrus zest and peach skin aromas. That's because it was fermented with the grape skins, like a red wine. A plethora of flavors comes through on the palate, from peach and almond to jasmine and prosciutto, and it has a mouthfilling texture. Know that it's not a mainstream wine but enjoy it anyway.
Campo Inferi Riserva Amarone opens with very sweet and beautiful tones of red fruit candy, raspberry jam, nutmeg and cinnamon. It offers more rich sweet fruit flavors in the mouth and would pair perfectly with honey baked ham with cloves.
Grapefruit and other citrus aromas are zesty but standard. That's also how the palate comes across: citric and juicy, but average. Flavors of orange and tangerine finish fresh but continue the one-note theme.
A soft, nicely oaked Merlot with flavors of baked plum and ripe blackberry. Full-bodied in every sense of the word, with just a sprinkling of spice on the finish.
Generic, slightly soapy tropical fruit and cured-meat aromas smell oily. This is not flabby, with soft flavors of melon, papaya and lychee. A mild finish with some bitterness doesn't offer much snap or zest.
This is 100% varietal, from the Loess, Seven Hills, Pepper Bridge, and Mill Creek Upland vineyards. A deep, intense take on Merlot, it's so dark and concentrated that it dances on the )edge of bitterness, but in a style reminiscent of the finest Italian Merlots, that use that flavor to define and elucidate a dark and potent wine. In the mouth it fills out with luscious cherry and plum and blackberry fruit, baking chocolate, coconut and nougat. Yet it remains sleek and stylish, with a strong licorice note.
Spice, licorice and herbal notes complement red-fruit aromas, while the palate offers plenty of structure and tannic grab. There's an avalanche of blackberry, cassis, fig, chocolate and herbal flavors to process, while the finish is rich and rewarding before breaking up in bits.
With its big, hard tannins, this is one for the cellar. There's a certain austerity that suggests the rocky soils of this mountain vineyard. But the fruit, packed into a dense core, is ripe and suggestive of blackberry and cherries. The youthful brawniness softens after some time in the glass or decanter, but you're best off aging it until 2019 or so.
Fragrant spring blossoms are dusted with pollen on the nose of this delicate dry Riesling. It's intensely mineral, meshing dusty earth tones against crisp apple and lime flavors. Racy and lithe, it finishes briskly.
With its dark gold color and sweet, nutty aromas, this is on the rich side of the Madeira taste spectrum. It has attractive fruitiness and aged citrus acidity that go together, leaving a wine that is both sweet but also fresh.
Marked by a light, silky texture and notable acidity, this Pinot has a rich core of raspberry and persimmon fruit. It's a rich wine, elegant and complex, but it needs a little time for the elements to knit together. Hold until 2015.
Suave blueberry-chocolate notes meet with light and delicate violet florality on the nose of this single vineyard bottling from the Bay Area-based producer. The palate is lively and tart with underripe blackberries, sesame oil and a sizzling acidity.
Ottomino consistently has success with this single-vineyard Zinfandel. As always, it's dry, smoothly tannic and complex, with flavors of wild berry, tobacco, chocolate and spice.
Very ripe, almost candied notions of orange and mandarin peel determine the aromatic direction of this streamlined yet ripe Riesling. The flavors play along the entire ripe citrus spectrum: clementine and tangerine are there as well as pink grapefruit. The purity and subtlety, with hints of fragrant citrus leaves, make for a lasting impression and long finish.
This is a good, round, fruity style of Riesling. It's off-dry (2.6% residual sugar), with flavors of pineapple, sweet tangerine and Meyer lemon. The fruit is simply delicious; drink now.
Cotton candy and bubblegum aromas of cool fermentation and cultured yeasts are pleasant, and the bright pink color is striking. But the flavors are relatively modest, offering little more than crisp acid refreshment.
With its prominent new wood, here is a wine that goes for spice, caramel and high toast flavors. It has great power, a wine that is currently all structure, leaving the fruit to gain in richness at a later stage.
Hard around the edges, this wine does have some fruit, but this is masked by the bitter chocolate and burnt tannins. Juiciness surfaces in the aftertaste, but almost as an afterthought.
Neutral aromas include hints of sea foam and salty brine. This Brazilian brut feels standard and regular. Peachy flavors are mild and a touch grassy, while this feels waxy on the finish.
Plum and animal aromas are okay. A chunky, rubbery palate is full but lacking in shape and nuance. This tastes of peppery plum and berry in front of a limited finish with notes of hard spice and berry fruits.
Too hot and harsh by far. The blackberry and cherry fruit has a baked, stewed taste that finishes with searing, peppery heat. It's basically Port without the sweetness.
This is a fun, creamy and rich wine made from a white grape native to Piedmont, Italy. This has intriguing tastes of sweet, tart fresh-squeezed lemonade, with a nutty, apple-driven acidity that lingers through the finish. Barrel-fermented, it would pair nicely with scallops.
This muscular blend of Grenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre spends about a year in oak prior to bottling, yet the oak has integrated well, adding notes of clove and cinnamon. Cracked pepper, plums and black olives round out the flavor profile, and dusty tannins linger on the finish. Drink 2016–2025.
This is an easy, clean and direct Sauvy, with fresh notes of lime, tart gooseberry and green plum on the nose and mouth. The palate is lively and bright, finishing mouthwatering and refreshing. Drink now.
This sweet sparkling wine shows a steady, creamy texture with tangerine mousse, wild flower, honey, peach blossom and soapy foam. The long sweet finish would match well with baked apricot pie.
Two thirds Chardonnay, and one third a Viognier/Roussanne blend, this young wine has a definitely spritzy mouthfeel and a yeasty finish. The fruit flavors are fresh and lively, suggesting lemon and pineapple, with finishing hints of honeycomb.
The result of an accidental planting of these two varieties in the same block, this blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon and 30% Syrah provides prime evidence why these two grapes make for a dynamic duo. Aromas of roasted coffee, black-cherry paste, Dr Pepper, vanilla and elderberry prove both juicy and elegant. With a silky mouthfeel and polished acidity, the palate is layered with blueberry, blackcurrant, tobacco, leather and dark-chocolate flavors.
Quite gold for Fiano, with a thick apricot and peach syrup nose. Quite cushy, with ripe melon and peach flavors. Finishes short but round, with soft acids.
This is a ripe, generous wine that speaks of the sun and warmth of the Alentejo. It has rich black fruits, dark plums and berries, with spice and vanilla flavors. The acidity, with its final lift, gives the wine a fresh aftertaste.
Pear, almond and citrus aromas lead the way, followed by flavors of appleskin, pear and dried spices. Pretty, but it doesn't have a great deal of richness on the palate. Finishes fresh but short. Imported by T.G.I.C. Importers.
This spicy and forward wine offers firm blackberry and black cherry fruit accented with savory olive flavors. Its vanilla and baking spices notes suggest some time in new wood, and a hint of Dr. Pepper comes through on the finish. Syrah is definitely a strength at this winery.
Rich, sweet spicy aromas lead to a powerful, intense and dry wine that powers through the brisk acidity of this opulent wine. Has a fine structure and heady flavors of orange zest, yet still has some elegance.
Blackberry ice cream, vanilla and licorice meet with fudge and espresso on the immensely rich nose of this blend of 55% Petite Sirah, 26% Zinfandel and 19% Syrah. Blueberry and cassis dominate the palate, which is soft in texture and full of chocolate, cherry cordial and fig flavors.
A mere 174 cases of this wine were produced. It shares the essence of the '03 Monte Rosso Zin, reviewed below, but is richer and more concentrated, as well as much higher in alcohol, pushing 16%. Thoroughly dry, with flavors of coffee, dried blackberries, bitter chocolate and cloves, this is a complex, impressive wine.
An enormously elegant, complex Pinot Noir that changes endlessly in the glass and is a joy to drink. Completely dry, and marked by silky tannins, it shows complicated cherry, rhubarb, pomegranate, cola, orange tea and sandalwood flavors. First class. Best now and for the next four or five years.
This shows the subtlest hints of the apricot character so often found in Viognier. That gives richness to contrast its crisp acidity and apple and pear flavors. The finish is long and perfumed. Drink now.
All of the Brajkovitch family's 2010 Chardonnays are top-notch, so choices become more a question of preference than of absolute quality. The Hunting Hill is medium bodied and silky in texture, with hints of grilled pineapple and bold, assertive fruit flavors. It should drink well for at least four more years.
Shows the dryness, crisp acidity, flowers and minerality that often mark Carneros Chadonnays, which makes it elegant and sleek. With a touch of Meyer lemons and limes, it rises to richness.
Prickly aromas are ruled by pyrazines. This feels heavy and grabby, with a mouthfeel dictated by grape skins. Flat, salty white-fruit flavors finish wan, with a green note of bell pepper.
Cherry, cola and pomegranate flavors mark this dry, silky Pinot Noir. It's a little soft and simple.
With only 30 cases imported, this might be a tough find, but it's a great Terrasses du Larzac at an attractive price. Rich and concentrated dark fruit flavors of plum, cherry and boysenberry are infused with notes of chicory and herbal bark. The lush and creamy texture fills the palate, with a vanilla custard richness and a baking spice-flavored finish.
This Bordeaux blend is mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, with a splash of Cabernet Franc and Merlot. It's rich in flavors of chocolate, blackberry and currant essence and oak, wrapped into tannins that are soft and smooth but firm. Delicious now, but precocious, all flash and sizzle. Give it 5–6 years in the cellar to develop some bottle complexity.
Yates Conwill is next to the Resonance vineyard, which was just sold to Burgundy's Louis Jadot. This vineyard is really reaching its prime, showing lovely ripe flavors of raspberry, red plum and sweet cherry. Generous acidity keeps the wine in proportion and leads through a generous midpalate with highlights of black tea and dried herb. Drink now and over the next 10 years.
Creamy, herbal freshness shines in this wine, recalling yeast and sage, lemon zest and aloe vera. The palate is sprightly and fresh, delivering loads of lemon and lime flavor in its slender, easy frame. A slight spritz makes it even more refreshing.
With its scents of cherry preserves, spice and leather, this is a more approachable wine than proprietor Stephane Robert's 2005. The lower acidity gives it a sense of lushness, but it's also slightly less concentrated and intense. Drink now–2014.
Aromas like honeydew melon and flavors recalling sweet cucumber create a very fruity profile for this medium-bodied, lightly sweet wine.
This recently released 2002 is still showing its youth, with a firm, mineral edge to it. But it does have the right refreshingly crisp character, along with intense fruits, and acidity that just powers right through. Wait 3–4 years.
The kirsch, cranberry, dried herb, pomegranate and barrel spice aromas are laser focused, with smoked meat notes providing accents. The black fruit flavors are über concentrated and dense. It's wound tightly at first but when it opens up, it delivers.
Smooth as velvet, with a good balance of cherries, blackberries, violets and new, toasty oak, this is a luscious Merlot, dry and balanced. The alcohol is below 14%, so it's not one of those chocolaty confections. But it is an elegant, sophisticated table wine that drinks well now and will hold for a couple years.
Savory on the nose with modest apple and pear aromas accented by a curious smoked ham note, this smoky off-dry Riesling with a touch of honeycrisp apple sweetness has a briney, umami-laden complexity that would make it an interesting companion to prosciutto wrapped around morsels of melons and fig.
This opens with aromas of underbrush, tilled soil, grilled porcini, espresso and ripe black berry. The palate offers dried black cherry, roasted coffee bean and coconut alongside drying, astringent tannins and soft acidity. Drink through 2015.
A powerful wine, very structured with wood, coffee notes and dark tannins. It feels extracted, although the weight of fruit is certainly enough to handle that. It's for the long haul, a concentrated wine that needs at least 10 years.
Rich and complex from the start, the nose and palate of this wine feature a fruit melange of mango, melon, banana wrapped in nicely integrated oak. For some, the acid may be a touch high but this keeps the wine bright and crisp, and sustains this fairly full, barrel-fermented wine’s long finish.
Dark, dense and thoroughly modern with vibrant layers of boysenberry and black cherry fruit. Finely buffed tannins surround exotic spice and intense wild berry flavors on the palate that trail off into a long, vanilla-infused finish. Very impressive.
This wine is on the pale side for this vintage. There is a yeasty character that comes across as bitterness. By contrast, the acidity and the crisp fruits are fine, light and delicate. Drink now.
This earthy red starts with aromas of cedar, smoke and pepper, followed by flavors of red berries, smoke and minerals. A dry and peppery backbone fishes clean on the tongue. Spunky and fun.
This wine shows how aromatic and floral this varietal can be. It offers clove and rose petal along with raspberry in the aromas. The full body is supported by good acidity and moderate tannins.
Fresh, cutting gooseberry and grapefruit flavors persist from nose to finish in this exquisitely light bodied Riesling. The palate is off-dry in style, suggesting sweet-tart tangerine and apricot accented by shades of green herb and bramble. The finish is brisk but clean. Drink now through 2020.
A nice, dry Chard, a bit on the earthy, tobaccoey side, with pleasantly acidic mineral flavors and hints of lemons, limes and pineapples.
Soft toast and hazelnut aromas add character to the otherwise straightforward honeydew, pear and orange oil flavors of this value Chard. Medium weight with a round body but lifting acidity to keep things fresh and vibrant. Drink now.
This lightweight red is on the herbal side, although with attractive bitter-cherry flavors and some fresh acidity.
Fresh blueberry and plum play on nose and palate. Lively freshness permeates the glass, accentuating the wine's tart, precise fruitiness. It's medium bodied with moderate grip, lots of verve and a nervy, fresh and totally appetizing finish.
I like this wine, though it is a little odd. The wine's cherry fruit also takes on an interesting orange character, through and through, plus accents of lavender. Closes taut, with sour cherries and citrus. Give it a go. 300 cases produced. Imported by Old Bridge Cellars.
Tight, tart raspberry fruit is immediately juicy and inviting, set atop a crisp and refreshing mineral base. The concentration is impressive, and this seems likely to age well over the next decade. Drink now through 2025.
Zarate is known for its late-release, leesy Albariños balanced by shearing acidity. El Palomar is cut from that cloth; it shows baked apple, oak and warmth on the nose, while the palate is razor sharp, with clean-cutting acidity. Flavors of vanilla and toast mix with spice and citrus, while the finish is long and woody, but not resiny or thick. Drink  through 2015.
The nose on this easygoing Riesling is a bit reserved, suggesting hints of stone and bramble. It's quite vibrant on the palate though, offering loads of sweet-tart apple and pear flavors bolstered by zesty tangerine acidity. The finish wraps up brisk and clean.
Perfectly fits the prototypical Barossa style of Cabernet, displaying ripe cassis and chocolate notes framed by ample oak. It's mouthfilling and round, with no hard edges and a long, mint-tinged finish.
Made from a field blend of old vines, this is an impressive wine. Oak aging still shows in the toasty character, although the weight and strength of the fruit and spice flavors are coming through well. It's complex, dark and with great richness and potential. The wine comes from the Foz Vineyard at the mouth of the Pinhão river in the heart of the Douro. Drink from 2018.
A bit too vegetal, balancing asparagus notes with just enough grapefruit flavors to keep a modicum of balance. Tart on the finish.
If you like big Malbecs, this blend of grapes from three elevations is up your alley. Graphite, blackberry, mocha and vanilla aromas are inviting, while the rich, sappy palate houses coffee, cooked berry and coconut flavors. It's oaky, ripe, heavy and full of power. Drink now–2016.
Very heady and earthy aromas of cedar, tobacco leaf, smoked cigar and the hint of ancho chile show on the nose this unique, cool-climate take on Merlot. The palate is quite woodsy with cedar and pine but also jammy with red fruit, bolstered by bitter dark chocolate and dried chile pepper.
Melon, grass, tarragon and other patented SB aromas open the show. The palate is crisp and well cut, with flavors of white citrus, nectarine and lime. Light on the finish, with mild but lasting green notes.
This dry, remarkably minerally Riesling highlights tones of granite and wet slate against a backdrop of fresh apple, lemon and tangerine. It's broad and textural on the palate, with sharp lime juice acidity and a hint of lemon pith and herb on the finish.
Aromas of blue flowers, dried aromatic herbs and dark-skinned berry lead the nose. The juicy palate offers fleshy black cherry, raspberry, white pepper and roasted coffee bean alongside assertive, dusty tannins. A green note of powdered sage leaves an astringent finish.
This is a wine with simple fruit-juice flavors. It's ripe, but has attractive acidity. Overall, it's very fruity and ready to drink.
Dry Creek Chards ask for a certain indulgence. They're never opulent or over the top, and have rather earthy flavors that bring to mind sweet, cured tobacco. This wine, which is a fine example, features winemaker interventions, like lees and oak, and finishes with some tannins. If you're adventurous, try aging it.
Polished and fruity, with ripe peach custard, nectarine, pear and spicy green apple flavors enriched with the vanilla and buttered toast of oak barrels. Crisp acidity makes the wine racy.
This Carignan-based blend with 25% Grenache is dense and concentrated, highlighting just how well the old Carignan vines from the region can express themselves. Ripe blueberry and boysenberry flavors are matched with medium-intense notes of bay, menthol, sweet bark and bittersweet chocolate. The silky mouth offers a round but balanced feel, with a nice mineral lift to the close.
This Moscato d'Asti is fragrant and fresh but not over the top. In fact, it offers elegant aromas of white flower, peach blossom and stone fruit. Try it with semifreddo cream and raspberry sauce.
Bright and juicy, this fruity wine has plenty of cherry acidity and bright acidity. It's attractive to drink now with its broad texture and crisp aftertaste.
This is a rich, smooth and ripe wine. It has plenty of lemon acidity that contrasts with the mineral texture and the melon and pear fruit flavors. The wine is full, refreshing and also likely to age for a few more months. Best to drink this wine from 2017.
Softly tannic and direct in jammy blackberry, cherry and red plum flavors, with chocolate overtones that have a candied, sugary edge. Not showing a great deal of complexity now, but could evolve in a few years. Hard to predict.
Strawberry and red currant complement deeper, more savory aspects of cedar and gun smoke in this thick, full-bodied and concentrated reserve-level wine, accented in bitter, black tea.
This moderately pale wine doesn't show a lot of concentration or tannic structure, but it offers charming notes of cherry, clove and cinnamon. Drink now.
Balanced, a wine that has both great fruit and sweet apple acidity. Hints of spice from wood, followed by good freshness, giving a wine that is rich and crisp.
Fresh and fruity, with a young, vibrant quality, this wine offers plenty of mixed berry and purple fruit flavors with just the lightest touch of oak. Perfect for a picnic. Imported by Victoire Imports.
Oxidized almost to the point of being tawny in the glass, this soft and buttery wine has virtually no fruit left, and finishes with a bitter edge.
Olive, roast plum and heavy berry aromas lead toward modest boysenberry flavors that show some weediness. The finish is tannic and hard, with a touch of red fruit as well as a burnt characteristic.
An aromatically vibrant wine with notes of slate, peach, apricot and citrus. It drinks off dry, with exquisitely balanced acidity and a lot of depth and richness to the fruit flavors. Impressive stuff.
This is a well-built and elegant Cabernet Sauvignon (with 5% Sangiovese) with thick layers of cherry, forest bramble, caramel, molasses and smoky tobacco-like tones that are deep and penetrating. It scores high in terms of intensity, complexity and ends with fresh, menthol nuances on the finish.
Friendly, crisp, fresh Conference pear flavors pervade nose and palate for a hit of crisp, green, refreshing fruitiness. The palate is smooth and balanced, light but fluid, mellow but fresh. The pear fruit lingers beautifully, rather languid for such a fresh wine.
A flamboyant Chard, packed with tropical fruit flavors and with a lavish overlay of smoky oak. Drinks crisp and clean in the mouth, with a creamy texture and a long, spicy finish. Could use a bit more finesse and subtlety, but glamorous and enticing.
A yeasty baked bread note leads this wine's nose before smoky oak and lushly layered blue and black fruit take over. With spice- and leather-laced flavors, it offers a wealth of brawny structure and lip-smacking succulence, finishing soft.
Along with weight and richness, this wine also has a lively fresh, red fruit character. Caramel and ripe berries are shot through with acidity to give a warm, yet bright wine.
A fragrant apple-skin aroma sets the scene for this wine that is warm and ripe. A touch of nutmeg adds an extra dimension to its yellow fruits. It's rich while still remaining true to its minerally, terroir-based origins. Age for two years.
This mature PN from a hot vintage isn't showing much life. Earthy, raisiny aromas aren't fresh, while wood tannin and acid are keeping it afloat. Flavors of brown sugar and decayed berry fruits finish stale. This is on its very last legs.
Light strawberry aromas lead the way, with a touch of almond candy as background. The palate is fruity but nondescript, with tangy acidity and good mouthfeel. This is a perfectly competent rosé, especially for Argentina, which isn't really known for the style.
Lots of fresh, fruity flavors of raspberries and cherries in this straightforward, dry wine. While it's pretty simple, it has good acidity and is a good example of Pinot Noir for this price.
This focused effort features fresh-cut apple and pear flavors that are spicy and tightly wrapped with a Bourbon-barrel-like accent. Delicious now, but it can be cellared for a decade at least.
Simple and soft, this dry red blend has sweet-and-sour flavors of cherries and tobacco.
This wine shows Viura at its most elegant and expressive. It has weight, balance and body along with tangy lemon drop flavors. If you like pure but weighty citrus with a touch of mineral and brine, this has it. Better than most Viura by leaps and bounds.
There is perfumed fruit, with aromas of red currants. This wine, named after the granite soil which forms the base of Saint-Joseph, is earthy, ripe and firmly tannic, but with plenty of red fruit flavors. It should develop quickly, over the next 2-3 years.
The 2003 vintage wasn't an easy one in Barossa, and Lehmann's Stonewell bottling is one of its weaker efforts in recent years. That said, it's still an attractive, open-knit Shiraz with plenty of berry and chocolate flavors and some slightly drying tannins on the finish. Drink now–2012. To be released February 2008.
A lively, fresh wine that gives a steely, mineral edge to the ripe fruits and the crisp acidity. The wine fills the mouth, a bold streak of apple skin structure boosting the fresh fruits.
Concentrated cranberry and red currant aromas meet granite and dried herbs on the nose of this 100% Cabernet Franc. A round body of racy currant and blackberry meet a solid core of graphite, while finely-grained tannins give support. This is a well-balanced showing from winemaker Ben Parsons.
Forward and fruity yet balanced and composed, this bold red blend is made from a kitchen's sink blend of Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Syrah. Luscious black-cherry and plum flavors are ripe but keep a shade short of jammy and are highlighted by a bright vein of acidity. Bold, dense tannins on the finish should meld nicely by 2020.

A dark color and rich, jammy, baked aromas of charred oak and lush berries are the opening to this blend of 72% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Carmenère and 8% Cabernet Franc. Moderately bold acidity and firm tannins lend energy and structure to the palate, while this tastes of blackberry, cassis and spicy oak. A slightly hot finish with a lot of wood spice is the closing act. Drink through 2021.
The combination of leafiness and pink grapefruit on the nose suggests red currants, while the flavors on the palate are more tropical in nature. Still, crisp citrus carries the day, giving vibrancy to this medium-bodied wine.
The nose is still closed, there is an almost smoky aspect and a promise of far more perfume in the future. The palate comes with great concentration of still tightly coiled lemon zest notes but the aftertaste is almost salty. This is dry, linear, muscular and toned, affording glimpses of future grandeur through dense lemon and lime zestiness. Give this some time in bottle. Drink 2018–2030.
This is 100% Roussanne from Red Mountain, whose heat gives the grape plenty of ripening. Here it reaches into high-toned, tropical and candied citrus fruits, accented with pungent aromas of spun sugar, fruit candy and a whiff of diesel. Complex, forward, juicy and just a little hot in the finish.
Velvety-smooth and rich in red plum and strawberry, this medium-bodied, varietally honest wine is textured and complex. It's well-crafted and balanced, with a lingering finish.
A very pretty middle-aged wine that has at least another decade in it. At this point in time, the nose is still showing a lot of black-fruit aromas, while the palate is chewy, meaty and rich as it spreads out with ripe flavors mixed with touches of mushroom, truffle and vanilla. A fine Gran Reserva with equal bits of tradition and modernity showing through.
Freshly peeled green pear with top notes of fig leaf and aloe vera dominate nose and palate. This is slender but buffered, creamy but not fat. A balanced wine with friendly glints of fruit and freshness.
Alta Maria's appellation bottling is a bit leaner than the winery's single-vineyard bottlings, but quite elegant, with flint, pink grapefruit, mango and spearmint flavors, enhanced by a touch of oak.

Aromas of vanilla and baking spice are followed by ample red fruit and spice flavors. The acids are tart, giving the wine a zing.
Jammy raspberry aromas lack focus; the bouquet is also jammy and lacking in structure and tannins. Flavors of raspberry Kool-Aid are devoid of oak and spice contributions, while the finish more like juice than wine.
With its extra-dark rosé color, Clairet is an unusual style. This wine is juicy with some acidity alongside fresh raspberry fruits. At the end, the wine seems heavy.
Though just five years old, this wine seems advanced, with notes of pencil box, leather, dried orange peel, mesquite and brown spices. There's still plenty of juicy acid to be had that provides interest with some grit to the tannins.
This wine from the top of the Santa Cruz Mountains has a distinctively intriguing nose, with sweet chive, yellow onion, lemon shaved ice, wet cement and pink grapefruit blossom aromas. Iodine and a quinine character greets the palate, with slight hints of balanced almond, lime pith and citrus-blossom flavors.
Bright and balanced with earthy notes of straw and almond skin spicing up the green melon, anjou pear and rich kiwi fruit flavors. The mouth is full and satifying while the finish is somewhat brisk with great lift. Drink now.
Much more spicy and nuanced than most cavas, whether we're talking rosado or not. This one begins with aromas of black gumdrops and orange drink. The palate echoes the nose as it displays star anise and Sambuca flavors along with distant citrus. A different breed that's both odd and intriguing.
Sauvignon Blanc adds steel, Sémillon adds cream, and Assyrtico, body to this solid white. Flavors of peach, lime and peanut follow a similar bouquet, and the wine has a steely finish of peach pit. A great accompaniment to grilled fish.
This Sangiovese from central Italy offers a very fresh and vibrant quality of fruit that is expressed as cherry, blackberry and sour plum. It's a simple, one-dimensional wine and its best attribute is precisely that.
This is unapologetically warm-climate Chardonnay, featuring tropical fruit, plenty of weight and texture and a whack of vanilla and cut-wood character. It's a broad, full-bodied wine that pulls together on the finish, ending with notes of pineapple and citrus.
A good wine in a difficult year, this estate-grown Cabernet does not lean heavily on new oak, nor does it need to. Blackberry, cassis and earth form the solid core, and there are substantial, natural-tasting acids providing support. The neutral barrels were half American and half French, but it's the fruit and vineyard that are most on display.
Wild berry aromas come with notes of Band-Aid and latex. This feels tight and pinched, with hard tannins. A flavor profile built on limited berry and peppery bitterness ends with some clipped tannins.
This Bobal's dark, earthy berry and leather aromas are closed but presentable. On the palate, herbal plum, tomato and lightly baked berry flavors finish with the scrub of rustic tannins.
Wild flowers, stone fruit and citrus mark the nose of this very characteristic Prosecco bubbly. Pretty mineral notes fill in the background and the wine manages to be drying in the mouth and slightly sweet at the same time. This sparkler shows a deft hand when it comes to elegance and balance.

From Duckhorn's second label, this Bordeaux blend is based on Cabernet and Merlot. At less than half the price of Duckhorn's main Cabs and Merlots, it's a very good buy, showing richness, balance and complexity. The blackberry and cherry fruit has been tastefully enhanced with smoky oak. A great food wine.
Coming from 100-year-old vines, this fascinating wine shows black cherry, spearmint, graphite and pencil lead on the restrained nose. The palate is all about dried cherries and the tart skins of plum and other red-purple fruits, keeping a nice sour tension throughout the sip.

Here's a gorgeous Brunello that achieves that ever-so delicate balance of fruit versus menthol notes versus toast to render an unforgettable drinking experience. This is why they say Brunello can't be made in any other part of the world outside this tiny corner of Tuscany: Intense notes of chewy cherry, carob, licorice, almonds, chopped herbs ride over dusty tannins and a long finish.
The Síria grape—a relative of Malvasia and Roupeiro—is only found under this name in the mountainous eastern Beira region. This rendition is aromatic, with a tight, cool texture, tangy acidity and lime zest and apple flavors that give a crisp, fruity aftertaste.
The second wine of Château de Belcier, this is still young, showing dense and dusty tannins over dark wood aging. It is dry, stalky with black currant acidity and a tight, firm aftertaste.

Iris, violet, steeped cherry, camphor and underbrush aromas come together in the glass. The chewy, succulent palate offers red cherry, raspberry, aromatic herb and star anise while firm but refined tannins provide backbone and a velvety mouthfeel. It boasts balance, freshness and body. Drink 2018 through 2025.
Lean, tight and austere, this textbook Eden Valley Riesling should develop well over the next 5–8 years, reaching maturity around 2022. Scents of petrichor and tangerine ease into tart lemon-lime notes on the palate, ending tart and mouthpuckering.
Coconut, vanilla and spice aromas are at the fore, with the fruit seeming a bit dried out. The black-plum flavors show pleasing depth, with baking-spice flavors speckled throughout. The wood is primary but it's still appealing.
This is a densely structured young Cab. Although the tannins are  ripe and sweet, they still possess enough astringency to suggest cellaring.

Unfined and unfiltered, it will be best after 2008 and through 2017.
A little baked, warm and medicinal, but also an interesting and unique tasting wine. There's a beefy, gummy weight to the palate, but also flavors of blackberry, herbs, soy sauce and brown sugar. Shows good points but rates out as a strange wine that confounds as much as it inspires.
Whiffs of petrol add complexity to lush honeycrisp apple and stone fruit notes on the nose and palate of this off-dry Riesling. Sleek and steely on the midpalate with an edgy lime juice acidity, and the finish is quite dry.

The palate is deep and layered, and full bodied, with blackberry, chocolate and coffee flavors. A long, spicy, toasty finish is warming but not hot. Drink through 2017.
The second wine of the Kressmann family's Latour-Martillac, produced from young vines, has some of the same firm structure and ripe black-currant fruit. Everything is just that bit more mature, giving a ripe fruit-packed wine with a balanced core of tannins. Drink from 2019.

Crystal-clear aromas of green apples and minerals come with a slight dash of oak. This is barrel-fermented Viura (with 10% Malvasia), but there's nothing woody or overtly barrel-dominated about the wine, which is tight and citric on the tongue, with tangerine, green apple and nectarine flavors that finish racy and tart.
Fruity, dusty and earthy aromas are gentle, clean and inviting. But the wine turns syrupy and saccharine-sweet, and soft and flabby to boot. You wonder what you could possibly pair this with at the table. A Rhône-style blend of Grenache, Mourvèdre, Syrah and Cinsault. —S.H.
This wine opens with toasted nut, dried herb and citrus zest aromas. On the linear, lean palate, thyme and mineral notes back up yellow apple flavors, with lively acidity. It closes on a bitter almond note.

A good, sound Cabernet offering lots of flavor, even though there's not a whole lot of complexity. Shows easy, upfront cherries, blackberries, red currants, licorice and herbs, wrapped into finely ground tannins. Ready now.
With no discernable wood, this is all about tight, perfumed fruits. A stalky character comes from the light body and smoky character. At the end, the black fruits and acidity come into play. Drink now.

This wine is a blend created using grapes sourced from vineyard sites, giving it a ripe, full-bodied character. It is smooth, almost New-World in style, but with an edge of tannins and acidity. Drink this wine now.
Impressive in every way. The color shines an irridescent ruby, while the bouquet is massive, an amalgamation of fresh-cut cedar, pencil lead and lush berry fruit.

Does not require cellaring but should hold for up to 10 years.

Round and ripe tropical fruit mark this solid and affordable Chardonnay. Interesting shadings of lime, clove and other spices keep it engaging on the palate. Ends with a medium- length finish of sweet-tart pineapple fruit.
Toasty aromas fold in baked apple notes. Sharp, sizzling and high in acid, the palate is citric and tough to navigate. Flavors of orange, lemon and sour apple are no shock given the palate.
The chalky soil conveys a cool feeling to this wine. Tight and mineral, it has yellow fruits that show good acidity. Toasty wood gives a juicy aftertaste. It's already delicious, but the wine's cool character will develop further, so drink from 2016.
A difficult wine made problematic by the vintage. The cherry fruit tastes overtly sweet, and I suspect there's some residual sugar, the tradeoff for keeping alcohol moderate. Most unfortunate, because everything else works.
Definitely comes down on the gamy side, with an aroma of bacon or sweaty saddle wafting over black raspberry fruit. Oak adds vanilla and charred-smoky elements. In the mouth it's fruity, soft and a little simple. A mere 120 cases produced.
All the work that the winery did for so many years with Pinot Noir is brought home with this delicate, elegant wine.

A gritty Pinot, with jammy raspberry and cherry flavors, and an awkward overlay of sweet, caramelized oak.

This Super-Tuscan blend of Howell Mountain Sangiovese and Stag's Leap Cabernet Sauvignon and Cab Franc is one dark wine. It smells big, too, like an egg cream, which New Yorkers will understand. This chocolatey wine has hints of malt, while the flavors are vast, suggesting ripe blackberries. It's a huge wine in extract and mouthfeel. This creates awkward food-pairing challenges. Barbecued ribs come to mind -- but at $45?

Young, bright and easy, this offers pretty aromas of forest fruit and white cherry. The finish is characterized by a bitter almond note.

Acidic, chalky and sharp upon entry, this wine's light berry flavors quickly give way to those tart acids. Though the fruit shows some concentration, it's a one-dimensional effort that has not completely knit together.
An equivalent two-thirds Cab, one-third Syrah blend to the Ovide, this time using En Chamberlin fruit. The wines are strikingly different, equally powerful, but the Roma is perhaps more straightforward with its jammy, full-on cherry/berry fruit parade. Citrus rind lifts the finish, leading into nicely sculpted tannins.
The oaky smoke is quite powerful on the nose, which also shows vanilla dust and lime juice. The palate is anything but austere, full of toast, caramelized apples and smoked fruits. A line of citrus acidity stops it from becoming flabby, but this is definitely for the oak lovers crowd.

Better than last year's bottling, this is a very dry, stylish wine of complexity. A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, it's leaner than many North Coast clarets, with an herbal edge to the cherry flavors. That restraint makes it a comfortable companion to a wide range of food.
Purple in color, with potent berry aromas. The blend is 65% in favor of Malbec, and the wine boasts black raspberry and plum flavors. Finishes hefty and warm, with notes of cola.
This is a perfumed crisp wine, attractively fruity and with delicious acidity. Its fruit is effusive and needs to calm down and fill out, so just wait until 2018 for it richness to be fully apparent.

Lemon and grapefruit aromas come with minerally notes of granite and crushed vitamin dust. An almost sharp and cutting palate offers generic citrus and green apple flavors in front of a chiseled, high-acid finish.

Young and tight, this Zin shows the rustic, brawny nature of Zin's personality, with rugged tannins, peppery spices and a sweet-and-sour taste to the wild cherry, raspberry, pomegranate and rhubarb fruit. Will ride out the years, gradually softening and sweetening.

Now owned by Château Labégorce-Margaux, this classed growth is beginning to come back to life. With this vintage, perhaps the wood flavor is too much, but the fruit has weight, dark spicy character and solid tannins. Age for 5–6 years for the wood to soften.
Penetrating flavors of preserved peach and honey are nuanced by layers of saffron, pollen and high-toned acidity in this sun-kissed auslese.

A totally correct but well-priced Cab that brings pretty much everything the textbook calls for. The nose features graphite, berry and smoky wood, while the mouthfeel is spot-on and made better by ripe, toasty berry, chocolate and spice flavors. A definite winner at its price point.
this medium-bodied Sauvignon Blanc shows only a bit of grassiness. Rather than green, it offers predominantly pineapple, grapefruit and even a touch of stone fruit, finishing with a citrusy flourish.
Nothing shy here; this 100% Primitivo, from the Stonetree vineyard, lists the alcohol at 15.5%. Dark and musky, lightly earthy and soft, it's a luscious bottle which blankets the tongue with rustic (in a good way) black fruits and exotic spices. For the finishing kicker, barrel aging brings in dark chocolate. Rare and wonderful.
Smoky, brambly notes persist from nose to finish on this dry, intensely savory Pinot Gris. Fresh lemon and apple flavors on the palate are concentrated, but finish on a green, vegetal tone.

Jammy aromas of candied red fruits and raisin lead into the palate, with red-fruit flavors and a sticky, bitter finish.
Aromas of roasted almond and pecan meet dried fig and date tones. The caramel-toffee laden palate brings an additional hint of brown-sugar-dusted walnut. While the acids are slightly sharp and the alcohol a bit abrasive, the sweet tones eventually balance things out, making it an easy sipper.
A large, complex, forceful wine that requires time to show off. What starts out murky, heavy and clumsy becomes more lovable once it gets some air. Along the way come plum, chocolate and raisin characteristics, and as expected, hammer-time tannins. Very hard on the cheeks, but such is Taurasi.
Earthy plum and berry aromas bring a floral note. This feels firm, rubbery and tight, with raw tannins and bright acidity. Earthy, rubbery blackberry flavors offer hints of chocolate and fig, while the finish is leathery and a touch salty.

Prinsi's Gaia Principe cru is located very near the Gallina vineyard and shows slightly softer and less intense aromas.

There's also a mineral note of chalk or wet stone that lingers long on the finish.
Quinta Nova is downriver of Pinhão, still in the heart of Douro vineyards. The wine is sold, firm, with a fine balance of dark tannins and concentrated fruit. It should be aged for 3–4 years.
A bright cherry and banana flavored wine, this is fresh and fruity. It has a light structure that helps to keep it all together along with the acidity for final crispness. Drink now.

Firm and supported with mineral-soaked acids, this has the texture, tannins and push-through to age gracefully, though it's perfectly ready right now.
Produced in the lightest of the Alsace wine styles, this is crisp, with refreshing acidity, citrus and green plum flavors and a bright finish. Great as an apéritif.
This wine is big in every dimension, from an unusually deep gold color, to a smoky, oaky, toasted-baguette aroma to almost sweet flavors like poached pear that are backed by more buttery, smoky nuances and surprisingly good acidity. While it makes a big first impression, further sips bring out even more complexity, layers and length.
A watery wine that tastes like a fruit juice blend of oranges, mangoes and pineapples, with a squirt of alcohol.
Deep purple in color, with grapy aromas of blackberry mixed with Graham cracker, this feels big, fat and syrupy. Black plum and blackberry flavors finish thick and jammy. Hailing from a hot year, this lacks definition but piles it on with ripe black-fruit flavors and weight.
Lean and earthy, marked by tobacco, dill and less than ripe cherry flavors. Tannins are tough and gritty. The wine finishes very dry and rasping, showing little fruit. The winemaker seems to have understood the problem here, and added five percent Syrah.
Marginally riper and plusher than Rusack's other two Pinots, but not by a lot. This is still a lean, earthy wine, short on flavor and long on acidity and tannins. Sift through the herbal, bay leaf and sage tastes and you'll find a note of cherry. Aging may help.
This is a superb value white that's versatile and perfect for company. Fresh white florals, Asian pear and a touch of pineapple acidity dominate, with softly prickling acidity dancing on your tongue through the close. Light weight but mouthwatering and easy to drink.
Pretty floral and white grapefruit notes on the palate scream Gewürz, but fresh apple flavors layered in smoke and a chalky, crushed stone minerality make this unusual New Mexico bottling an interesting treat.
Frothy, fresh, lemony and light—this uncomplicated, slightly earthy crémant is ideal apéritif material with its easy-drinking, light-footed character. There's a lemony lift on the finish that's rather moreish.
This wine shows a lot of reduction that provides off-putting aromas. The strawberry and cranberry flavors are full and show pleasing purity and length. The disconnect between the aromas and flavors is substantial but some time in a decanter might sync them up.
Black cherry flavor stars in this full-bodied, brawny and expressive red that's thick with jammy fruit and interwoven tannins and oak.
Tight and compact with pristine aromas of peach, citrus and sourdough, this vibrant sparkling Brut would pair with shellfish and oysters. There are linear mineral notes at the back but the wine is fresh and tart in the mouth.
Pretty red fruit leads the nose on this blend of 50% Grenache, 35% Syrah and 15% Mourvèdre, along with brown spices, anise and chopped herbs. The forest flavors are strong, with pine sap and eucalyptus, as riper boysenberry fruit emerges with chopped oregano and thyme.
A solidly made Shiraz from power-producer Neil Ellis. Wild strawberries, white pepper and game notes appear on the nose, while red plum and sweet spice fill out the palate. Balanced acidity and dusty tannins with a satiny texture make this an easy-to-enjoy, ready-to-drink wine. Try pairing with loin lamb chops or wild boar stew.
“Zéro Dosage” means just that; the resulting wine is very dry. It has great crisp, piercing grapefruit freshness, with hints of nuttiness and a lively final acidity. Some bottle age should help tame it.
Tropical in personality, this wine is also singing in acidity, offering refreshing stone-like minerality to complement the fruit. Layered and just the slightest bit grassy, it's a wonderfully refreshing quaff, and a fantastic choice with seafood.
Aromas of green melon and pear are calm like a lake with no breeze. This feels mildly creamy, while leesy briny melon and peach flavors turn somewhat bitter prior to a soft easy finish that doesn't sing but doesn't fall off.
This vintage of Antinori's Pian delle Vigne offers surprisingly mature and jammy notes of strawberry or blackberry marmalade followed by a soft, rich mouthfeel. This expression shows less elegance and finesse than past interpretations.
This is classic Beringer Private Reserve Chard, ripe, oaky, lush, balanced and utterly delicious. There's a lot of everything, from massive tropical and citrus fruits to creamy lees. The malolactic fermentation helps make it buttery and 80% new French oak brings buttered toast and vanilla-bean richness. Balance comes by way of acidity and minerality.
From the Bendigo subregion, which has seen enormous expansion over the past several years, this is minor step up from Quartz Reef's regular bottling, with similar floral qualities on the nose and bright cherry fruit, but also more substantial tannins. Cellar for 2–3 years.
91-93 Barrel sample. On the dry side, this is powerful textured, a firm ripe wine that has big botrytis flavors, a very dry core. Obviously a wine for aging.
From the region renowned for producing regal whites, this Chardonnay impresses. A nose balancing poised fruit and crisp minerality unfolds into classic Chardonnay flavors of toasted oak, spice and creamy fruit. The texture is mouthfilling but not overly buttery. A very good choice for an elegant table.
This dense, tannic, 100% Cab needs time to come around. It's a masculine wine, with a muscular core of blackberry, plum and cherry fruit, and finishes dry. Should begin to open by 2009, and could really blossom for some years afterward.
Ripe and heavy on the nose, with hints of stewed plum, berries and chocolate. More chunky prune and plum follows in the mouth. Entirely drinkable but not refined.
Very slight notes of reduction still cling to the wine, but a swirl or two reveals crisp, crunchy red cherry. On the slender palate the fruit is pleasantly tart and even more crunchy but wonderfully vibrant. A refreshing, easy-drinking red. Drink soon.
Very rich, with freshly crushed pineapple, grilled ripe peach, buttered toast and caramelized vanilla cream flavors. Could have greater structure, as it's a little soft for all that weight, but it's a fancy Chardonnay.
Pinot Grigio has yet to find a distinguishing style in Washington State. This is borderline generic, almost beery, a plain, pleasant, fairly neutral white wine with a mix of white peaches and green apples.
So sweet and jammy, it's hard not to drink it up now, despite some firm tannins. Displays a rich spectrum of cherries, pomegranates and red currants, with exotic spices and the brown sugary sweetness of toasted oak. The finish is dry and elegant. A real beauty for drinking over the next five years.
Bordeaux blends show promise in this region. This combination of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 37.5% Merlot and 12.5% Cabernet Franc reveals rustic, leathery aromas of crushed Italian herbs, dried red cherries and fresh dill. Once sipped, flavors of fresh-ground coffee, oregano and bay leaf spice a base of cranberry fruit.
Thick and concentrated stuff, with aromas of sweet plums and cough syrup. The body is beefy and round, with full but simple plum and blackberry flavors. With color, size and heft, it has much of what Malbec is known for. Problem is, it needs better tuning and precision to rank higher.
Pretty ordinary stuff, although it does communicate Pinot's basic message of dryness and silkiness. Shows modest cherry and spice flavors.
Not cheap by Prosecco standards, and that extra level of quality is evident at every checkpoint. The bouquet is exceedingly snappy, with pure lemon-lime aromas. Citrus, green apple and white pepper flavors create a near-perfect palate, while the mouthfeel is excellent. About as good as Prosecco gets.
A good buy, compared to Roessler's more expensive bottlings. It's a county-wide blend, and quite a nice one. Crisp, dry and silky, it shows classic varietal flavors of cherries, cola, pomegranates and spices, accented with smoky sandalwood. Drink now.
Initially, this seems soft and superripe. But the acidity that shows through balances the black cherry jam flavors, and the touch of mint gives a delicious edge. The aftertaste brings back juicy, ripe fruit.
Aged in a mix of French and American oak barrels, this is dominated by their effusively toasty aromatics. But after the oak rush, the fruit seems a little light, just barely ripe enough to be present; the flavors run more to the herbal side of Syrah.
Loads of pineapple jam and roasted peach flavors in this rich, oaky Chardonnay. Nothing shy about its fruity power, with rich vanilla and caramel oak barrel influences. Could use greater complexity and nuance.
Lovely scents suggest citrus rind, lemon cake, honeycomb, candied orange and more. Substantial fruit flavors run from lime on through ripe pineapple, and the supporting structure offers a firm foundation of acid and extract, with a pleasingly long finish.
Soft and spicy, this high alcohol Syrah has flavors of baked or stewed blackberries and cherries, like the filling from a pastry tart. It's pleasantly dry, with an anise, red licorice finish.
Unripe, with green peppercorn, tobacco and dried sage flavors, showing only a slender note of blackberries. Good and dry, but lacks richness. Drink now.
Pressed violet, underbrush, overripe black-skinned fruit and a hint of scorched earth come together on this. The warm, forward palate has a rather rustic charm, delivering mature plum, crushed black cherry, baking spice, leather and a bitter, earthy note accompanied by round, evolved tannins.
In many ways, this is Valdemar's best wine in that it's always consistent and satisfying. The nose on this vintage offers a blast of sweet coconut and then black fruit aromas, and while there's acidity front and center it doesn't come across sharp. Instead, the focus is on plum and raspberry fruit and a finish that picks up steam.
This is a big, rich rosé, and a very delicious one. With fairly high alcohol, it's full-bodied, with complex flavors of orange peel, peach, watermelon, vanilla and spices. Perfect with paella or anything with ham.
This ripe Morellino di Scansano offers deep tones of toasted almond, spice and popcorn. There is juicy fruit in there, too, like cherry and blueberry, and the wine benefits from dense tannins and a chewy finish.
This 100% varietal wine comes from Gunselman Bench, McKinley Springs and Phinny Hill vineyards. Aromas of baking spice, vanilla, nougat and cherry are followed by fruit flavors that are surprisingly elegant in style considering the warmth of the vintage.
Looks as golden pale as a classic brut, but the full-bodied, ripe flavors of cherries and cassis-infused cream give it away as Cabernet Sauvignon. It's an unusual bubbly, but delicious, and fruity-rich enough to wash down everything from steak to chocolate cake.
Done in what can deservedly be called a European style, this low-alcohol, delicate wine offers varietally correct scents and flavors, with a lightly woodsy character.
William Church has outdone itself with this new Viognier, a mix of fruit from Conner Lee and Gamache Vineyards. A leesy, yeasty, textural underpinning complements the tangy lemon, lime, grapefruit and tangerine flavors. It's superfresh and delicious.
Aromas of canteloupe and spice set the scene for a powerful expression of Gewürztraminer. Everything is here—the rose petals and spice, the lychee and star fruit flavors, the sense of the exotic, and finishing with some distinct acidity, a product of the cooler 2004 growing season.
Baked berry, savory bacon and coconut aromas give this Cab a modern, sweet outlook. In the mouth, it's more raw and abrasive, with firm tannins and lemony acids. Flavors of baked berry fruits and resiny oak finish chewy and tannic, with a touch of heat.
Dark-colored and deeply flavored, this full-bodied wine smells smoky and meaty, tastes savory, feels firm and appropriately tannic. Showing the more robust, hearty side of Pinot, it can be paired successfully with most opulent meat and fowl dishes.
This wine shows itself in the glass as bold, ripe and finely structured. It is concentrated, with the young tannins of Baga and the juicy perfumes of Touriga Nacional that yield a wine that has several years to develop. Firm at the end, it will be an impressive wine as it ages. Drink from 2018.
Very oaky, very buttery, very posh in texture, this wine takes the spicy richness of oak-barrel fermentation and aging to a high level. It's not at all shy about the toast, caramel and baking-spice flavors, with a mouthcoating texture that helps those accents linger on the finish.
Veteran winemaker Nick Goldschmidt has crafted a simple, appealing Marlborough Pinot Noir featuring bright cranberry and pie-cherry fruit, some slightly mossy or herbal elements, medium body and supple tannins. Drink now.
This is a finely made mix of Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier grapes, light golden in color and dripping in marzipan, hazelnuts and baked bread. Complex and layered, it's got a depth of soul around zesty acidity, staying fleshy and full on the tongue.
Lots of crisp, citrusy acidity in this wine, which brightens the pineapple, orange, lemon and lime flavors. Meanwhile, 100% new oak adds a rich coating of smoky, buttered toast. The wine is dramatic, rather than subtle, and is at its best now.
This is an oaky Merlot that's thick with black olive and blackberry flavors, encased in a wall of dark chocolate and roasted coffee. Somewhere in the midst of it all is also a taste of bread.
This is the best of Cru's 2010 Pinot Noirs, and it shows real Santa Lucia complexity. It's a dry wine, with brisk acids and supple tannins. It has a flashy core of cherry, red currant, licorice and smoky, sweet sandalwood flavors. Drink this over the next 2–3 years.
Although this blend smells a bit loamy and earthy, there's plum, cherry and cinnamon aromas that are frontal in their attack. The palate is serious and tight, with medium-strength tannins and flavors of baked berry, spice and coffee. On the finish, pepper and olive notes enter the frame. Drink now–2017.
Appetizing peardrop notes on the nose lead to a light, refreshing and dry body that's enlivened by fresh spritz. The flavors get a boost of citrus on the clean, refreshing finish.
The previous two years we did not find this wine to be worthy of a rating. This time, we rate it but note that it's an almost-red wine made from Cabernet Sauvignon. It's sweet smelling, with fiery plum-skin flavors that evaporate along with the mouthfeel. Leaves a burn patch on the finish. Particular to the max.
Focused and fresh, this has aromas of berry and integrated citrus. It feels rubbery and lush, with acidic cut and roasted flavors of plum, blackberry and leather. It finishes mildly roasted and earthy, with a leathery lasting impression.
This blend of 49% Roussanne, 36% Grenache Blanc and 15% Viognier hits the nose with lemon zest, cooked apples and a bit of banana. It's very fresh on the palate, with honeysuckle, green apples and a pear skin tension, enhanced with wisps of smokiness.
Pale gold in color. Slightly sweet and candied aromas prevail: pear drops and white flowers. Similar flavors appear on the fairly light-bodied palate. This is fresh, fruity and easy to drink, but lacking any great depth or flavor intensity. A slight bitter note is noticeable on the finish.
The regular aromas and flavors of Sauvignon Blanc are here but faint—citrus, grass—and there's a stinky egg quality that overrides the whole. Earthy but odd, this wine may be a tough one to love, but it also has an interesting charm.
This is a smooth, apricot- and pear-flavored wine that has attractive acidity. It's fresh, fruity and immediately drinkable as an apéritif or with seafood.
This is the inaugural release from this winery that focuses on the expression of Cabernet in a different site each year. It's dazzling, rich with blackberry, black currant, herb, dark chocolate and barrel spices. The full-bodied flavors are candy-bar sweet with some chewy tannic heft that bodes well for its potential in the cellar.
Veteran winemaker Richard Arrowood has turned to this well-known vineyard for this Rhône blend of Grenache Blanc, Viognier, Roussanne and Marsanne. It's a nice wine, slightly sweet and savory in peach, pear, green apple, apricot, honeysuckle and vanilla flavors. Crisp acidity adds valuable balance.
Round and generous, but with a mineral heart that gives structure to this full wine. It has weight, dense fruit and delicious peach and nectarine flavors. The structure suggests this Morgeot has the potential to age.
This easygoing Chard starts off with hints of toasted cashew and pineapple, then folds in flavors of melon and citrus. It's medium-bodied and well-made, just thins out a little on the finish. Drink now.
This unique Syrah vineyard is located at the northwestern edge of the Columbia Valley AVA. Exotic, silky and compelling, the aromas and flavors combine gorgeously sleek berry fruit flavors with a foundation of liquid rock (hence the vineyard name). Supple, authoritative and long, it gathers both strength and subtlety as it breathes.
A light, ethereal wine akin to Gamay Noir, made in an easy-to-consume-often style, with beautiful aromatics of just-ripe cherry and raspberry and a rose garden in bloom. Juicy and soft, the wine is balanced and appealing in every way and makes for a fun introduction to a rare grape in California.
This opens with a touch of reduced oak, never letting go of its sizable full-bodied cradling of wood and tannin. In the glass it begins to unfold and reveal juicy, rich red currant, cassis and berry seasoned in clove.
This blend of 50% Merlot, 23% Cabernet Sauvignon, 12% Malbec, 10% Petit Verdot and 5% Cabernet Franc shows cocoa dust, leather, beef jerky, dried blueberries and boysenberries on the nose. The palate is dense with tarry fruit notes, offering dark elderberries and smoked beef flavors.
This Brunello opens with elegantly on the nose, with small berry, cassis and wild blueberry aromas. Beyond the steady, feminine bouquet is a wine that has power, determination and personality, with savory endnotes of spice and fresh pipe tobacco.
This 16th century chateau with towers is in the northern Médoc. The wine is spicy with the wood aging still showing. At the same time, the ripe black-currant fruit is developing well and as it ages further, the wine will become finely balanced. With 60% Cabernet in the blend, this is a wine for the long term. Drink from 2019.
The oak jumps out a bit, with plenty of vanilla and a bit of dill, too. A medium-bodied Merlot, still young and tannic and not yet unwrapped. Additional cellar time will help. —P.G.
The high alcohol may be a stumbling block for some palates, but this wine is nonetheless absolutely delicious. Sourced from a vineyard planted in 1972, it was aged in 50% new French oak. It's intense and detailed, with hints of wintergreen, a broad streak of cherry cola, and finishing licks of molasses, brown sugar and coffee.
This structured rosato from northern Italy is loaded with bright red cherry, raspberry, black pepper and graphite sensations. The round, juicy palate is balanced by lively acidity that gives a refreshing finish.
A rubbery, rustic nose starts out stalky and gritty before settling down. This is closed in feel, with stalky, almost burnt dark-berry flavors that end similarly, with stalky, herbal notes.
Here's a soft, rather one-dimensional Pinot Noir for drinking now. Nothing terribly complicated going on, just a good, sound dry wine with pleasant berry, spice and oak flavors.
There's a grassy note of dried hay or fennel seed at the open of the bouquet that is followed by clove and sweet orange zest. The wine is disjointed and awkward in places.
Malbec may well be the next red grape to emerge as a star in Washington State, once the young vines have a few more vintages behind them. This is 100% varietal. Light and elegant, it's nicely detailed with a peppery, floral character and a welcome persistence. Take the best qualities of Beresan's Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Syrah and mix them into a single, more delicate varietal, and you have this lovely Malbec, which glides along to a finish with chocolaty, satiny tannins.
Ripe berry, underbrush, scorched earth, menthol, baking spice and a hint of leather meld together on this. The ripe, delicious palate doles out crushed raspberry, juicy Marasca cherry, white pepper and espresso alongside a tannic backbone. A tobacco note wraps around the finish. Drink 2019–2027.
The aromas are all high toned, with barrel notes of exotic spice, vanilla and medicine cabinet. The red-fruit flavors bring a sense of elegance and distinction.
This blend smells outright herbaceous and weedy. An astringent volatile palate is grating, while this tastes much like it smells: weedy and green.
Jon Martinez, who arrived in Washington barely six years ago, is knocking the ball out of the park. Improving with each new release, he has locked in a stellar collection of vineyards, and made Rhône-style wines his focus. This is a revelation. Pure berries, cassis, rock, earth, licorice, and a hint of baking spices. Gorgeous.
The sweetest style of Madeira still has that wonderful burnt acidity that keeps it from being cloying. So while there is an initial toffee character, the wine then tightens up with orange marmalade and an intense acidity. Drink this beautiful wine now.
This is a satisfying, small-production wine from four rows of the family's Kairos Vineyard, a study in sanguine intensity. Currant, cassis and tar integrate with the body of subtle oak and tannin, finishing in a sprinkling of dried herb and graphite.
Vibrant, fruity and dry now, with savory black currant, red currant, plum and cherry flavors, this Cab also has a spicy, minty quality that makes it come alive on the palate. It's young and tannic, and will benefit from up to eight years in the cellar.
Neutral on the nose except for some oily rusticity. The palate is full with okay acidity and sweet flavors suggestive of mango, pineapple and melon.
Apple and pear fruit is set in a frame of citrus, grapefruit flesh and rind. Skin flavors are well modulated, with a hint of minerality, as well. This is wine is drinking nicely—clean and persistent.
Slightly funk kiwi, dried apples and dried white-flower aromas show on the nose of this appellation blend. Flavors are flat and muted, with a flash of sweet apples.
The producer sources from older plantings of both Zin and Petite Sirah, of which there is 5% in this wine. Given more than a year in American oak, it's velvety on the palate with brown sugar, oak and high-toned raspberry, easily enjoyable on its own or on the table.
Plump but not overripe raspberry and alpine strawberry notes greet the nose on this bottling, with hints of shiitake mushrooms, turned earth and lavender. There's lots of herbal depth and chaparral character on the palate, with a touch of candied cherry, all presented with zesty energy that buzzes through the sip.
Beautiful aromas of rose and lavender open this wine, followed by intense mushroom, truffle and earth. Bright in acidity, a wild strawberry flavor sharpens the focus as soft, well-integrated tannins and subtle oak intermingle. The entire package finishes with a bang of crisp red-cherry fruit.
This bright and luminous Soave delivers a fruit and floral-based bouquet with undertones of citrus and Golden Delicious apple. Pair this wine with tomato and basil bruschetta.
Intense aromas of lemon, lime, tropical fruit and white flowers lead the nose. On the slightly sweet palate, a hint of aromatic herbs offsets green apple, kiwi and citrus. It closes on a note of candied nectarine zest.
Leathery aromas blend well with concentrated black-fruit scents. In the mouth, this value-priced Malbec offers juicy purity and plenty of spunk. Flavors of black fruits, licorice and chocolate maintain a sense of freshness, while the finish offers residual blackberry and cassis flavors.
Smells of sweet berries, apples and grapes. On the palate, it's a food-sized wine, but it's not very distinctive varietally (cut it some slack, it's a blended wine). Just the kind of no-brainer you want for pizza night. Grenache, Shiraz and Mourvedre. 15,000 cases produced.
Delicate and complex, a cool climate wine with a mixture of ripe cherry flavors and leaner ones of tobacco, tomato skin, and cranberry. Bone dry with excellent acidity, this somewhat tart wine is well made, and may be an ager.
As fresh as they come, with bright strawberry flavors touched by caramel and red currant acidity. For drinking this summer.
This young, fruity and ripe wine blends 75% Merlot and 25% Cabernet Sauvignon. The generous tannic structure goes with the red fruits and the light acidity. A juicy texture will allow it to age quickly. Drink from 2017. The Gondreau family is a member of Alliance Bourg.
Barnard Griffin is family-owned, yet competes, both in terms of price and quality, with the biggest wineries in the state. This Chardonnay is reliable year in and year out, but is especially fine in 2009, with wonderful definition. Fresh herbs, crisp green apple and citrus fruit, a full, spicy, tangy mouthfeel, and above all, a lingering and clean finish, make this a terrific value.
A nice, slightly sweet white wine, with tropical fruit, buttered toast, white flower and vanilla flavors. Easy to drink as a cocktail sipper.
A McLaren Vale standard bearer, the 2010 Hillside is a complex, beguiling example of Shiraz. Toast and vanilla notes frame hints of raspberries, herbs and espresso on the nose, while the flavors add olive-tinged elements. Despite showing ample weight, this isn't the biggest wine, just one that shows impressive harmony and length. Drink now through at least 2025.
Very soft and dull, it offers white fruits and some acidity. Drink now.
Here's a cheerful and bright Prosecco that delivers enticing aromas of dried hay, field flower, peach and light lemon zest. Tonic, lively bubbling would match fried finger foods.
This has a rubbery, smoky nose, as if it were caught between a campfire and a burning tire. Tangy, snappy and grabby around the edges, this also has a resiny, lactic oak flavor blanketing the robust berry fruit. It finishes grabby, with raspberry and herb notes.
Aromas of dried tobacco leaf, toast, oak and underbrush lead the nose. The bright, approachable palate offers black cherry, espresso and star anise alongside fine-grained tannins and fresh acidity.
A delicious, crafted Brunello that celebrates Montalcino tradition. One panelist was especially fond of its cola berry, forest underbrush, plum, charcoal, granite and vanilla notes. Medium structure, but very well distributed throughout the palate with rich tannins and a long berry finish. Imported by Vias Imports.
This is a light and leafy effort, whose soft and forward fruit mixes flavors of leaf, beet, tomato and red fruits. It is balanced but insubstantial.
Oaky, supple and structured, this features fresh green apple fruit and plenty of toasty new oak. It's just well made, mostly barrel-fermented (one-third was new French oak) and captures the broad, fruit-driven, barrel-enhanced flavors that make Chardonnay so popular.
Cascina La Ghersa offers a complete picture of the Barbera grape through its Vignassa line of wines. This successful vintage delivers mature aromas of cassis and blackberry backed by cola and spice.
This unique red blend from New Mexico has a nose of candied spice and a smooth but structured character of red berry, spice and a touch of sweetness. It's not terribly complex but the flavors are good and the overall impression appealing.
Tastes too sweet by far, with sugared black cherry, currant, prune and tobacco flavors. The sweetness may be partially attributed to high alcohol. With thick tannins, this Zin is just too rustic to merit a higher score.
Here's a cheerful but simple expression of Nebbiolo that opens with aromas of leather, dried fruit, earth and crushed white pepper. The tannins are smooth, fine and silky.
If it weren't for a fresh, reasonable mouthfeel, this would be a disaster. Aromatically, it's all pyrazines and funk. Flavorwise, it's herbaceous and rough, like celery and nettles. Bitter on the finish.
Ripe and fruity, this is a Chardonnay that will appeal to fans of the modern style. Brims with pineapples, lemons, limes and green apples, with a touch of vanilla cream.
Sesta di Sopra delivers a superb and beautiful Brunello with impossible richness and gorgeous intensity. Aromas include black cherry, vanilla, dark mocha, freshly ground espresso and a subtle touch of mineral dryness at the end. It's equally impressive on the palate with smooth, thick intensity.
Lush and creamy in texture, this shows just how good some relatively inexpensive Barossa Shiraz can be. Elements of graham cracker, espresso, dark chocolate and baking spices are bolstered by ample weight and berry fruit. Enjoy this velvety wine over the short term—by 2018 or so.
There's a slightly sour smell to this offering from Coomber Family, who produce “wines for animal lovers.” However, the sipping experience is pleasant enough, with hard cherry candy, a range of spices and a lingering licorice finish.
Bing cherries rise to the top of the aroma profile, but the flavors, like many 2011s, appear unwilling to share themselves in any forward way, even after the wine is opened for some time. It necessitates much searching to get past the tart and lean vintage to find the limited but characteristic flavors of Pinot Noir.
This ambitious brand continues to struggle, in its organic-biodynamic way, to master its Mendocino terroir. This Merlot is clean, dry and very pure, with cherry flavors, yet it needs greater intensity and complexity, and a longer finish.
The nose is rather subdued. The palate comes in with the ripe freshness of orange flesh and peel. There is a lovely zesty pleasantly bitter frame that lends structure and acts as a counterweight to the slight fruit sweetness. The off-dry palate is poised and balanced, with an almost dry finish. This is restrained and elegant.
Enantio is a little-known indigenous grape of northern Italy and this is a rare, 100% expression of the variety. The nose here is subdued and clean with shadings of ripe cherry, spice and leather. The wine shows a touch of bitterness on the close and fresh acidity is reigned in by the wine's soft, polished finish.
More than most wineries, Bogle knows how to make fairly priced varietal wines that stand up to the competition. The wine has plenty of Chardonnay character, with oak-infused tropical fruit, green apple and pear flavors. With production at 600,000 cases, it's a remarkable achievement. The fruit is from Clarksburg and Monterey County.
Union Wine Company, which now owns Amity, makes a number of good-value, well-structured Pinots. Add this one to the list. Aged 11 months in 15% new French oak, it's pleasingly fruity (raspberry and cherry) but doesn't stop there. The touch of barrel-aging adds coffee and caramel highlights.
Soft and a bit heavy, with jammy flavors of cherries, raspberries, anise, cedar and mocha. Delicious in the sheer voluptuousness of these tastes, but could use firmer structure.
The wine is hard, tough and dense. Its tannins are solid, dominant, extracted and cover any fruit. It is likely to remain dry.
Tastes ripe and extracted, with pie-filling flavors of cherries and blackberries and, of course, the usual overlay of oak. It's also pretty hard in tannins. Could mellow out, but not showing well now.
Spicy and sharp, with mountain berries and slightly green, bitter tannins. Young and tight, this needs more time to knit itself together.
Tobacco and spice aromas precede a palate that has some weight, the tannins quite dry and tight but in balance with the red berry fruits. Spicy wood also shows, while the final acidity is almost too fresh.
Billowy, expansive tannins remain round and approachable on the palate of this generously ripe wine, juicy in black cherry and plum. The robust fruit is complemented by savory tinges of cedar and leather.
The top cuvée from Mercer Estates, this reserve is a Bordeaux-style blend based upon 64% Merlot, the rest a mix of Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec and Petit Verdot. A firm entry introduces a solid mid-palate with a mix of black fruits, coffee and toast. The finish is clean and gentle, with moderate persistence.
A compact bouquet with dense aromas of leafy berry fruits and compost is not entirely fresh and pure. On the palate, this is packed with pulpy fruit, but there's isn't much nuance. Short, stocky berry, plum and spice flavors finish fleshy but a touch leafy and abrasive. Drink through 2028.
Smooth and supple, this wine is full of ripe, generous fruit and acidity. It's framed with firm tannins, however, that lend structure to a palate that has weight and a luscious feel. Drink from 2018.
This is a very rich Pinot whose primary virtue is fruit. It just explodes with delicious cherry jam, red currant, licorice and mocha flavors. Dry and crisply acidic, it's a beautiful wine for early drinking.
An aroma like black pepper and turned earth leads to flavors that are more savory and smoky than fruity. This is a sturdy, fairly tannic and full-bodied wine that wants to pair with rich proteins.
This traditionally crafted Barolo presents a gorgeous bouquet of dried rose petal, violet and truffle with hints of forest floor and leather. The palate delivers juicy wild cherry and berry flavors, layered with mint and balsamic herbs and shows great depth and balance. It is loaded with finesse, and with time will develop even more complexity.
Everyone who follows Spain and the Mediterranean basin knows that 2002 was a cool, miserly year. But still, this wine is offering almost nothing. It's tart, limited and borderline sour. There isn't much middle or body to it, so expect scratchy red fruit and lots of wayward acidity.
Barbazzale is a 50-50 blend of Inzolia and Viognier. A touch of burnt matchstick blows off after a few minutes in the glass. Once the wine opens, it offers a full and generous mouthfeel and stone fruit flavors.
Pomegranate, concentrated cola, brown dirt and oregano aromas emerge on the nose of this blend of 41% Zinfandel, 37% Cabernet Sauvignon and 22% Sangiovese. Light and subtle flavors of raspberry juice, boysenberry, black rocks and chocolate nibs prove pleasant thought not overly complex.
This is pretty oaky stuff, loaded with toast and cedar aromas, but still showing some lush blueberry fruit underneath. It's a wine that's fleshed out by supple tannins, moderately high alcohol and drenched in eau de fût neuf, yet finds a precarious balance among those items. Probably best to drink now.
Rondineto is a sharp and thorny wine with strange aromas of pickled fruit, green olive or caper. The mouthfeel is thin and crisp.
Stylistically speaking, this oak-aged wine is very different from all of Borsao's fruit-first Garnachas. And that isn't exactly a full-out compliment. So while the wine has balance and structure, the oak seems dominant on the nose and palate, which lends more vanilla and cream than spice and character.
A soft, ripe wine with peach flavors, it has an attractively rich feel that is balanced by citrus and apple acidity. Very fruity, the wine is ready to drink.
Big, firm tannins dominate this structured wine. New wood aging shows, giving a very dry feeling. It's also rich and full in the mouth, packed with ripe black plum and berry flavors. It's going to balance well and richly. Drink from 2018.
Smooth and polished, and just happens to be delicious. You'll find clean, soft flavors of lime, orange zest, honeydew melon and spice, with oaky shadings.
Gramona is known for yeasty, complex sparklers, and this falls into that paradigm. The nose is definitely yeasty, with apple and green melon aromas. It's a bit soft for Cava, but that's because it's an '05 that rested on lees for years. Flavors of toasted bread and apple are long on complexity and short on fruit, but once again that's what distinguishes Gramona from the masses.
Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon make up most of this blend. Aromas of vanilla, spice and red and black fruit lead to soft-feeling fruit and barrel flavors that put a focus on elegance.
K-J's basic Cab has gotten pricier over the years, but quality has kept up. This wine still offers excellent value. It's elegant in construction, with tailored tannins and acids and fine flavors of blackberries and currants that lead to a spicy finish.
Here's a pert Pecorino, with bright citrus and tropical fruit sensations of lemon, tangerine and pineapple. A subtle note of flinty mineral on the close jazzes this up a bit, but overall this is a simple and enjoyable wine to enjoy with everyday fare.
An enticing mix of lime zest and very ripe, juicy pear present the first impression and unite in a linear, racy palate. As the wine opens in the glass, spicier edges appear: apricot kernels and marzipan make an appearance and promise future flavour development. With thrillingly fresh acidity and a lip-smacking finish, it's almost irresistible now, but with this sort of concentration certainly also good for laying down.
While rather closed on the nose, this fresh, straightforward red shows ripe, red cherry on the palate with a generous, rounded mouthfeel and soft tannins. Uncomplicated and for immediate drinking.
This blend of Sangiovese, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah has aromas of black fruit, cedar and oak. The dense palate is a bit forward, reflecting the vintage, and delivers black cherry, black currant, toasted oak and spice notes along with bracing tannins.
Heady notes of flower and ripe, fleshy stone fruit perfume this dry yet lusciously fruity, full-bodied Riesling. Brisk lime-like acidity, a note of fresh green herb and a smoky, crushed-stone minerality add a cutting edge on the finish.
A rich, earthy blend of half Barbera, half Zinfandel that tastes light at first, earthy with raspberry and cherry tones. On the finish, it gets darker, its spicy, dark fruit tones memorably bound in a wall of leather and tobacco.
Rich and creamy, this beguiling wine offers a counterweight of lightness and balance, finding as much lemon and lime zest as baked apple and pear within its layers of flavor. Lifted in minerality, it offers accents of vanilla and honey on the finish, making the wine both complex and completely delicious.
Clean, taut green apple and zesty lemon are the chief markers of this slender, dry wine. It holds lots of refreshment and has a racy core. Have this on its own when in need of refreshment, or have it with food when there is light, subtle fare.
This spicy blend of native grape Agiorgitiko and Cabernet offers a muscular nose of leather, tobacco and earthy dried herbs, and on the palate, cherry, leather and tobacco. It's a slightly rustic blend that will benefit from aging, but paired with grilled meats is good now. Imported by American Wine Distributors.
Big and fruity, and for the most part holds together and exhibits more good qualities than its faults. The flavor profile drives full-bodied black fruit and a finish that cuts out quietly. Not over the top in any way.
A sinewy wine that begins with ginger, lemon curd and white peach that give way to a slightly watery palate with a silky texture and good acidity to balance the substantial residual sugar. The short-to-medium finish ends on a candied ginger note. Drink now.
Santa Cecilia opens with the aromas that define the Nero d'Avola grape. There are touches of almond and Bronte pistachio, followed by blackberry, plum and cherry notes. A smoky mineral tone appears on the finish, and the wine is fresh and well structured.
Pronounced notes of butter, cheese and canned cream corn dominate this savory Chardonnay. It's a rather fat, cream-textured wine but sunny tangerine acidity and fresher notes of apple and pear flavors do get a peek through the midpalate.
While this Cabernet is very rich and ripe in flavors of blackberry and cherry jam, crème de cassis and new oak, it's also very tannic. That bite of astringency gives it a rustic note. A very high, Port-like alcohol level may or may not thwart cellaring plans.
Sharp and mildly oily aromas, with pithy orange and lemon flavors. The palate hits with expected sharpness, with a touch of veggies on the finish. Too angular, tart and pointy.
The Calderara Sottana cru delivers wines with a more noticeable mineral presence. You'll get volcanic nuances of ash, smoke and slate backed by delicate flowers and small berry fruit. There's also a charming touch of rusticity here (especially evident in the wine's powerful, alcoholic finish), but that's what we liked about it.
Partial whole-cluster fermentation gives this wine a chewy, spicy density, while new oak adds a flamboyant sweetness to the underlying cherry and blackberry fruit. The result is dry, rich, complex and ageworthy. Best after 2011, if you can keep your hands off it.
Without any wood aging, the wine shows just the yeastiness from aging on the lees. That fills the palate with spice and a touch of pepper. The wine needs a little more time. Drink from 2018.
Owned by the Bordeaux Castel family, this estate has produced a simple, light wine packed with fruit. It's light and bright, with just a hint of earthiness that takes away from the freshness. The aftertaste adds lemon crispness.
Cor's Bordeaux blend is a mix of 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, 21% Merlot, 28% Petit Verdot and 21% Malbec. Not surprisingly, the PV dominates, crafting a dark, earthy, coffee-scented wine. The blend works well, and overall the mouthfeel is smooth and supple, the fruit flavors sharp and tart.
Sweaty and thin, this wine has little character or appeal. Soupy, vegetal and tannic.
Tropical and zesty on the nose, with a big shot of lemon blossom and a secondary note of melon. The palate is juicy, fresh and sort of lean, with lemon, pineapple and green apple flavors. Arguably tart and angular, but at least it's clean and crisp.
Very mineral in style, this is a structured, textured wine with good aging potential. It's acidity, still pronounced and up front, reveals itself with crisp citrus flavors that accent warm yellow fruits. The wine needs a year or two before drinking, so wait until 2015.
Austin Hope's latest releases are all about power and ripeness, and this blend of 35% Grenache, 35% Mourvèdre and 30% Syrah achieves balance and elegance amidst that strength. Cuban coffee, fig jam, dried blueberry and chocolate aromas lead into a pillowy-soft palate that's layered with espresso, cocoa, roasted fig and plum jam flavors. Steady acidity and finely chiseled tannins frame it all.
A lusty value made right. The nose issues black cherry, cough drop and cassis aromas. It's concentrated and balanced, while flavors of black cherry and cassis follow the nose. A mild tannic burn and chocolate on the finish tell you it's good and can go with any meat, from burgers to a quality steak or roast.
Lemony and toasty, this approachable wine is rich and balanced, its texture soft and the flavors long-lasting, highlighted by a taste of lemon meringue.
Nice herbal notes unfold in the bouquet with notes of lime rind, underripe peach and soft bell pepper coming through in the mouth. The finish is clean, like fresh-cut grass, and the overall experience enjoyable.
This is soft and juicy with just a hint of a more tannic structure in the background. It is designed as an immediate easy-drinking wine, full of fruit and blackberry fruits.
This is a ripe, succulent white, dark golden in color, that's lush and expansive on the palate in fleshy tropical and stone fruit. Toasted oak comes forward on the finish, accentuating the wine's nearly full-bodied nature, never getting in the way of the minerality.
A pleasant wine, with mild melon, mineral, citrus, peach and herb flavors. Light textured, medium bodied and quite refreshing. Clean on the finish.
San Lorenzo opens with bright cherry fruit and blueberry with subtle background notes of almond paste and dried tobacco. Overall, this clean and fresh red wine would pair with roast chicken or turkey.
Very ripe, in fact, shows signs of overripeness in the raisiny notes accompanying the plums and coffee. The mouthfeel is heavy and Syrah-like, but with a silky texture. Good wine but needs more delicacy and breed.
Apricot and honey lead this delicate Riesling, and on the palate, a poised balance of sweet and spicy keeps the wine aloft. Citrus and a floral note are woven throughout, creating complexity and elegance. Imported by Wine Emporium.
Hints of smoke and toasted brioche meld deliciously with sweet, ripe melon tones in this pristine semisweet Riesling from Heron Hill. Juicy and ripe in texture, with concentrated peach and tangerine flavors, its elegantly structured, with zippy acidity and a hint of tea leaf astringency on the finish.
Packed with fruit, minerality and impressive wood-aging flavors, this is a single-parcel wine of immense power. Black fruits and tannin share the honors, giving structure and density. It's a wine for long-term aging, solid and concentrated. Drink from 2019.
This opens with aromas of cherry marinated in spirits, coffee and a balsamic note that carry over to the tightly wound palate along with licorice and sage. Bracing tannins give it an astringent finish.
This is textbook Rioja gran reserva from a ripe, generous year. Aromas of cassis and prune blend with toasty, creamy oak. Fresh acidity is a lifesaver, because the tannins and oak level are up there. Flavors of tobacco, currant, vanilla and red plum end with a reprise of crisp acids and oak. This will last another 20 years before any fading comes into play.
Fun and refreshing, this opens with subtle aromas of yellow apple, citrus, lemon pastry and hazelnut that follow through to the palate. It's fresh, with bright acidity and a persistent, frothy perlage.
Here's a very good, very generous and rewarding Pinot Noir. Firmed up with crisp acidity and some fairly thick tannins, it nonetheless has a silky, appealing texture, and is vast in red currant, rhubarb, cola, beefsteak heirloom tomato, cedar and spice flavors. Feels important and elegant in the mouth. Best now and through 2013.
Dense and dark to the point of being slightly liqueur-like, it bursts with notes of rich black fruit, licorice, tar, smoke and espresso. The wine seems to hang on the palate for an extraordinarily long time, continuing on like an endless coal mine.
Dusty-scented cherry fruit, hints of barn and earth, and a blend that includes 11% Cabernet Sauvignon. The nose on this wine promises more than it delivers in the mouth, where it turns acidic and hard, with green tannins.
Gyles Webb, whose spectacular vineyards drench the slopes of the Simonsberg mountain, was once better known for his great-value Sauvignon Blanc and for his reds. But his Chardonnay is as good as the rest of the range, full of tangy marmalade flavors and a well-judged use of oak, which supports rather than dominates the delicious citrus character of the wine.
This is a generous wine, although one that will need some serious aging. It is rich in tannins and powered by a firm structure. The fruit offers the weight to counter the tannins. It just needs time. Drink from 2024.
Not explosively aromatic, but that may make this Gewürz easier to warm up to for some consumers. It's filled with pear and peach flavors, rounded out by a touch of residual sugar (to most tasters, it will come across as dry), and finishes with a pinch of peppery spice. Imported by Cordon Selections.
Delicate sweet-pea and white-flower aromas marry into forward fruit notes of fresh pear and hard apricot. A mineral streak weaves through the lush palate, and a peach pit nuttiness lingers into the finish. Accessible and enjoyable now.
One of the best Cab Francs out there, intricately structured and rich in terroir character. It's lighter in body than a Cab Sauv, with cherry, mocha, caramel, vanilla, dusty oriental spice and anise flavors that unfold in waves. Totally addictive and elegant.
Too soft by far, with sugary sweet, medicinal cherry-berry flavors and a sharp cut of acidity. Tastes like an inexpensive Port.
Blue flower, plum cake, coconut and exotic spice aromas come together in the glass. The opulent, firmly structured palate delivers blackberry extract, chocolate covered cherry, vanilla and star anise alongside grippy tannins.
Made from 100% Chardonnay grapes, this bubbly is dry, elegant and will take some bottle age. It has rich and complex, but subtle, flavors of grilled peaches, pears, brioche, vanilla and smoke, with a spicy finish. Give it a few years for the edges to smooth out.
Hazy aromatics of sautéed apple and baking spice mark the nose, with notes of toasted nut and dill that surface on the palate. It feels full, round and supple, gaining some lift toward the close.
This aromatic wine is at the same time structured and tough. Its redeeming feature is the berry fruit layer that is waiting to show through from 2015.
Far more tannic and closed down than most Oakville Bordeaux red wines, this Merlot's dry tannins are its main feature. It's tough, dry and astringent, with a core of black cherries, currants and smoky oak. But it shows promise. Try cellaring through 2012.
Quite buttery and rich, this bottling shows lemon custard, ripe yellow melon, white peach and buttermilk on the lavish nose. The palate is lush and attention-grabbing, with poached and grilled peach flavors lifted by citrus energy and a vanilla-laced finish.
Here's a Pinot to enjoy now with steak, or try a Julia Child-inspired coq au vin. It's big and sturdy and ripe, with cherry, currant, licorice and beef teriyaki flavors that finish in a swirl of spices. The tannins are substantial. Give it a few hours of decanting.
A savory, woody accent runs through this medium-bodied, earthy and attractive wine made from “America's oldest Zinfandel vineyard.” The mouthfeel is quite smooth, with ample blackberry and strawberry flavors that soak the palate.
Blended with 10% Cabernet Sauvignon, this medium-weight effort carries scents of tomato leaf and Mediterranean herbs. Those highlights continue into the palate, with pomegranate fruit and a dry pleasant lightly herbal character.
91-93 Barrel sample. If you're looking for great, ripe black currant fruits, this is where to come. The wine is full and hugely fruity, but it still manages a good Bordeaux sense of proportion.
So sweet and caramelized in smoky oak, it tastes almost like a dessert wine. There might even be some leftover sugar in the wine. Yet it has brisk, refreshing acidity, and there's no denying the deliciousness of the pineapple and lemon-pie flavors.
Big and chunky, packed with opulent fruit, primarily ripe black plums and raisins. It is defiantly rich, shot through with acidity and dry tannins for aging.
Very faint peach notes break through the lemony freshness of this slender, golden wine. The usually richer, more sumptuous nature of Zierfandler shines through on the textured palate and in the glimpses of generous oiliness that flank the edges of the central citrus focus. This is lovely now but will reward cellaring. The finish is poised and clean-cut, lemony and long.
From a small region just north of Pouilly Fumé, this is light and fruity. It's soft, just herbaceous and full of green apple and grapefruit flavors that give a fresh, lively character. It's completely ready to drink.
A beautiful Cabernet Franc, dry, soft and supple, with a silky texture that glides across the palate with such smoothness. It conveys pleasantly complex flavors of red cherry essence, with hints of nutmeg, anise and sweet sandalwood. Not an ager, but a fine wine to drink now—especially with steak.
All red fruit, red cherries and the lightest tannins. This is full-bodied and exuberant, with the typical acidity of young Beaujolais.
Bright aromas of fresh flowers and orange rind lead to sweet fruit flavors. Enjoy it for dessert.
Cherry fruit and a strong herbal, earthy component tells the story here. The fruit shows some concentration, but at the expense of rough tannins and a bit of heat in the finish.
Cutting, fresh apple, lemon and lime reverberate throughout this zesty Chardonnay sparkling wine. The palate is exceptionally fine in texture with a softly mouth-filling mousse. The finish is tinged by a pleasant swathe of green herbs and lime zest.
Dryish, with flavors of rosehip tea, sugared green tea, cherries and pepper. Okay for a picnic or from a cooler on the beach.
Waxy but also plenty acidic, which creates some clash on the bouquet. Flavors of lemon, orange and peach meet a little bitterness on the finish, and overall this won't be confused for French Viognier. It's scattershot and unique, but it has finishing harmony and a pretty good texture.
Petite Syrah (as it is spelled here) is no longer an approved label—Petite Sirah is correct—but this wine takes a good run a capturing the power and pleasure of the grape. Dark and tannic, it brings in plum and a hint of prune, also chocolate and earth, with good balance.
Kiona Vineyard on Red Mountain provides the fruit for this wine, along with Chandler Reach in the Yakima Valley. Baking spice, clove and anise aromas are followed by light, tart red fruit flavors that trail slightly toward the spice filled finish.
A bit heavy for a rosé, without quite the liveliness you want. It's a very fruity wine, with forward raspberry, vanilla, cocoa and spice flavors.
Aromas are light but show oxygen exposure along with barrel spice. The cherry and herb flavors are simultaneously plump and elegant.
This is a surprisingly early release for the grape, which the winery ages on American and French oak. Tar and pepper are already ready on the nose, but the elements could use some time to coalesce. Right now, there are slightly sour blackberries and a woody bitterness, proving to be more about texture and tannins than flavors. Give it until 2016
This is a big, ripe, full-bodied and oaky Pinot Noir. It's too powerful to drink now, unless you don't mind immaturity. The raspberry, cherry and blood orange flavors are of the pie-filling type, and the oak sticks out in smoky, vanilla sweetness. Give it 4–5 years in the cellar to come around.
This is Bouchard's hallmark Beaune, a blend from different premier cru vineyards. The wine is dense, firm and dominated by dark tannins, which offer good aging potential. The sweet tomato acidity and black berry fruits merge with a noticeable flavor of wood—the combo still needs time to fully balance out. Wait at least four years.
The match of 70% Sangiovese and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon seems perfect. The wine's great ability is in offering soft, round cherry tones backed by more typical notes of forest berry and blue flower. Its texture is plush, and the vibrant midpalate closes with bright fruit.
Sharp and penetrating, vertically structured, and just now coming out of its youthful shell, the 2006 is beginning to show its long- term aging potential. Compact blueberry and blackberry fruit comes with a hint of black olive; it's ripe, quite firm and wrapped into chewy tannins and natural acids, with a lemony finish.
A stacked nose includes aromas of tomato, herbs, cocoa, molasses and berry fruits. The saturated palate announces that this is a big one, while spicy flavors of plum and berry fruits are slightly herbal on a finish with excellent feel and flow. Drink this blend of Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon and Carmenère through 2021.
A few swirls of the glass release delicate, enticing aromas of red berry, rose, iris, tobacco, new leather and star anise on this elegant, almost ethereal wine. The restrained palate sneaks up you, offering tart cherry, crushed strawberry, white pepper and a note of black tea alongside a backbone of firm, refined tannins. Still primary and tight, it needs a few more years to fully open up and develop. Drink 2020–2031.
Light and brigh, it comes from tSanta Barbara County grape-growing pioneer Louis Lucas. Aromas of orange juice, passionfruit and sugared grapefruit peel create a strong introduction. On the floral-laced palate, pear cider and night jasmine flavors make for a solid sipper if not particularly complex.
Costa Russi presents a dark wall of ripe fruit and an exotic spice shading that give momentum and power to the finish. There are also notes of plum, dark chocolate, tobacco, licorice and tar. The quality of the tannins is firm and polished; this should evolve over many years to come.
Soft chalk and white florals add interest to the bouquet of this Chard. The mouth is more typical with flavors of mushy peach, mealy red apple and sweet Clementine citrus. A creamy texture veers toward feeling a bit fat, but the finish is clean. Drink now.
This is one of several estates in this cru appellation where Georges Duboeuf makes and markets the wine. It is lightly wood aged to smooth out the ebullient fruits. Rich and with some firm tannins that will develop, it has concentration and a dense texture. Drink from 2018.
This might be the best value Pinot out there. Light in color and strong in Bing cherry flavor and aroma, smoothly textured and well-balanced, it's made from organic grapes to boot. A fine and rare example of a Mendocino Pinot that's not overly complicated or fussy.
A fascinating nose that's threaded with mint, earth, cassis and coffee, leads into a dense and saturated palate, with complex layers of herb and fruit. This wine dances across the tongue. It's not too big, but complex and complicated, ending on a blood-orange-tinged finish.
This is a ripe, structured wine. It has complex black fruits and layers of spice from wood aging. Dominated by Alicante Bouschet, it is dark in color, packed with dense tannins and needing to age. Drink from 2017.
A surprising  Pinot Noir from the Puget Sound AVA. Tart, tannic and lightly spicy, it presents itself as a rustic café red.
Youthful tannins and ageability always characterize this Cab, which contains a splash of Syrah. Like its predecessors, it's very dry, with herb-infused cherry and currant flavors, and new oak plays only a supporting role. It's really an elegant wine and a great value at this price.
Opens with pleasant, traditional aromas of dried red fruits, spice and citrus peel. The wine has a mature feel with tomato, dried currant, raspberry and light mocha flavors. Finishes earthy and a touch herbal. Nice as lighter-framed Rioja goes.
This ripe, smooth and juicy wine shows plenty of Malbec tannins as well as fresh berry flavors. Still young, it has a bright character that will certainly calm down and show its more structured side. Drink from 2016.
This is a cool, poised, fresh wine with deliciously pure, green fruit flavors. There are citrus flavors and plenty of acidity, but the final taste is soft and rich.
This is a big, bold blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Petite Sirah and 15% Zinfandel that persists in thick, dense tannin and leather and tobacco notes. Full of juicy black fruit and subtle cinnamon and pepper, it finishes clean.
An elegant, memorable wine with balance and poise. The nose offers red berry, warming spice and a touch of smoke, while on the palate, smooth, dark berry and spice flavors are harmonious and rich. The wine can age but is good now. Pair with a succulent duck dish or pate and cheeses.

A fruity Cahors, showing off black berry fruits and light acidity within an easy structure. The style is bright and ready to drink.
A good, ripely extracted Cabernet, and while it's a little one-dimensional, it has enough heft to accompany a good steak. Shows tannic flavors of blackberries, black currants and dark chocolate. Drink now.
Smells raw and stemmy, with green wood aromas.  In the mouth, it;s dry, as you'd expect.  Not much flavor, for those accustomed to ripe fruit.  It' a structural wine, meant to go with food, and could be nice with, say, a lamb curry, which would bring out the hidden sweetness.  If you're careful about pairing, it's a nice wine.  A Rhone blend of Carignane, Grenahe, Mourvedre and Syrah.
Blending 75% Cabernet Franc with 25% Merlot, this wine is mildly aromatic on the nose, showing red cherry, spice and violet. While the palate is medium in weight, a string of acidity cuts short the blackberry and cherry flavors. Grainy tannins build on the finish, with a shock of cranberry and vanilla marking the close.
Fresh red apples and juicy, ripe pears beckon on the nose at first, then peachiness shines through. On the palate it's even riper with a satisfying heart of fresh and baked apples and a rounded, almost bouncy structure that has some thing celebratory and joyous about it, with lots of lively freshness, zip and length.

Drink 2018–2023.

Coming from a site best known for its Syrah, this wine brings high-toned aromas of violets, herb and dark fruit. The black-fruit flavors are rich yet supple, with fine-grained but occasionally toothy tannins providing support. Mocha flavors linger on the finish. It's a bit oak heavy but by and large carries it.
Cheesy aromas of leather, licorice and black fruits filter into a jagged, fiercely tannic palate. Flavors of tea, black plum, stewed berry and herbs finish with a big residual tannic bite.
Simple and delicious, this vibrant, mouthwatering red doles out fleshy black cherry, crushed blueberry, ground pepper and clove alongside polished tannins. An almond note graces the finish. This makes a fantastic everyday wine.
Kind of on the light side, but it shows the Highlands character of crispness, elegance, dryness and varietal purity. With its thinned-down cherry, cola and pomegranate flavors, it lets you put a Morgan Pinot Noir on your table for less than any of its other bottlings.
Golden in color, this has bready baked-apple aromas. It feels plump and soft for a brut nature, with a maderized quality to the palate. It tastes extremely dry, like seltzer water blended with citrus, almond and butterscotch. It continues on the same flavor plane throughout the finish.
Though this is just the first vintage from the estate vineyard's Viognier grapes, it is immensely satisfying, with juicy, rich, dense flavors of limoncello and tropical fruits. Peach and papaya, mango and pineapple, all sharply defined by just enough tangy acid.
An ancient variety now seen rarely, this Códega do Larinho has produced a wine that has a steely texture and tangy citrus flavors. It is bright with acidity, lime and grapefruit fruits and so crisp. It is ready to drink.
Faiveley's general firm style of red wine is a great advantage in this simple Burgundy. This wine has structure, red berry acidity, ripe tannins and a lively, vivid flavor. To finish, there is plenty of ripe acidity.
From the family's estate holdings in the Saar, this is a steely, minerally wine, but the ripeness of the vintage has given it a saber's heft rather than the more typical rapier-like weight. A bit austere, but long, dry and minerally on the finish.
Peppery spice and a nose of violets and roses mark the entry and midpalate of this wine, priced moderately for the appellation. Layered, with a twinge of yeasty baked bread, it has a strong personality, stemmy and feral, with a lasting linger of grenadine.
A creamy but not mushy mouthfeel and nicely defined flavors mark this friendly, easy-to-enjoy bottling. It's mainstream, with mild tropical fruit and citrus aromas and flavors, but it has a bit more class than many similar wines, especially with its even feel and long finish. Best Buy.
Taut and mineral, this is a chewy wine, with a dense texture of green apple skins. It has an almost steely character while still showing richness.
Lychee and tropical fruit aromas are heavy and rubbery. Ditto the palate, which weighs in soft. Generic tropical flavors of lychee and papaya are mellow at best and finish with bitterness.
Fruity and juicy in blackberry and black cherry, this mountain-grown Zin has soft, integrated tannins and a backbone of spiciness, white pepper mostly, and dark black licorice, that winds its way through the finish.
Sanguine in cranberry, red plum and dark cherry, this wine offers sizable tannin and oak around more savory elements of tobacco and black tea, an introduction of soy on the full-bodied finish.
Lime zest and guava notes make for a tropical nose. The palate adds greener tints of grass and midpalate texture that combines a creamy core with spiky freshness. The concentrated core results in a resonant, clean finish. Not your usual Sauvignon Blanc but one worth trying.
Much like the 2006, this is an excellent effort, combining ripe melon and fig flavors with leafy notes of fresh garden herbs and crisp citrus. It's a touch viscous on the palate, finishing with superb length and freshness. Drink now.

Scents of wine-soaked prunes and Armagnac are tempting on this Merlot blend. Soft tannins and a crisp acidity frame a palate full of concentrated black cherry fruit flecked with tobacco and dried herbs.
Here's an easygoing rosato that offers aromas of red berry and a hint of Mediterranean herb that carry over to the simple palate. A touch of white pepper marks the finish.
There's lots of acidity in this young wine, which gives it a slightly minty, prickly feeling that actually adds to its food-friendliness. With pineapple, green apple, spice and smoky oak flavors, it finishes thoroughly dry. Easy to find, with 30,000 case production.
High alcohol gives this Zin heat and also a glycerine sweetness. Residual sugar may contribute to the sweet taste. The flavors are of raspberries, cherries and caramelized oak.
Vanilla, clove, allspice, dried ginger and soy are laced into black-plum sauce on the nose of this densely layered wine. The palate is even-handed, with tight boysenberry spiced up by caramel and bitter espresso notes.
Lambrusco I Quercioli opens with a dark ruby color and pink foam that fizzes when the wine is poured into the glass. This is a dry bubbly red wine that shows the perky effervescence and acidity to pair with buttery pasta or cheesy tortellini dishes.
There is nothing wimpy about this 100% pure Merlot. The firm core of tart berry and currant adds iron and clove highlights through a concentrated midpalate; the finish is a bit rough and hints at green tannins.
Notes of Turkish delight and peach immediately signal opulence. The palate follows up with distinct sweetness that underlines the rich rose and peach flavors even more. There is an edge of freshness, but only just. Yet the palate is intense and pervaded by peach. Whether this is about intensity or sweetness will depend entirely on the food it is paired with.
Pure Alicante Bouschet is rare in the cooler Lisboa region, but this wine certainly reveals much of the richness and intense fruit that makes this grape so popular among producers. It is a rich wine, with structure as well as fruit, that is ready to drink now.
Way too hot and high in alcohol. This wine cannot handle the 16%; the fruit isn't here, except for some raisins, leaving behind pure heat.
Despite its youth, this is a soft, round, totally accessible wine with pretty flavors of sassafras, pie cherries and cooked plums. It skirts close to an impression of jam, and almost begs for near-term consumption. Don't hold back.
New leather, black cherry, underbrush, sweet baking spice and a whiff of white pepper are just some of the aromas you'll discover on this stunning red. The structured, delicious palate doles out mature black cherry, raspberry, licorice, Mediterranean herb and a note of exotic spice alongside a backbone of polished, refined tannins. It already seamlessly combines power and finesse but will continue to develop complexity over the next decade. Drink 2018–2028.
One year's lees aging has softened this wine and given it great richness. It is a rounded and opulent wine, deliciously ripe and full of bold, mouth-filling fruit.
This is thin and uninspiring, but it's dry, with watery berry and spice flavors.
Begins with smoky bacon aromas that are followed by ripe black cherry and blackberry. Very plump and earthy, with a flush mouthfeel and lively acidity. Severely oaked, but that wood is of quality, so it yields vanilla and pepper rather than resin or sawdust. A blend of 85% Malbec and 15% Cabernet.
La Gerla offers a spectacular Brunello that hits all the right marks in terms of intensity, beauty and staying power. This is an opulent and rich wine with plump blueberry flavors followed by chocolate fudge and sweet exotic spice. You can either cellar it or enjoy it within the next few years.
Nicely dry and crisp in acidity, with the slightly vegetal, green bean taste of Chenin Blanc enriched with Viognier's flowers and tropical fruits. Good as a cocktail sipper or with Asian fare.
Toasted nut and bread crust aromas carry over to the bright palate along with mature apple, strawberry, citrus and a note of dried herb. Soft small bubbles lend elegance while fresh acidity lifts the finish.
Lightly wood aged, this wine is soft while still keeping some fruitiness. Spice and touches of toast are still integrating with the apple and lime flavors. The tangy, zesty aftertaste needs to calm down. Drink from late 2016.
This would be easy to mistake for Grenache—it's ruby-colored, cranberry-flavored, with hints of strawberry and licorice. Clean, crisp and noticeably acidic, it would be most enjoyable with a richly sauced breast of duck.
The American oak aging (80%) plays a significant role here but not in a bad way. There are notes of toast and Mounds bar with ripe flavors and a cranberry-filled finish.
Strange smelling, with aromas of exotic spices, blueberry and some other notes that don't come across that well. Feels solid and chunky, with herbal, sweet flavors that culminate in a dry, rubbery, herbal-tasting finish.
Very smooth in the nose, with fragrant, fresh aromas of flowers, lemon and lime. The dry citrusy palate and soft mouthfeel work perfectly together, while the finish is long, fruity and very pleasant. Quite a tasty sparkler with pure fruit. Its quality is obvious.
Chile's first high-profile, high-priced Carmenère has proven itself to be an excellent wine. The '05 has a slight herbal DNA, but there's plenty of oak, vanilla, raw fruit and texture to cover that up. On the palate, blackberry, prune and fine herbs comprise the flavors, while the finish turns thick and dense. With 8% Petit Verdot, Purple Angel continues to press the case for high-end Chilean Carmenère.
We'll call this a table wine, but you could just as easily consider it a dessert sipper. It's honey-sweet in orange and vanilla flavors, with a pleasant zippiness that's almost sparkling.
This is a rich and full-flavored wine that still has plenty of aging ahead of it. It has a very floral character that is followed by green fruit and spice, and sustained by a tight, steely texture. Drink from 2016.
This dry, floral, exotic Rioja is a different breed of cat. The bouquet is jammy and herbal, with flowery notes. In the mouth, abrasive tannins hold up a wayward frame, while blueberry, plum and floral flavors finish with prune and dried herb notes. Drink now.
A tropically oriented Chardonnay, this has aromatic hints of corn nuts and apricot fuzz, finishing with a taste of sour lemon.
Smells and tastes like a pleasing mix of white stone fruit, citrus and rainwater. Feels fresh on the palate, though not as concentrated as I would like. Imported by Pacific Wine Partners.
This wine is 100% Cabernet Franc coming from Dineen (75%) and Ciel du Cheval vineyards. Barnyard, cherry, pencil box and spice aromas are followed by lightly styled game, dried cherry and medicine cabinet flavors.
Baked, saucy and mildly burnt smelling, with a sweet, faux-chocolate edge to balance things out. The palate is bland and creamy, with milk chocolate, baked fruit and pepper flavors. Has thickness but is challenged in terms of taste and aromas.
Made with Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Sangiovese and a drop of Petit Verdot, this has aromas of stewed plum, exotic spice, raisin, purple flower and a balsamic note. The concentrated palate offers cassis, dried blackberry, oak-driven spice, bitter cocoa and espresso alongside close-grained tannins that leave a firm grippy finish.
90-92 Barrel sample. Firmly dry wine, solid with many firm, wood-derived tannins. It gives bitter coffee and cranberry juice flavors, but also manages to retain freshness.
Perfectly decent everyday red wine, chocolaty, soft and dryish, with pleasant pie filling flavors of cherries dusted with cinnamon and a dash of crème de cassis.
Softly tannic, rich and enormously enjoyable, this Rhône-style blend offers lush flavors of raspberries, cherries, milk chocolate, crispy bacon, black pepper and sandalwood. The alcohol is heady, but balanced with fine acidity. Drink over the next two years for freshness.
Hannah Vineyard is a select block at the highest point of Tualatin Estate. Distinctive with a streak of pine resin running through darker flavors of black raspberry, black cherry and clean earth, it finishes with a lick of black licorice.
Alluring, intense nose of honey, beeswax and hay. The palate continues along a mineral line, with flavors of wet gravel highlighted by crisp acidity. Graham cracker notes peek through on the dry finish. Drink up.
Savory, spicy aromas of leathery berry, oak and graphite set up a medium-full palate that's dense, blocky and burly. Dark, peppery flavors of plum and prune finish with a cool, herbal, minty sensation.
Rich spice and beautiful balsam notes of cherry cola and root beer set the stage for what is a compelling Chianti Classico with good intensity and staying power. The wine has a chewy, rich texture with long-lasting notes of bursting cherry.
Aromas recall white spring flower, citrus and a hint of herb. The fresh palate offers nectarine and lemon zest alongside brisk acidity that leaves a clean finish.
Light notes of firm cheese, brown mustard and toast confirm this wine's age. Following on the palate are watery fruit and herb flavors accented by soft acids and finishing with a toasty, herbal streak.
This starts light, with wild berry and bramble flavors, but it's nicely balanced and persists across the palate with pleasant milk chocolate flavors. Well integrated with good acids, this 100% varietal Merlot is pleasurable and easy drinking.
A fine Chardonnay for drinking now, this will satisfy for its creamy texture and tart flavors of buttered toast, oranges and pears.
A really nice Syrah, especially at this price. It's dry, softly tannic and enormously rich in blackberry and cherry-pie filling, red licorice, beef jerky, black pepper and sandalwood flavors. A real pleasure to drink now if you're looking for a medium-bodied red.
A lovely fresh blast of citrus foliage rises from the glass. The palate carries the same fragrant freshness but holds warmth and strength at its core, despite the dry taut body. This is the sunshine and the richness of 2015 captured with a light touch. The finish is dry and refreshing.
Pretty in violet and rose petals this is a lower-octane Pinot Noir for the winery. Exquisitely rendered in spicy dark cherry and soft, supple tannins, it hails from a cool, coastal vineyard site 1,000 feet atop Occidental Ridge, the coolest source of grapes for Davis.
Aged for five years on its lees before disgorgement, this prestige cuvée is ripe and beautifully mature. It has a rich feel, moving towards toastiness while retaining tangy citrus and white-fruit flavors. This generous wine is ready to drink.
This is made from a curious 70-20-10 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Teroldego (an indigenous grape of northern Italy). The results include black currant, lead pencil, green spice, natural rubber, smoked bacon and lingering blueberry. With its thick, chewy succulence, jackhammer tannins and amazing length, it will hold 20 years.
A blend of Sangiovese, 10% Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, this offers aromas that recall ripe plum, sun-baked earth and black pepper. The round, ripe palate doles out fleshy black cherry, cinnamon, mocha and a confectionary note alongside lithe tannins.
Earthy up front, with a heavy, mildly herbal set of berry aromas. The palate is juicy and fairly solid, with fresh red-berry flavors accented by a dose of creamy vanilla. Long on the finish for basic Merlot, with an herbal lasting impression.
Heavy and unfocused, with unconvincing flavors of carob and coconut running roughshod on the palate. A hulk that's out of joint.
Tart red cherry notes beckon on the nsoe and lead to a light, slender, translucent body of unpretentious fruit and freshness. This is the sort of easy-drinking, dry wines you absolutely must have in your picnic basket: uncomplicated fruit, freshness and joy.
Big, bold, wild and dark, with mild burnt aromas backed by broad blackberry and plum flavors. This represents the fruity, thick style of Syrah, with additional notes of black olive and savory meat pie. It's not flawless but its pounding fruit character will earn its share of fans.
Luminous and bright, this Greco di Tufo from the province of Avellino in Campania offers pristine aromas of pear, citrus, talcum powder, pineapple and white flowers. It has deep citrus flavors of grapefruit and lemon zest.
Overripe black berries, vanilla, leather and a touch of coconut lead the nose. The palate delvers fleshy black cherry layered with chocolate and a coffee note alongside evolved, rather tired tannins. It's not an ager so enjoy this soon.
Curry leaf, turmeric and milled white pepper appear first on the nose here and make this Sauvignon from southern Italy a natural companion to coconut Thai green curry with fresh basil and chopped eggplant. The wine is crisp, tonic, tight and slightly sweet on the finish.
Dark color and a severe tartness make this wine challenging on the palate. It's overripe in terms of tropical fruit and bogged down by a sourness that's hard to shake. Let it open and pair it with creamy foods like goat cheese to get it to behave.
A finely balanced wine, bringing together the new wood flavors with structured tropical fruits. Plangent acidity is the binding agent, giving an excitingly refreshing wine with a bright finish.
Elegant and detailed, this is a dry, racy wine with well-balanced flavors of lemon, lime, citrus and mineral. It's quite fresh and perfectly proportioned, with exceptional length. Delicious already, it can easily age until 2025 and probably well beyond.
Moderate white stone fruit aromas lead to greener flavors of asparagus,  edamame and gooseberry. This is a wine with a lot of kick, but finishes on the tangy side. Imported by Vineyard Brands.
This wine is ripe with generous strawberry flavors and perfumed acidity. A smoky edge accompanies tastes of red cherry. The wine is rounded and light with attractive final acidity.
The wine starts of with intriguing bacon and earth tones that are followed up by rich, ripe raspberry, black cherry, spice, licorice, herb and toast flavors. It's beautifully balanced, with supple tannins and a flashy, robust character that remains enticing and long at the end. Look for more of this varietal from Darioush as its Shiraz vineyards mature.
Good, everyday red for those who like their Zins briary, brambly and rustic. It's a soul food wine, whose berry-cherry flavors are just short of of raisiny. Not without its faults, but easy and gulpable.
Handley's Anderson Valley bottling is always bright in acids, which are so nice and clean in a Chardonnay as fruity and rich as this. The flavors are a complex melange of pineapples, peaches and pears.
Aromas of mature black fruit, tobacco and a hint of leather lead the nose on this structured blend of Sangiovese and 15% Alicante Bouschet, Merlot and Cabernet. The palate delivers dried cherry, licorice and espresso alongside tightly knit, chewy tannins.
Exceptionally rich and sensual, this single-vineyard beauty has finely ground, dusty tannins. The fruit veers toward sour cherry candy, with a jacket of sweet, toasty oak. Drink now–2016.
Estate-grown from one of the family's oldest Zin blocks, this wine is hugely toasty and oaky, with hits of bacon and dark coffee overshadowing an underlying layer of blackberry flavor.
While smoke and herb aromas suggest an savory tone, the palate of this shimmering wine is unctuous with sweet peach and hibiscus nectar. High-toned acidity rouses the midpalate, leading to a finish that's fresh and floral.
Sleek and vibrant, this fresh but substantive and potentially long-lived wine offers a lip-smacking citrus flavor and crisp apple tang, along with mild vanilla accents and a luxurious, layered texture. Little oak flavor shows through, so you taste the essence of Chardonnay grapes in an elegant form. It will be best after 2019.
Heavy and high-voltage, with a strong whiff of green bean to the nose. Flavors of raisin, raspberry and green pepper combine to create a palate that has its high moments as well as its faults. Tight on the finish, with lots of tobacco and bell pepper.
The best La Bernardine I can recall, this is a wonderfully full-bodied yet elegant rendering of Châteauneuf-du-Pape. Garrigue and floral notes make a healthy impression on the nose, while the expansive herb and black cherry flavors linger on the silky finish. Drink now–2025.
Robert Young is one of Alexander Valley's greatest wineries. After others achieved success with their Merlot grapes, they started making their own wine, and consumers are the beneficiaries. Truly soft and voluptuous, yet richly structured, the wine is totally dry, with a dried herb edge to the cherry flavors. The complexity is enormous, but somehow the wine remains delicate and elegant.
Distinctive in aroma and flavor profile, this medium-bodied red smells like cedar, tobacco and black pepper. A blend of Mourvèdre, Montepulciano and Barbera, it boasts an earthy personality that is appealing and unique. Fifteen percent of the proceeds from the sale of this wine are contributed to the Return To Freedom Wild Horse Sanctuary.
This is an intriguing wine, with its perfumed aromas of wild flower and cinnamon. The acidity cuts through the delicious apple flavor, and the finish has a great crisp feel. Screwcap.
A smooth and ripe blend of Viosinho, Rabigato and Gouvelo, the wine has attractive, smooth apple and pear flavors as well as tangy acidity. With its light touch of acidity at the end, the wine is delicious and ready to drink.
This is a much more oaky version of the winery's Game Ranch regular bottling, which was released two years ago. The original release was very ripe in fruit but very tannic. This one's the same, but plastered with new oak.
Strikes a middle-of-the-road pose, combining a nice apple and watermelon fruitiness with a little softness, a little sweetness and enough acidity to make it balanced. It's an easy wine to like and to pair with casual foods.
This might be one of the best values on the market, given the quality. Equal parts pretty and funky, it's a tightly wound, savory, fruity wine that's elegant and compelling. The tannins and oak are lightly imprinted around strawberry-rhubarb and fresh-cut rose, and the texture seductively silky. This is a delicious treat of a wine that should also age.
98-100 Barrel sample. A superb wine, with the purest fruit, great freshness and ripeness. It is certainly structured with dry tannins, but the blackcurrant freshness is all there. The wine has a great limpid, flowing feel, lbut also power.
Delicate tones of stone fruit, lime, talc power and honeydew melon mark the bouquet. It's crisp on the palate, with a touch of wild salvia on the finish.
Quinta da Lapa has plantings of the rare Tamarez grapes that have gone into the blend of this wine along with Arinto. It is perfumed, ripe and fruity with a touch of spice and citrus and yellow fruit flavors. Drink now.
Low intensity fruit and floral aromas are hidden in the bouquet, with minor suggestions of strawberry hull and crushed carnation to be found only upon deep nosing. Light and easy in the mouth with a short but clean finish.
As sweet as a dessert wine. Tastes like sugared pineapple, apricot and orange juice. Fine in cleansing acidity, but it's not really a dry table wine.
A gorgeous wine, dry and complex, whose natural fruit richness and acidity have been accented by full-bore Burgundian treatment of sur lies and oak barrel aging. It's basically a Sauvignon Blanc, with citrus flavors and a mouthwatering green fruit taste that suggests limes and kiwis. Combines a bracing quality with richness, and the result is compelling.
Aromas of cough syrup, bittersweet chocolate, anise and dark fruit lead to full-bodied sweet-cherry flavors. Layers of firm, dry tannins provide the frame.
This is a very dry, acidic wine. It's rather austere, not showing much richness now. With a minerally tang, It's more like a French Chablis than an opulent California Chardonnay. Give it credit for elegance and finesse.
This Merlot opens with savory aromas of spice and cured meat, followed by notes of blackberry preserves and black currant. It shows some secondary aromas of leather and pipe tobacco, plus lingering tones of rum cake, licorice and tar. There's a fresh, almost menthol-like quality to the palate, which offers tight, polished tannins and long savory flavors.
The winery has done a good job at their Meritage in the past. This vintage is something of a letdown. The wine suffers from a tart, acidic dryness that lacks generosity of fruit. Yet it retains elegance and balance. Drink now.
Deeply layered and pure on the nose, with tar, cola and toasty oak aromas, this feels deep, full and choppy, with tough tannins and seriously dark flavors of blackened spice, berry and bitter chocolate. It's very long on the finish, which has a tough feel but is generous and loaded with power. Drink 2013–2018; 275 cases made.
Unlike most of the Torbreck wines, this is single-vineyard Shiraz, cofermented with a small proportion of Viognier, then aged in barrels previously used for RunRig. Hints of apricot and bacon fat impart beautiful nuance to the blackberry fruit. This is slightly firmer than Torbreck's other reds, worth cellaring for five years or so, then drinking over the next 15.
A bit too high in alcohol, which gives it a sweet, glyceriney headiness, but fine with barbecue. Shows flavors of grilled blackberries, plumped raisins and tart mulberries.
Three years running and this wine has been impressive since its debut in 2006. The nose is dark and sweet, maybe a touch pasty, but loaded with black fruit aromas. The palate is staunch and secure, with pronounced but proper acidity leading to bright, fresh blackberry and cassis flavors. Toasty and chocolaty on the finish, and impressive as a whole. Drink now through 2011.
From a section of the producer's Quail Hill Vineyard, this wine sings with smoky sage and forest floor notes, its tingling acidity emphasizing freshness. Its backbone of thick tannins offers strength and power, contrasting more delicate layers of blueberry flavor.
Faint notes of strawberry rise from the glass; on the palate they become more subdued and meld into fresh, citrusy notes of grapefruit. The combination of fine fizz, grown-up dryness and spiky citrus is absolutely convincing, even mouth-watering.
Fragrant and expressive, it's got a wonderful lift to the plummy fruit which is spiced up with clove and gamy scents of smoked and cured meats. This is not your typical jammy, fruit-driven Syrah; it's much tighter and more Rhône-like, with fine natural acids and aging potential of up to a decade.
Nose is an unusual mix of butter, bacon and a hint of greenness that disappears after a few minutes in the glass. Its mouthfeel is minerally, with warm honey and pear skin flavors, and just a hint of herb. A very good wine, but not as good as it has been in recent vintages.
Darker and a touch more stewy than the winery's less pricey old-vines effort. Airing loosens it up, but throughout it's a big, stewy wine with extracted blackberry and coffee cake flavors. The finish is equally on the rich side, with swirling toffee and coffee afternotes. It's a big wine with heft but also some chunkiness.
The latest Métier is 100% Viognier, all from Ciel du Cheval on Red Mountain. The lack of Roussanne in the blend takes away some subtle level of complexity, and this wine, though ripe and extracted and quite seductive, seems a bit one-dimensional. It's a really, really good dimension however, with lush peachy fruit and generous dollops of vanilla cracker and toast.
Medium purple in color, faint blueberry juice notes mark the nose. While the palate shows a bit more intensity in ripe fruit nature, it's a bit flabby in feel.
This is a powerfully built Malbec with intense aromas of mint, medicine and blackberry. It feels thick and pure, with a chewy texture and medicinal flavors of berry, vanilla and spice. The flavors veer toward char, pepper and darkness on the finish.
Light aromas suggest butterscotch and baked apple, and indeed this is a soft SB with creamy, plump flavors of peach, melon and sugar. Sweet on the finish, and then it falls off the cliff before winding up a little mealy and bitter.
With lilting lemon, grapefruit and pretty pineapple aromas and flavors, this is a good example of Lake County Sauvignon Blanc. It's light and bright, and the flavors on the finish veer into equally pleasing peach and apricot notes, with a touch of almond.
Aromatically reserved for a dessert wine, with apricot and pear. It's lusciously sweet, with abundant stone fruit flavors but could use a bit more concentration and acidity to hold it together.
This is a recommended wine for those who love classic expressions of Amarone. The wine's intensity is fueled by aromas of cherry, apple, spice and chocolate and it really comes alive in the mouth thanks to a long, fresh trail of cola and dried herbs.
A narrow bouquet offers mostly citrus peel. The palate is fairly plump in feel, with pithy, slightly bitter flavors of peach and tropical fruits. Mild bitterness on the finish keeps a lid on overall quality.
A scent of stewed legumes weaves through the aromas of tobacco, cassis, leather and caramelized sugar. It's medium bodied, with palate-clenching tannins, but the wild strawberry note on the finish outlasts the tannic structure.
This wine is lightly layered and linear, with stony green apple notes over a backdrop of toasted brioche.
Kudos to Jorian Hill for crafting a rosé that's truly dry. It's a sophisticated, elegant blush wine with subtle raspberry, herb, rose petal, spice and mineral flavors, finished with a wonderfully clean scour of acidity. This Provençal blend of Syrah, Grenache and Mourvèdre is one of the best rosés of the yearn and is reasonably priced.
Calling on the inspiration or mysticism of the figure 7, grower Didier Pelvillain has introduced this version, one in a range of three. This wine is balanced between juicy acidity and firm, dark tannins. The black plum fruit flavors are still in the background as it develops. Give this wine time to fill out and start drinking from 2018.
A blend of 70% Clairette, 15% Sémillon and 15% Rolle, this is a slightly nutty, almondy white with touches of honeyed richness and apricot. Turns a bit astringent on the finish.
The slightest notions of dark, bitter honey hover above ripe, red-apple fruit, along with spice, chalk and lanolin, announcing a wine that is already evolving. The dry palate highlights all these flavors in turn, lit up by freshness and held by a taut, bright structure. This is a beautiful, statuesque wine full of complex, chalky notes. The absolutely clean finish is long and a total apple-scented joy.Drink 2016–2025.
Aged only in stainless steel, Usignolo is a no-fuss expression of Nebbiolo that presents direct and friendly aromas of small berry fruit and blue flowers without the aged complexity of Barbaresco or Barolo. This would drink well with pizza or informal pasta dishes.
The cool, compromising 2008 vintage conditions are reflected here; the wine is jammy but a little green on the nose and at its core. The feel is heavy, lactic and rich, while the flavors are narrow and jammy, with prune, blackberry and grassy mint. There's both overripe and underripe notes on this high-end blend of 70% Malbec and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon.
Aromas recall jasmine, botrytis and tangerine. It drinks medium sweet with honeyed fruit flavors and a clipped finish.
Aromas that recall nail varnish eventually fade to reveal raisin, prune, chocolate and coffee notes that carry over to the palate along with plum, toasted oak and vanilla.
A sharp, almost flinty wine, with firm, tart fruit and a tight finish.
A troubled Zinfandel, the winery's least successful in years. It has some vegetal notes as well as fruity raspberry jam. That green note is especially noticeable in the finish. Ready to drink now.
A rather dull nose does not want to reveal much. The palate counters this with freshness and a rosehip tartness that has some bitter-edged redcurrant charm. This is fresh and easy and would also work as a chilled red.
Coffee, chocolate, plum and spicy clove add highlights to a dark, textured wine rich with sour chocolate, tar and black cherry. The mouthfeel is creamy, supple, juicy and concentrated with menthol freshness on the finish. Imported by Michael Skurnik Wines.
Richness and near-sweetness are the main personality traits of this full-bodied and quite viscous wine. With oodles of ripe pear, peach and vanilla flavors, it should be great with aged cheeses and fruit desserts.
90-92. Barrel sample. Initially, this wine shows spice and round fruit notes, followed by a tannic structure. The wine has weight, with a feeling of balanced wood and plenty of juicy flavors on the finish.
Riper notes of pink grapefruit and tangerine distinguish this dry Riesling from Georg Albrecht Schneider's other 2014 wines. The palate is cutting and crisp, showcasing tart limes and gooseberries against a blossomy finish. Drink now.
Briny grassy aromas of apple and citrus are yeasty as well. This Chardonnay-Pinot Noir blend is foamy and active, while flavors run towards slightly bitter and yeasty, with fruit hard to find. A similar finish renders this good but with issues.
Smells very bright, with alluring lemon, cocoa and grass aromas. The flavors veer to citrus fruits, apricots and sweet white chocolate, and linger through the longish finish. Yet it's basically a dry wine.
Golden-honey and pear flavors combine effortlessly in this lovely wine from the famous vineyard, which neighbors this producer along the appellation's Westside Road. Moderate acidity freshens a bold full-bodied approach defined by its backbone of smooth integrated oak.
The nose smells minty and capped with rubbery, blackened aromas. It feels tangy and tannic, with medicinal flavors of berry and resiny oak. It's powerful but rough.
The heatwave summer of 2003 gave the right conditions for producing a Vintage Port. Many seemed drinkable younger than usual for this style of wine, and this is totally open, fruity, soft and ready to drink. It's a rich, sweet style, very perfumed and ripe.
While fairly subdued on the nose, this dry, rather uncharacteristic Gewürztraminer is refreshingly quaffable, with an abundance of fresh apple and fig flavors marked by snappy tangerine acidity.
This grand estate was once a hunting ground for an even grander nearby chateau. The cru wine that's now produced here is crisp and fruity, streaked through with acidity and red currants. It has a touch of tannin as well as minerality. Drink from late 2017.
A consistent performer, the rosé under the Commanderie de la Bargemone label is a fresh, medium-bodied wine that features enticing aromas of white chocolate and cherries. Modest cherry flavors finish crisp and citrusy, giving this wine excellent refreshment value.
Winemaker: John Loubser. A blend of 62% Chardonnay and 38% Pinot Noir, this MCC is bright and lively, with forward scents of toasted apple, fresh hay, spiced orange and a touch of honeycomb. The creamy and full-bodied palate is balanced by bright acidity and brisk effervescence, with a final note of toasted brioche that lingers on the close. You can enjoy it's youthful vibrancy now, but it should age well through 2021.
This opens with aromas of blue flower, ripe woodland berry and a whiff of pressed powder. The robust palate doles out juicy black cherry, mature plum, licorice and savory herb alongside firm, velvety tannins. It's concentrated and already accessible but will offer drinking pleasure for the next several years. Drink through 2021.
Zippy white grapefruit and lemon juxtapose more savory tones of crushed mineral, pressed apple and pear in this off-dry Riesling. The palate is sprightly and bright with a clean, moderately persistent finish. Drink now through 2019.
Reedy weedy aromas include notes of motor oil and leafy berry fruits. This tastes as weedy as it smells, with underripe herbal berry flavors that never shed an overriding green essence.
Mostly Malbec and Syrah topped off with Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, it's subtle with notes of freshly hewn wood, plum, cinnamon, and cherry pie. The palate's soft cherry flavors are juxtaposed against oak spices but the wood ultimately wins.
Attractive white Bordeaux blend, much better than the red from the same estate. It has a delicious ripe fruit character with pineapple, lime and kiwi flavors and final acidity.
A classic Cab in the Santa Cruz Mountains style, this savory bottling shows black pepper, charcoal and grilled blueberries on the nose along with tons of dried herbs. Blackberry, anise, dill, cedar and pencil lead show on the sip, where intriguing depth and a silky texture combine.
Try as I might, I haven't been able to jump on board this wine since it debuted three harvests ago. The nose is minerally but short on fruit, which pretty much describes the wine. It's lemony, sharp-edged and lean, with a minerally foundation and modest fruit character. What it lacks is a middle tier or two.
Bright raspberry and fresh-pressed bramble make for a nicely snappy nose that also conveys a touch of rust, graphite and earthiness. Tart cranberry and plum skin mesh into mineral tones of slate and pencil lead, all lifted by bay leaf and dried sage. It needs time to reach full potential.
Winemaker Francisco Olazabal, from Quinta do Vale Meão is behind this ripe, fruity and stylishly fresh wine. It's a classic blend of Douro grapes with the addition of Sousão (apparent from the dark color and high acidity). It's a wine that would be worth aging a few months, so wait until late 2016 to drink.
Slightly bruised apple on nose and palate also becomes apparent on the textured, balanced palate of this wine that aligns citric freshness with more mellow and sonorous tones of ripeness. The finish is dry and whistle-clean.
Notable for its firm minerality and acidity and distinguished mouthfeel. Could be a little richer, but offers intricate raspberry, sour cherry candy, blueberry, cola and sandalwood flavors. Might blossom over the next few years. Drink now–2013.
Jammy but generic berry fruit aromas are crowded by lactic, pasty oak scents and vanilla. The wine is hard as cement in the mouth, with jagged tannins. Flavors of sun-baked raisin and plum fold in chocolate and rubbery notes on a grabby finish that includes residual resiny oak. This could use more time; try after 2016.
Initially dominated by tannins, this wine is now evolving to show a softer, easier side. With sweet fruit and a delicious, refreshing juicy black currant acidity, the tannins are now the base of an approachable wine, offering considerable pleasure.
Ironstone's track record for this pretty dessert wine continues with the '07. It's off-dry, with residual sugar just under 2%, and polished flavors of pineapples, oranges, marzipan, honey and vanilla. High acidity adds the perfect touch of crispness.
A soft wine, it has a rounded, open texture and offers red fruits, an attractively aromatic character and fresh acidity at the end.
Although you might encounter some initial sulfur, this wine later portrays yellow rose, peach, almond, cut grass and honey. It doesn't have huge flavor intensity but just enough to keep your attention.
92-94 Barrel sample. Bright, crisp wine, lots of vivacious herbal and lemon characters. Very fresh, with delicious apple skin texture.
Tar and black fruit emerge from the shadows of big tannins that pucker on the palate, begging for more time to soften. Robust and full bodied with a warm ripeness, it finishes flat.
Initially there is too much burnt wood flavor in this wine. It's only slowly that the red fruits begin to show, leaving a fresh, if lightweight character before attractive final acidity.
The Grand Cru of Quarts de Chaume juts out over the Layon Valley, with its autumn mists, resulting in the best conditions for noble rot. This luscious wine, gold in color, is so rich, so intense as to be almost overwhelming. It is so young still all rich fruit, peaches, apricots with a touch of ginger. The wine, with its background of considerable acidity, will develop slowly; drink from 2020.
The faintest hint of pineapple signals ripe fruit on the nose. Soft but fresh, the palate delivers uncomplicated, unoaked and simple drinking pleasure with a seam of fresh acidity.
This wine comes off as quite green, with notes of assorted garden herbs, freshly cut bell pepper and moist soil. The black-fruit flavors are plush in feel, showing concentration and richness and a pleasing feel. If you can get around the overt greenness—and there's plenty of it—there are things to enjoy.
Showing the ripe 2015 vintage, this is a soft rounded wine. It has attractive acidity to lift the ripe yellow fruit and add a shot of citrus. The wine needs another few months to settle in, so wait until summer 2017.
Aromas of baked black fruit, rubber and herb set up an edgy, zesty palate with a buttery oak flavor running side by side with roasted berry and cassis. Short, oaky and basic on the finish, with drying tannins.
This is pure Petit Verdot, substantial and muscular. Scents of violets and purple fruits bring extra nuances of mushroom and moist earth. There is a hint of animal, and a tight core of purple fruits. Tannins are supple and well-managed.
This leads with light baking spice and apple pie aromas. The palate is broad, with abundant vanilla flavors that suggest strong oak influence.
This cuvée reflects the lean vintage with modest alcohol and slightly dilute fruit flavors. Pretty aromatics suggest rosewater and sandalwood, and the wine fades gracefully with plum and cherry fruit.
Sweet, but not very, and lacks the rich opulence you want in a dessert red wine. Shows plenty of raspberry and cherry flavor, but would benefit from greater intensity and sweetness.
Mazzocco's Zins are dependably superripe and high in alcohol. This '07 is a big, strong wine, offering flavors of blackberry and blueberry jam, spread onto buttered white toast and sprinkled with anisette. It's delicious and heady.
This low-sizzle Chardonnay opens with little to nothing in the way of fruit aromas. The palate is chunky, with squash and bready flavors. A lightly vegetal, bitter finish is plump but low on intensity.
This is a pure expression of Cabernet Sauvignon that has been sweetened and softened by the warm Sardinian sunshine. The wine is elegant and fine with aromas of spice, blackberry and tobacco. The mouthfeel is firm but also smooth.
The grapes for hail from both Carneros and Oak Knoll and have undergone both barrel and stainless steel fermentation. The result is a medium-weight to fuller-style of clean, crisp lemon and pear flavors, a swirl of tropical vanilla on the finish.
Artadi's top wine is dynamite in a bottle. Ripe, saturated, oaky aromas of blackberry, leather, blueberry pie and aged cheese are incredibly potent and alluring. This is huge in the mouth, with lemony oak and broad tannins that don't grind. Intense blackberry, coffee, toast and smoky flavors finish a mile deep, with all sorts of textural grab and character. Best from 2016 through 2026.
Ribolla Gialla is a grape with natural density and thickness and those qualities play a big role in shaping this unique sparkling wine from northeast Italy. You'll recognize aromas of stone fruit, melon and honey with creamy butter on the close.
Roasted cashew or almond butter elements give richness to the aromas, while the medium-bodied palate features crisp flavors of apple, pear and lime, framed by subtle nut and spice shadings. Focused and citrusy on the finish. Certified organic; 56 cases imported.
Roughly equal percentages of Gewürztraminer, Pinot Blanc, Riesling and Pinot Gris (with a splash of Muscat) create a wine that transcends the mutt wine moniker and belongs in a category all its own. Just slightly off dry, it's like taking a bite out of a just-picked pear-apple (if such a thing existed). This crunchy luscious white wine is juicy and alive with flavor. Don't wait—drink it now for a big burst of summer no matter how cold it may be outside.
A nice interpretation of Grenache Blanc. Blended with a drop of Viognier, it shows notes of orange and peach jam, honey, vanilla and toasty oak. The alcohol level is high. Drink up.
Still young, the wood-aging flavors show strongly in the toast and spice character of this wine. The black fruits are developing and will shortly balance out with the wood. Already the aftertaste is fruity and juicy. Drink this wine from late 2017.
Initial smoked meat and pickle aromas yield more of a deli sandwich nose than Tuscan wine, but with airing it settles to yield black cherry and plum. Those fruit flavors tay firm on the palate, which has a hard, tannic feel. Not that lush; more of a cheek blaster than anything.
This bottling has been variable over the years, but with the '06, Vina Robles seizes full command of Petite Sirah. Shows a classically thick, full-bodied texture, with dark currant, plum and licorice flavors edged with baker's chocolate. Fully dry, it's marvelous now with tri-tip, and should age for many years.
A big, burly Chablis, beautifully ripe, exhibiting powerful fruits overlaying a core of citrus and apple skin texture. The wine is open, rich, with an enticing juicy character, finished with bright, ripe acidity.
There is a strong pithy character to the nose of this wine, with aromas of Meyer lemon peel, grapefruit rind, Brie cheese wash, yogurt and wet rock. The palate is really tightly wound and also full of that tight pith character, with ethereal and wispy flavors of clean smoke, chalk and ash. The acidity is soft but penetrating.
Gavin Chanin has managed to make an Old World-styled wine with this bottling. More delicate than its boisterous Central Coast neighbors, it has an elegance that will appeal to Burgundy nuts. Pepper, pomegranate, cranberry and olive aromas lead into an extremely light palate of candied raspberry, red plum and uncrushed peppercorn flavors.
A combination of 76% Zinfandel and 24% Petite Sirah, this vineyard's lineage traces back in stages. The core six acres of Zinfandel was planted before 1892, the other acreage much more recently. Still, the wine retains an old soul of leather, tobacco and baking spice, wrapped around a ham-fisted swath of toasted oak.
91-93. Barrel sample. An attractive and fruity wine that offers soft, cushioned tannins, along with ripe, easy fruit.
Wet stone and lemon set the tone when it comes to scent. The palate falls in with these themes and presents precision and poise; the razor-sharp freshness of lemon zest is both brightening and deliciously bracing. This is a svelte but concentrated wine of great purity that has not really come into its own yet. It is perfumed now but one cannot help but suspect much more development of aroma in the future. All the potential, concentration and balance is there. The finish is dry and lemony. Drink 2017–2030.
Flavors of bitter extraction spoil this wine, giving an unnecessarily hard character and masking the fruit. It probably will not soften much. The blend is 79% Merlot, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon and 1% Cabernet Franc. Produced by Alliance Bourg.
Better known for its red wines, Ladoix's whites are a rarity. This wine is made from fruit sourced from vines that are close to the Corton hill. It is steely, minerally and crisp, with a wood-influenced character. With its structure, this needs at least three years of aging.
89-91. Barrel sample. While there is 100% new wood, the weight of fruit in this expression is sufficient to power through. It will be an impressive wine.
Oak aging gives this wine weight and richness, but detracts from the natural herbaceous fruitiness. The palate is spicy and peppery. Screwcap.
Three Rivers makes only a limited amount of this interesting Cab Franc. The fruit is pure blueberry, the tannins just ripe enough, the oak restrained. In this excellent vintage it shows a little extra complexity and depth, and seems like a good cellar candidate for the next decade or so.
Divinus is a superrich and concentrated Aglianico from Basilicata that needs a few more years of cellar aging in order to soften those firm tannins. Even at this young age, it shows impressive aromas of smoke, ash, black fruit, leather and spicy cigar tobacco.
This bears clean and crisp pear flavors, along with notes of jicama, green apple and lemon rind. It offers good detail in an elegant, unassuming style.
One sip is all it takes to be blown away by this Pinot's beauty. It's exquisitely crafted, a testament to both the vineyard and the winery's oenological talent. The palate is bright and tangy with acidity, and incredibly complex flavors of wild berries, mushrooms, balsam, cola and Asian spices. It's dramatic now, but will continue to improve for at least 15 years.
This is an awesome Cabernet. It's 100% varietal, with lots of French oak. It shows blackberry jam, black currant, chocolate and sweet oak flavors that are absolutely delicious. The wine is said to come from the esteemed Morisoli Vineyard, in Rutherford.
A pear-flavored wine, still fresh and young, showing its mineral texture, which is likely to soften. It's delicate, the lightest of the range of Rieslings from Rupert Summerer, the white fruits offering some sweetness as a balance to the bone-dry structure. Glass stopper.
Light and clean, which compared to other Argentine Pinot Grigios is not something to dismiss. Feels solid and punchy, with orange and mango flavors. Has nice overall clarity and balance, with a citrusy finish.
Baked and raisiny smelling, with kirsch. In a word, it's stewy. Ditto for the mouthfeel, which is chunky and heavy. Features thick black plum, herb and carob flavors and feels beefy on the finish.
Basic everyday Pinot Noir. It's dry, with simple cola and cherry flavors, and a grating acidity.
This may be a wrong estimate, but the wine tastes like it was made from younger vines in this large vineyard. It has that fresh, rude, jammy quality that trades complexity and ageworthiness for immediate appeal. Yet there's no denying the luxurious balance, and the deliciousness of the cherry, raspberry and cola flavors. Drink now.
Clean and decent, but hard to recommend. Bone dry, astringent and heavy in coffee and cherry flavors.
Focused and fragrant, this beautiful expression of the vintage opens with scents of violet, rose, perfumed berry and a hint of cake spice. The silky, linear palate doles out juicy red cherry, chopped aromatic herb, cinnamon and star anise alongside polished tannins and fresh acidity. Balanced and approachable, it will provide sheer drinking pleasure over the next several years or more. Drink 2017–2024.
This is a full-bodied, ripe, well-made and fruity wine, subdued and velvety on the palate in bright red fruit, leather, mint and cinnamon.
Each of the three varieties in the blend brings its own unique contribution. Zinfandel, the majority, gives spicy wild-berry flavors and robust body. Cabernet Sauvignon lends its firm tannins and deep black-currant flavors, while Merlot adds a soft, sensual mouthfeel. The resulting wine is easy to drink now with almost anything calling for a full-bodied dry red wine.
Surprisingly tropical, with concentrated notes of pineapple and guava, this dry, fruity Silvaner is elegantly structured, with zesty lime acidity. It's brisk and delicate on the palate, making it an excellent choice to pair with salads or vegetarian entrees.
A year after harvest, this ripe wine is showing the creamy side of Alvarinho. It hasn't lost its bright fruit, giving lemon as well as light toast from wood aging. Drink this wine now.
This Cabernet-based blend of all five Bordeaux varieties is the most inaccessible of Merryvale's '07 portfolio, and it consequently offers the least pleasure now. It's quite rich in blackberries and currants but the tannins are considerable, and 90% new oak buries the fruit under a cloak of char and wood tannins. Feels rustic, but obviously pedigreed and extremely ageable. The score could soar over the next 6–9 years as the wine develops in the bottle.
Dark gold in color, rich and on the dry side, this is a very fine wine from a family-owned quinta close to Régua. The long wood aging has introduced great concentration to the dried fruits and burnt toffee flavors. Marmalade and surprising freshness give the wine a lift. It is ready to drink now.
Don't be shocked by this wine's saucy, herbal nose, because that's what the grape variety gives. After you get used to the wine's herbal leanings, look for an oaky, herbal palate with vanilla and peppery flavors in front of a strong, scratchy finish.
Luscious aromas of lemon, sweet orange and honey are followed by a burst of honey, orange and spice in this indulgent dessert wine. A choice for fans of unctuous, sweet styles, the wine can be paired with cheeses, fresh fruit or sipped alone.
Chardonnay, Muscadet and something known as Pansa Blanca comprise this Catalonian oddball, which is so severely oaked that you have no idea what the grapes might actually taste like. No, it's not badly made, meaning there's mouthfeel, acidity and stages to the wine. But the aromas, flavors and overall package are weird and confusing.
A powerful, full-bodied and rich wine. Its tannins are already well balanced, layered within the dense black fruit. The wood aging brings hints of bitter chocolate and spice to go with its impressive fruit. This is a wine for aging over the next 4–5 years.
This top Cabernet bottling from Taylors has been a consistent favorite over the last few vintages, and the 2004 continues the string. It's complex, bringing scents of mint, coffee, cassis and tobacco all to the dance, and matching that complexity with weight and richness. The tannins are a bit astringent right now, so try it from 2010-2020.
Pear and apple aromas lead the way on this fresh, spritely wine that tingles the palate with a lightly spritzy feel. It doesn't quite stand up on its own but would work perfectly with baked fish.
The wine has a medicinal character with balsam and herbal flavors. It's rich, very textured, full of dry tannins as well as berry fruits. A strong mineral character shows the sense of terroir. Don't drink before 2017.
Aged in large casks, this Nebbiolo opens with classic varietal aromas of dried rose petal, underbrush, red berry and a balsamic note. The elegant palate delivers sour cherries, crushed raspberries, anise and a touch of baking spice alongside fine-grained tannins and bright acidity.
A blend of 50/50 Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine is balanced and firm. The solid, dry core is developing and integrating with the black currant fruits. It's concentrated and still young, with tannins that need to soften. Give this wine until 2017.
This modern white starts with aromas of peach, lemon zest and tropical fruit, with a rich and rounded fruit palate. Crisp acidity finishes the wine cleanly. A versatile wine with wide appeal.
Fans of dark oak will enjoy this Cab, which is big on char, green herb and dry tannins. Though there is a little plum and black cherry fruit underneath the oak, the midpalate still wants a little more oomph, and more fruit.
Big, smoky wood flavored wine. At this stage, it is all tannins, wood and dark spice. With the weight of fruit, though, it should develop into a solid and rich wine, layering its tannins with sweet black plum flavors.
As Brancott's top Pinot Noir offering, this is a bit of a disappointment. The fruit is jammy and berry-like, framed by ample vanilla and caramel. It's a satisfying, medium-bodied mouthful of oaked red, it just doesn't show the degree of savory complexity expected at this level.
Softly perfumed with scents of apple and orange skins, there's also a slightly waxy tone to this rich, semidry Ohio Riesling. Densely concentrated with flavors of apple compote and sunny tropical fruit, it finishes with a touch of sugar and musky potpourri.
Tingling acidity wraps around a core of pear and peach fruit in this well-integrated, layered and lush wine. The oak is quiet through the entry and midpalate, picking up power and weight on the finish. Lovely on its own, it's also a good choice for the table.
Firmly structured, this opens with scents of dark cherry marinated in spirits, baking spices, forest floor and a balsamic accent. The focused palate offers red berry, dried black cherry, clove, licorice and dried herbs alongside bracing but refined tannins and nervous acidity. Give this time to unwind and blossom. Drink 2018–2026.
A blend of fruit from Arianses, StoneTree and Heart of the Hill vineyards, this wine, which includes healthy dollops of Mourvèdre and Grenache, displays aromas of cocoa, tar, blackberry, vanilla and barrel spices. The flavors are medium-plus bodied backed by tart acids.
The mighty Hirsch rises to the occasion of a burly, near-perfect vintage, showing off its ability to be brawny and brainy at the same time. Black fruit, tar and tea take center stage, with an intensely tannic underbelly specked in wild herb and smoke. This baby needs time. Drink now after decanting or cellar through 2023.
In tasting this vintage for the second time, we found better balance than originally but still we encountered dull fruit, a lot of earthiness and leather, and some pickle barrel. That said, we also see this as a more elegant expression of Chilean Cab, one that will do well with food. Not for everyone but has its virtues. Imported by Global Vineyard Importers.
A rich, complex Zinfandel, showing the rustic mouthfeel sometimes found in Dry Creek reds. The tannins are strong and jagged, and the berry and cherry flavors have a wild, briary taste. But the finish is bone dry, and the wine grows more interesting as it breathes in the glass.
Thin and dilute, with tart red fruit and green-inflected tannins.
Here's a flat, broad and thick ripasso with dense chocolate notes followed by prunes, figs and dried fruit. The wine boasts deep extraction with a smooth core of mature cherry fruit. Overall, it tastes ripe and slightly jammy. Imported by Total Wine & More.
This is hardly a fashionable color for rosé, deep and almost like a light red wine. It tastes heavy, although the red fruits are cut by ample acidity. The finish is rich and ripe.
It's said that Viognier is difficult to grow, but then how can bargains such as this continue to exist? For $10, you get truffled pear aromas rounded out by the addition of melon, decent concentration and a long, dusty-minerally finish. Drink now.
Opens with light but earthy raspberry aromas and plum, and then it breaks up a bit with airing. The palate is lean but fresh and gritty, with cherry and cola flavors in front of a limited, narrow finish. Run-of-the-mill, which isn't bad given the price.
Smooth fruit and olive aromas are red-tinted and nice, while the palate is juicy, upright and tight, with plum, cherry and beet-like flavors. The finish is a carry over from what comes before, and overall this registers as fresh but common. Cabernet Sauvignon (50%) with Carmenère, Cab Franc and Petit Verdot.
The only thing that's not Porty about this wine is the sugar level. It's dry, but at the expense of dreadfully high, 16.1 percent alcohol. Bring a designated driver if you drink it.
Very big and rich and extracted, offering massive flavors of cherries and raspberries, enriched with caramelized oak. Very delicious, if a little obvious. Pinot Noirs from this stretch of the southern Santa Rita Hills tend to age well, gaining earthy complexities over the years. This one could hang in there for a long time.
This is the third consecutive year this wine has been rated 92 points. It is dense and potent, with aromas of cola, pencil lead and wild berry. It feels smooth, polished and finessed, with cola, vanilla, baking spice and vibrant black-fruit flavors. It finishes with licorice, toast and cola notes. Drink now–2017.
A warm amber color and intense, concentrated honey and toasted-nut aromas are followed by a supple, soft texture and mouthcoating flavors of sweet apricot and baked peaches. This will be fantastic as a dessert in itself, or with some less-sweet cookies or sautéed almonds.
This has thin fruit aromas, with scents of herb and candied milk chocolate. It's a solid wine for $8, with zesty acidity and standard raspberry and plum flavors. The lightweight finish turns lightly herbal.
This tartly acid-driven effort from Mumm includes Chardonnay and Pinot Gris. Honeyed aromas lead into a luxurious palate of thick mousse and crisp green apple flavors.
Three Sixty comes from four blocks of the Bucher Vineyard, planted to a range of clones. Made in small amounts, it offers a wealth and breadth of black cherry, vanilla and smoky oak, the tannins softened and well integrated into the whole. It takes on savory aspects of coffee and clove as it opens.
This wine is nearly black, with a purple rim, and smokey aromas of roasted salsa and leather. Despite the lack of fruit on the nose, there is plenty of dark underlying fruit to the palate, but still a roasted flavor, along with Band-Aid.
Apple, nectarine, lees and briny aromas steer this Godello toward a round, full palate. Slightly bitter flavors of melon and peach finish much like the wine starts—briny and leesy. This is also pithy tasting, like the inside of a grapefruit peel.
This tastes and feels a little heavy and sweet, with prominent cherry candy flavors. It's quite tasty, but one-dimensional in its appeal. Drink now—it's hard to see it devloping much in the bottle.
Vinous aromas of fresh red berry meld with a hint of chopped herb and a floral note. The slender, simple palate is a bit diluted but still offers red cherry and a note of espresso alongside racy acidity.
Here's a delightful red that offers fruity aromas of strawberry, wild red cherry and raspberry that carry through to the palate alongside notes of white pepper and mineral. It's easy drinking, with bright acidity and a smooth texture.
Similar to Brander's early release Sauvignon, this is a refreshingly dry, crisp wine, rich in citrus, fig and melon flavors, and clean as a whistle. What a great job the winery is doing with this varietal, at every price tier.
The aromas are light, with notes of fresh tobacco, tangerine peel, moist earth, cedar and cherry. The wood tannins come off as a little aggressive at present but there's plenty of lovely fruit there as well.
From one of the top vineyard sectors of Pouilly-Fumé, the wine is rich, full and complex. Spice and vanilla are contrasted with the intense acidity and steely white-fruit and citrus flavors. It is still young with its fruitiness bursting out of the glass. Wait until 2018.
This wine presents a dark wall of inky concentration with aromas of ripe fruit and raw cherry. There are earthy tones in the background that are characteristic of Sangiovese, with floral and menthol nuances as well. The tannins are firm and polished.
Dryish and tart in acidity, this has flavors of citrus, tropical fruit, Asian pear and green apple, marked by that distinctly Riesling note of diesel fuel.
Serious, stately Rioja with key aromas of prune, blackberry and leather. Snappy enough on the palate, with plenty of pop as well as pure berry flavors, smooth tannins, zest and dry vanilla. Some might call it a bit acidic and traditional, but with food it'll do great. Drink now through 2016. Only 250 cases made.
Upfront and immediate fragrances of sweet honey and acacia flower make this extremely aromatic.   The wine is bursting with sweet fruit freshness, creamy foam and sweet peach pie. It's also one of the best priced sparklers we've seen this year.
A beautiful wine that asserts itself near the top of the pile of Carneros Chardonnay. Shows brisk acidity and a tangy minerality, with oak-inspired, superripe green apple, Meyer lemon and pear fruit flavors that are wrapped into a creamy texture. Drink now.
Here's an enjoyable selection, offering ripe raspberry and black cherry flavors supported by bright acidity. Simple but well made, pair this with mildly seasoned cheeses, cured meats or ravioli.
Shows good varietal character in its bouquet of roses, ripe pears and lychees. As far as dessert wines go, this is a lightweight, at only 6% residual sugar, but it's certainly flavorful enough. Low acidity suggests it should be drunk over the short term. The only quibble is a shorter than expected finish.
Pale in color, this light wine makes up in flavor for its thin feel. The tart cherry and wild berry fruit is expansive, and the flavors are supported by bright, but not sharp acidity. It's soft and easy, a very likeable house red.
Aromas of prune and cocoa powder accurately portend a chunky, plodding palate with flat tannins. This is at maximum ripeness, but it's not totally balanced, as raisin, mint and black pepper flavors finish with heat and herbal notes.
Bianco Maggiore delivers touches of lemon drop and kiwi with fresh lime and yellow rose. The mouthfeel is thicker and denser than you'd expect, and it offers a long, tangy fruit-driven finish.
There's beautiful blackberry and cassis fruit in this Cab, undergirded by a rich, coffee-infused earthiness. It's completely dry and the tannins are fairly fierce, but nothing a good steak can't negotiate. In fact, it's a great food wine, classy and understated. The best Sobon Cab ever and a great value.
The wine has some weight and an attractive meat and smoke character to go with the black berry fruits. Well balanced, shot through with acidity.
Easily the richest of Schug's current trio of Chards, showing the elegance and crispness of the other bottlings, but with more fruity intensity. It's still a fairly restrained wine, rich in acidity and dry minerality, but rewards with pineapple custard and butterscotch flavors.
Aromas of candied fruit shape a ripe and slightly jammy wine with aromas of cooked blueberry and bramble. The wine is not too thick and heavy and, in fact, adds a refreshing element of crispness in the mouth. A Marc de Grazia selection, various American importers.
Made with no added sulfites, this has aromas suggesting resin and balsamic notes. The palate is almost overripe and rather evolved, offering dried apricot and crystallized ginger while a note of candied nectarine zest marks the close.
Delicate scents of white flowers and fresh herbs frame the core notes of green apple and lime zest. Refreshing and easy drinking, ample acidity lifts the melon pith and citrus peel flavors that flesh out the medium-weight palate, finishing clean yet short.
A solid Pinot Noir, silky and rich in raspberry, cherry and smoky oak flavors. Notable for its silky texture and balancing acidity, it's a lovely wine to drink now and over the next few years.
Unctuous and ripe in caramel and toasty aromas, this is deep golden in color but completely crisp and balanced in the glass. The nose is so overwhelming that the flavors take time to show. Once they do, it's a celebration of green apple and melon enveloped in complex minerality and a supple body.
A blend of 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot and 5% Petit Verdot, this bold wine features aromas of spiced plum, blackcurrant, leather and a hint of coconut. On the palate, assertive tannins support the mature blackberry, espresso and licorice flavors.
Saint Odile is patron saint of Alsace, with this walled vineyard in Obernai named after her. This complex wine is moving in the direction of sweetness although it still has a nervy, almost mineral character. Textured and young, it needs to develop. Drink from 2016.
While the texture is light, the fruit and the wood flavors give this wine richness and a ripe, toast and apricot character. It has balanced acidity that allows a fresher edge to develop. The aftertaste, hinting at a steely edge, suggests the wine will age. Drink from 2017.
Made from Friuli's classic white grape, this vibrant wine leads with aromas of honeysuckle, baked pear and flint. The elegant, linear palate delivers yellow apple, Bartlett pear and lime zest accented with notes of sage, clove and cinnamon. Fresh acidity gives a bright finish.
This Brunello offers a distinctive note of spice, leather, moist earth or porcino mushroom at the start that slowly segues to dried fruit, prune and black currant. There's also cured beef and smoked bacon fat. It offers, big, plush and bold tones with chewy concentration and sweet cherry fruit on the close.
In Coelho's revamped lineup, Renovação has double the residual sugar of the entry-level Pinot Gris, clocking in at 10 g/L. Fleshed out with riper fruit, it recalls apple, pear and peach and is interspersed with honeycomb notes, resulting in a round, ripe mouthfeel that is very satisfying.
This is a fresh and easy Moscato d'Asti that opens with floral aromas and honey, backed by peach, dried sage and honeydew melon. Like the name of the grape suggests, there is a musky quality to this Moscato with more honey and dried herb on the close.
A big, rich, exuberant Malbec, one of the better ones out there. It's firm in tannins, yet soft and luscious, with deep, dark plum, cassis, beef jerky and spice flavors. Grows even finer and elegant as it warms in the glass.
Made with a minimal-intervention mind-set, this marries classic French winemaking to tight, almost steely Willamette Valley fruit. It's a taut, tense wine, focused on raspberry/cherry fruit, with firm, chocolate-tinged tannins. Highlights of malted milk and tobacco sneak into the extended finish.
With its green edge, this is not a ripe vintage wine. Certainly, the fruit is dense and sweet, but there is always the feeling of astringency, black currant juiciness that does not suggest aging.
A solidly structured wine, this is firm in both its tannins and in its mineral texture. Black cherry flavors are combined with a dense, dry core to give a wine that's both fruity now and worth aging for 1–3 years. Screwcap.
This wine is two thirds Cabernet Sauvignon with the balance being Merlot (25%) and Syrah. Vanilla, cocoa and dark fruit aromas lead to rich, well balanced fruit and barrel flavors that linger on the finish.
Green aromas of oregano and basil blend with tomato and red plum. It feels grabby and thick, with heavy flavors of carob and herb-accented red berry.
Smells caramelly and rich in blackberries, and then turns semi-sweet in the mouth, with cassis, chocolate and coffee flavors. The tannins show up on the finish.
Tannic and chewy, this is dominated by flavors of char and espresso. Rather light red fruit peeks out from behind, but the oak absolutely dominates.
There's a dark, savory quality to this richly concentrated wine that is reminiscent of aromas of air-dried beef or spicy bresaola. You'll also get ripe fruit and blackberry jam and there's a textured, gritty quality to the firm but ripe tannins.
A big, dark, rich wine with an impressively opulent structure allied to fresh, bright Merlot character. The flavors of black berry juice are followed by chocolate, bitter coffee and vibrant acidity, which gives freshness to the finish.
Treana has enjoyed great success with this blend of Viognier and Marsanne, which is one of the best Rhône-style white wines in California. The main reason is the source of the grapes. The vineyard, owned by the Wagners of Caymus, is stellar. The '06 is as rich and crisply acidic as ever, with fantastically complex, honeyed tropical fruit, apricot and floral flavors that taste like they have a touch of botrytis.
This is a bright, integrated and extremely impressive blend of different estate-vineyard sources. Effortlessly enjoyed, it's nonetheless plenty complex underneath the pleasing fruit and acidity. Tart plum, raspberry, pomegranate and touches of cola and mocha combine for a seamless, satisfying experience.
This single-vineyard wine tastes young and dense in youth. It shows deliciously ripe and forward cherry, raspberry, bacon and spice flavors, in a silky clean texture. There's an edge of tannins, but not so much that you couldn't enjoy it now and over the next six years.
This medium-bodied wine has a slightly dusty mouthfeel, which gives its palate just enough shape to highlight the flavors of dried dark-skinned fruit. It's a little pruney, but would probably work fine with stews or hard cheeses.
There's a touch of hot asphalt, pencil lead and miso on the nose of this first vintage from a promising, well-funded project, with dark elderberry fruit and dried dill rounding out the aromas. The palate blends a gamy beef quality with oregano, marjoram, cooked strawberry, baked blackberry and a sesame-oil character.
As rich as Chardonnay gets in California, offering massive waves of pineapple jam, apricots, tangerines and tropical notes of papayas and guavas. Without oak, the fruit stars, along with tantalizing acidity.
A broad, rich wine with spice, pepper and a fine, fresh acidity. This is ripe, retaining a good balance. Screwcap.
This would pair with a cigar or dark chocolate cake. It's a smooth, rich wine, with firm tannins and lasting tones of ripe blackberry and raspberry.
Fantastic fruit, tantalizing acidity and overall balance mark this Pinot. It's ripe with cherries, pomegranates, rhubarb and persimmons, while plentiful new oak is perfectly in keeping with the underlying power. Drink now, after proper decanting, or age over the next 5–15 years, as it gradually reveals different sides of itself.
A note of jammy blackberry opens the nose of this easygoing, soft and plush wine. More ripe berry flavors appear on the finish.
Creamy and lush, with pure peach and pear aromas along with nice vanilla accents. The palate is fairly rich and layered, but it's also properly acidic and, therefore, well balanced. The flavors of pear and butter seem on the money, and the finish is solid and of moderate length. All in all, this is a very good Chardonnay with no overt faults.
Spice, cherry and chewy blueberry characterize this youthful Syrah from Sicily. This is a generous and proud value wine that delivers aromas of white pepper, plum, dark fruit and hickory smoke. It offers an easy, pleasurable drinking experience that won't hit your wallet.
From 40-plus-year-old vines planted on old rootstock, this wine is tangy in pomegranate, rhubarb and kirsch, but marked most by an irresistible depth of earthy truffle and black tea. Fine, dusty tannins add to the complexity of the mouthfeel and finish, with a hint of cinnamon at the end.
Well oaked and woodsy, with some earthy nuances as well as scents of campfire and rubber. This is a youngster with aggressive tannins and sharp edges. With a bit of time it'll soften, leaving a top-flight wine with cherry, citrus rind and a hint of sweet oak.
Ripe, with jammy red fruits, this is an attractively fruity wine. It has maraschino cherry flavors, intertwined with acidity to give structure, a fresh character and soft tannins. Drink this year.
Richly ripe, with flamboyant green apple and peach flavors, and lots of oak. Nice creamy texture, and dry. Notable for the lush quality of its acids, which make the wine crisp and tart through the finish.
There's no denying the intensity of this 60-40 blend, but could we dial up the ripeness just a little bit? This is tart almost to the point of sourness, with lemony flavors that last a good long time. Pair it with raw shellfish for best effect.
Peach and tangerine unite to create an utterly seductive nose: luscious juicy flesh is defined by aromatic spice and zestiness. These opposites play off each other and create something that is alive and vigorous, joyful and precious. There is concentration and poise, structure and texture, but none of this concerns the hedonistic forces at play. They just want to express their careless exuberance. There is something defiant about this dry concentrated wine. Perhaps it is a welcome and encouraging counterweight to so much sadness in the world.
Power and elegance come together in this beautifully proportioned, flavorful and pure-tasting wine. It has depth, concentration and a luxurious but structured texture that pulls the pomegranate, black cherry and cranberry flavors through to a lip-smacking, lingering finish. This can only get better with time; best after 2022.
Many see the Touriga Nacional in the Dão as superior to the same grape in the Douro. As in this wine, it has power and richness, but with extra complexity, the fruit powered by dark tannins. The structure is solid, with a firm, spicy elegance.
A light style of Pinot Noir, this is dry and racy. It offers good persimmon and cola flavors, and is very spicy. A trace of green is distracting.
Made the way Pinot Grigio should be. Bone dry and zesty in acidity, it has citrus, mineral and floral flavors that finish with a scour of peppery spice. A brilliant cocktail sipper that will also complement savory appetizers.
Almost ready to drink, this wood-aged wine is packed with herbs, dark berry fruits and the first signs of secondary spice and leather flavors. The tannins are still powerful and need to soften further, so drink this complex, concentrated wine from 2016.
Light, quiet layers of spice persist in this elegant, soft yet refined wine. Rose petal, orange, cherry and rhubarb flavors provide subtle fruitiness, supported by vibrant acidity and unobtrusive oak.
There are complicated aromas and flavors to this blend from Santa Barbara County pioneer Rick Longoria. It starts with scents of wet dog, pine, pipe tobacco and peppercorns. The flavors recall gamy meat, like roasted lamb, with hints of stewed plum as well. Those who don't like constantly analyzing each sip may find this wine challenging.
This is a ripe, sweet and immediately attractive dessert wine, with forward aromas and flavors of dried apricot, golden raisin, papaya, honeycomb and gingered orange. Hints of sweet spice and toasted nuts unfold on the long close. It's viscous and lush, but with ample acidity to lift the finish. Drink now–2018.

Drink now–2010. Imported by Baystate Wine Co.
Big, ripe, juicy wine, threaded by tannins. It has an elegant structure, with bright black berry fruits to go with the layers of smoky wood and tannins. Age for 3-4 years.
In its bottle reminiscent of an old-style gin bottle, this is certainly a stand-out in terms of appearance. The wine is less interesting, pale in color, fat in style.
A masterpiece it may be, but right now, in its precocious youth, it's all jammy fruit and smoky oak. But what jam! What oak! Tastes rich and compellingly good, like being swept away on a tidal wave of blackberry essence and cocoa. Very good, very rich, very fine, but you want to stash it away for a few years to let the parts meld.
An acidic, minerally Chardonnay  showing structure, cleanliness and elegance. Richness comes by way of intense limes, as well as the usual complexities of new oak and lees aging, and there is not the slightest suggestion of sweetness. This is a very pure, Zen-like expression of cool-climate California Chardonnay.
Shy at first aromatically, this wine slowly reveals blueberry candy, hoisin sauce, dried plums and pencil shavings on the nose. The palate is thick and lush, with lots of slate-driven structure and ample black-plum fruit spiced up with charred tobacco and singed wood.
The 4% Petit Verdot in this dark, inky Cabernet Sauvignon is doing its job in terms of color and structure, adding much of both to the mix. Overall the wine is savory and full-bodied on the palate, with bits of spicy clove and sage around black cherry and toasted oak. Enjoy through 2030.
Aged in stainless steel, this faint SB is herb-y and slightly grassy. Sweetness on the midpalate sticks around before the quick finish.
A robust, spicy wine that offers lots of bang for the buck. The flavors range from lush raspberries and red cherries up through blackberries and currants, veering into mocha, and there's lots of crushed black pepper. Easy to like with steak, lamb, Mexican food.
Coming from seven different vineyards spread across the Columbia Valley, this wine—which includes 13% Sauvignon Blanc—brings notes of fig, browned butter and candy corn. It's full bodied with a creamy texture and a warm finish.
Zesty lime-skin notes lend elegance to this lavishly floral, fruity saprkling Chardonnay. It's brisk and clean on the palate, with startling citrus acidity that cuts through a thick, heavy mousse.
Il Palazzone is a beautiful estate with a bright future ahead. Its 2008 Brunello is marked by lush fruit tones of cherry and blackberry followed by dried ginger, chopped mint, spice and pressed rose petal. In the mouth, it shows that telltale acidity of Sangiovese  Grosso.
Tropical fruit, pear and honey typify this distinctive Chenin from South Africa's Swartland region. It's round and smooth but not heavy, making it an excellent wine for diverse food pairing. Think hard, salty cheeses or seafood.
This wine is a unique blend of Roussanne (59%), Sauvignon Blanc (26%) and Marsanne. The aromas are perfumed with notes of flowers, citrus, peach and lees. The flavors are sweet, with Sauvignon's herbal streak running throughout. It provides intrigue.
Putting your nose into a glass of Oddero Barolo Villero is like sniffing a handful of Langhe soil. This wine speaks highly of its territory with aromas of smoke, earth, forest berry, white truffle, hazelnut, cola, root beer, humus and dried apple skins. In the mouth, the tannins are impressively polished and fine.
Spectacular aromas of sea salt, dried lemon peels, seared mandarins, chamomile, lemongrass, kaffir lime and plumeria make the mouth water simply upon smelling this savory wine. The sip is loaded with tension and judicious acidity, and yet the flavors are soft, from lemon meringue to crisp pluot and vanilla dust.
A profoundly deep nose of red and black fruit, with cedar, ginger and nutmeg. The sense of balance and grace is sublime, as layers of cassis, plum and cinnamon keep unfolding. The chewy finish is lengthy and elegant, and it should be held for no less than five years. This bottling honors its pedigree as California's first classic Cabernet.
Aromas of tire rubber, graphite and wet cement are oak-driven and overshadow wine's berry components. A tannic, resiny palate is expected, given the nose. Heavy oak overshadows black-plum flavors, while the finish is oaky, minty and a touch green.
Smooth textured, yet with a pleasing bright, spicy edge. The wine shows a complex blend of bing cherry, plum, pepper, spice, coffee, earth and anise flavors. Soft tannins give it a round mouthfeel. The finish is long and bright.
Earthy lemon and tart flavors of freshly cut green apples play on nose and palate. With time on the palate, the lemony freshness dominates and lingers texturally, with a suggestion of apple peel. This has lots of freshness and a dry finish.
The 2006 is a good follow-up to the winery's 2005; both offer sweet, pleasing fruit—strawberries and cherries—and fairly substantial tannins. The 2006 is less earthy and herbal than the previous version, but the acids seem chalky and a bit out of whack at the moment. Give this one plenty of airing out.
Here's a caramel and red fruit-flavored wine that is soft and round. It is light and bright, with a light prickle on the tongue as well as a tangy, orange peel texture. Screwcap.
The bouquet of white peach and wet stones is fresh as can be. There's a rich texture to the palate, with flavors of cinnamon and spice accenting ripe pear. Finishes long and fairly full with some banana flavor.

This sweet wine is full of lychee fruit and the lightest touch of acidity. It's on the light side and has freshness and a crisp edge, bringing out baked apple as well as peaches and a final lightly honeyed texture. Drink now.
Argentino is a Malbec made from two vineyards: Adrianna in Tupungato and Nicasia in Vista Flores/Altamira. Aged for two years in new oak, it's a dark, vibrant masculine wine with excellent depth of flavor, seductive berry flavors, and lots of length. It hits with force but also finesse, and it shows the extracted richness that comes from small-lot open bin fermentation.
This is a mature Cabernet that's still generous in brambly black cherry and plum, with layers of spice intermingled among the fine tannins and charred oak. Black tea and tobacco complete the intrigue of this wine, with a black licorice finish.
Here's a beautiful Riserva Pinot Bianco that delivers intense aromas of stone fruit, honey, melon and toasted almond. The wine rests on the lees for eight months for extra heft and density on its naturally rich texture. Pair it with shellfish or white meat.
One of the oldest wineries in Central Otago, Rippon helped pave the way for the success of the region, but recent vintages have lacked the excitement exhibited by some of the newcomers' wines. Toast and brown sugar notes frame crisp black cherry and plum flavors, finishing a bit short.
This 46% Merlot, 31% Cabernet Sauvignon, 23% Cab Franc blend has got some real muscle and Cabernet strength, with black cherry, cassis and plenty of chocolaty oak. It seems to fade a bit in the mid-palate and then regroup, finishing strong and slightly hot, with coffee-flavored tannins. It can certainly benefit from additional bottle age.
A pretty shade of pink bordering on mauve, this bottling shows bright watermelon, fresh strawberry and even red-plum aromas on the nose. The palate is zesty, almost effervescent, with baking-soda texture and lots of energy on the sip but not tons of flavor, with light red-berry elements.
BFM stands for Blow Your Freakin' Mind, say the winemakers, whose marketing spin is to aggressively position their wines as ready to party. Nonetheless this four grape Bordeaux blend is priced to compete with serious and substantial wines from around the world, and in terms of flavor it does so competently. Though no Sangiovese is listed in the blend, it shows some of the high-acid and tobacco leaf qualities of that grape, and has a good mix of leafy herb, light red fruits, hints of leather and grippy acid throughout.
Aged in American oak for approximately 11 months, this Bordeaux-style blend of 80% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Cabernet Franc and 10% Merlot is medium bodied and supple, with astringency that kicks in on the midpalate. The acidity keeps the palate feeling lively, and the notes of blackberry, cassis, tobacco and mocha are stimulating.
This mature, yeasty sparkler from Mendoza smells of brioche and baked apple. Flavors of sourdough bread, cider and white mushroom finish bready and soft, so drink now.
Now fully integrated, this is a firm black-fruit flavored wine. It has dark tannins that are dry and solid, contrasted with blackberry fruit flavors and fresh acidity. There is a touch of spice giving a peppery edge to the wine. It will age further, so drink from 2017.
92-94 Dark tannins and structure go with the most powerful fruit. Full of ripe berries, this has all the structure and density. The acidity helps it on its way.
This new, nonvintage version of McCrea's Cotes du Rhône-style blend is an interesting wine, with far more complexity than most inexpensive red blends from Washington. The fruit is soft and plummy, drinking very well, with no rough edges, but lots of spice and rock.
A step up from Allemand's Chaillot bottling, the 2004 Reynard boasts more intense cassis fruit and even some licorice and spice notes. It's rich, layered and tannic, needing some time to show its best. Drink 2010–2020.
Racy and intensely flavored, this is high in acidity and has spectacularly concentrated flavors of apple, peach, citrus and tropical fruit. With no oak at all, the fruit stars—pure and clean. Even though the residual sugar is technically zero, the finish tastes sweet, so pair it with slightly sweet foods, especially Vietnamese, Chinese or Thai.
Some tropical passionfruit notes manage to appear despite the aromatic restraint, on the palate they find their expression, but are balanced by fresh lemony flavors that are almost thirst-quenching in this cracking and slender wine.
Here's a good, everyday-style Merlot. It's dry and medium-bodied, with pleasant flavors of black cherries, black currants and oak, finished with a savory edge of tannins. Shows class beyond its price.
This big-boy red combines 30% Cabernet Franc with 20% each of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, adding 15% each of Malbec and Petit Verdot for an all-five red-Bordeaux-varietal blend. Coconut flakes and vanilla-hugged oak ride sticky tannins to a quick finish, offering huge ripeness along the way.
A great follow-up to the winery's 2011, made this time from an esteemed vineyard in one of the coldest parts of the valley. The vintage was difficult, but the wine is rich in raspberry, cranberry and persimmon flavors, brightened by crisp acidity and finishing totally dry. There's no reason not to drink it now.
In the trilogy of wines made at Ponzac, this is the one to drink young. It comes from chalky soil that gives soft tannins and ripe blackberry fruits. It is fruity and soft with just an edge of structure and with plenty of acidity to finish. Drink from 2017.

This moderately aromatic wine features notes of black cherry, clove and abundant high-toned herbs. A supple mouthfeel with black fruit flavors accompanies firm, dry tannins.

A ripe and creamy style, with caramel and spicy red cherry flavors. Full, warm, only light on the acidity.
Quara makes good, true Cafayate Torrontés. Aromas of lychee, citrus, tropical fruits and bath oils are vital. This remains solid and clean, with upright acidity. Lime, mango, lychee and banana flavors finish round, with just enough acidity to maintain the wine's character. Drink immediately.
A majority of 75% Cabernet Sauvignon is at the core of this exceptional value, a wine that's classic in red, high-toned cherry and currant fruit. Soft, yet with ample structure, it offers everything one needs in a hearty red wine that's also accessible now.
This wine is crisp with refreshing acidity and fine lemon and grapefruit flavors. It's light and poised while still packing tangy fruit. Drink now.
As rich as this Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend is, and it is extraordinarily rich, there's something standard about it. It's as though the ripeness of the fruit has obliterated any trace of terroir. Offers a fantastically sweet explosion of blackberries, cherries, plums and chocolate, alongside caramelized, butterscotchy oak, but beyond the sheer power, the wine isn't displaying much subtlety. Hard to tell where it's going, if anywhere.
A wine with some density of flavor to go with its intense green apple character. It has some ripe green berries, laced with pink grapefruit.
Starts with young, bouncy, foxy aromas and then settles on berry fruit and bacon fat. The palate is somewhat rooty and sweet, with solid tannins, body and respectable cassis and berry flavors. A sweet wine with adequate richness and reasonably true Cabernet qualities.
Lots of dark-fruit aromas and fresh cherry-berry flavors keep this medium-bodied wine lively and easy to enjoy. Light spicy, nutty flavors and a touch of milk chocolate add interest, while the texture is smooth.
Rounded and soft, this is a red-fruited wine. There is a strong element of spicy wood lending dryness and a cinnamon note, which goes well with the young, bright fruits and acids.
Light, elegant and lithe on the nose, with a touch of stemminess to the core plum and cherry aromas. Feels just right, with a feminine touch and snap to the mouthfeel. Flavors of red plum, raspberry, herbs, tomato and dried spice lead to a fresh, focused finish. Top level for under $15.
Mineral, firm wine, although at the same time it has plenty of black plum fruits surrounding the core of dark tannins. The resulting wine is one that manages to combine the structure of Cahors while bringing out a fruity character.
This wine is quietly powerful, packed with tightly wound fruit flavors that are wrapped in a firm coating of velvety tannin. It has plenty of grip on the palate, but also plenty of underlying blackberry, boysenberry and black-pepper flavors. It's sure to improve with time, so best to drink after 2022.
Made from a blend of Ribolla Gialla and Malvasia Istriana, this rich but finessed wine conveys delicate aromas of hawthorne, stone fruit and slate. The succulent palate delivers apricot, tangerine and lime accented with mineral and bitter almond. An unusual, compelling wine.
Dark, bitterly dry and mouth-puckeringly tannic, this is not a wine for those looking for immediate hedonistic pleasure. Although extensive decanting and big, rich meats and cheeses will help, it's really built for the cellar. Should hold and soften for 20 years.
Brisk and vibrant with juicy plum, cherry and earthy herbal flavors. Accents of cocoa and thin mint develop on the lingering finish. Drink now.
Pristine peach, tangerine and blossom notes form the core of this fragrant fruity Riesling. Balanced in sweetness and reverberating with acidity, it's an exceptional value for such a juicy satisfying sip. Capture its youthful exuberance now through 2020.
Here's a good Napa Cab at a decent price that will take some cellar age. Mainly from Rutherford grapes, it's showing some stiff tannins, but, with polished cherry, herb and oak flavors, it drinks well now, and should develop for five years.
This is a softer Sauvignon Blanc for those not sworn to the grassy side of the grape, as the Buellton-based winery does a lot of barrel-fermenting. Aromas include pressed kiwi and a sour pucker of lime, and the broiled pear flavors prove easy drinking, if not exceedingly complex.
Underbrush, cured meat, grilled herb, menthol and dark-skinned fruit aromas unfold in the glass. The chewy palate offers dried black berry, black cherry, licorice, coffee and toasted nut alongside tightly packed tannins. Drink 2019–2022.
This is made from 80% Syrah and 20% Grenache, the grapes sourced from two estate vineyards on Howell Mountain. Thick, peppery meat and leather notes are framed by densely layered tannins and an impressive backbone of acidity. It finishes in a flourish of pretty mountain flowers and wild vanilla.
A real find. French in style, dry, rich and elegant. Hints of cherry and cassis are wrapped in thick, fine tannins, and the mouthfeel is sensual and velvety. Delicious now, but should hold through the decade. Grapes from Yorkville Highlands. The winemaker is the well-known Kerry Damsky.
Rich and silky, but a little heavy and soft. The polished cherry, raspberry, red currant, cola and bacon flavors are delicious, even complex, with an array of spices, and there's a lovely mouthfeel of silk and satin. But there's a certain direct quality. Drink now.
A surprisingly poor showing from this normally reliable winery, the 2000 Classico, a blend of Pinot Bianco, Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc, shows some lemony aromas, a plump, custardy mouthfeel and a tangy finish.
Golden Delicious apples and yellow Mirabelle plums vie for attention on the nose of this focused, citrus-fresh Grüner. This is mineral and nervy, zesty and taut and very streamlined. While there is fine spritz, it is serious and sleek with complex yeasty notes woven in.
Balsam, lush prune and all sorts of earthy, interesting aromas set this rich, ripe Carmenère off on a wild ride. Chocolate greets you at the front door, with deep plum and berry waiting behind. It's saturated and superripe but it doesn't lose step or steam. Excellent in the ultraripe, modern style.
Gravel, dark red berries and a raw beef character show on the nose of this accessibly priced wine. The palate offers beet and dark cranberry juice flavors, along with black sage and camphor. Still tightly wound, it will get better with patience.
From one of Germany's few biodynamic producers, this combines struck flint and honeyed ripeness on the nose, then offers apple, citrus and fennel-like flavors. Despite the medium body, the acids are bracing and almost sharp on the finish.
Gold in color and short on bubbles, but heavy on sweetness and residual sugar. That said, it's an advertised semidry, so a certain level of cloy is expected. But this tips too far to the sweet side, leaving nothing but refined white sugar, banana and vanilla cream. Not my cup of tea.
Rich round fleshy fruit flavors of pear and cantaloupe show excellent concentration. There's a powdered sugary sweetness lurking in the background, not unpleasantly, but this is no bone dry example of Pinot Gris. Drink chilled with cold chicken or light pasta dishes.
Made from 60-year-old vines, evidenced by its concentration and serious ageability. It is structured, firm and relatively dry at this young stage. It's a wine that needs at least 5 years. Today, if you do open a bottle, watch for the mineral, stony character that pushes the fruit and demands attention.
Cedar, pencil and wild mushroom scents accent the nose of this wine—a blend of 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Cabernet Franc, 20% Merlot and 10% Sangiovese. Generous tannins give additional weight to the overall concentration. The finish feels dusted with spicy clove.
Butterscotch, honey and spice aromas lead this white from Porto Carras. The wine has a slightly heavy feel with vanilla and spice overtones leasing. Overall though, a pretty wine with a serious character.
This is a dense and rich wine that shows both smoothness as well as an edgy mineral texture. It's weighty on the palate with ripe white and yellow fruits and a rounded, juicy character. Fruit and wood aging are still coming together, so give it some time. Drink this stylish wine from 2016.
This basic, intensely ripe wine shows less fruit and acidity than toasty spice and oak. Fruit is sourced from Sangiacomo Vineyards and the wine fermented in both barrels and stainless steel.
Aromas of Key lime skins and lemon bar cookies hide a slight but typical petrol note on this wine from the San Diego County-based producer. It's slightly sour on the citrusy palate, with balanced acidity and a chalky grip.
This has flavors of oranges, Meyer lemons and tropical fruits, and there's a good burst of acidity that lends balance. The finish tastes a bit sweet. Pair this selection with Vietnamese, Chinese, Thai, Indian or Ethiopian dishes.
ots of briary, brambly wild berry and cherry fruit in this robust Zin. Also lots of mouthwatering spices. It's basically dry, but jammy sweet also, suggesting pairing with barbecue sauces made with sugar.
Big on tannins and equally big on ripe fruit, this is a rich wine. Its dense texture and bold blackberry flavors are coming together well. Drink from 2021.
This is earthy, rubbery and big on the nose, which isn't unusual for Bonarda. The tannins clamp down on the palate, tasting roasted, with hickory and smoked meat flavors sticking out. It's dense but not very active on the finish.
Fragrant, aromatic, grassy aromas give way to fresh, crisp, green fruit and gooseberry flavors. Finishes lively and vibrant.
Briny saltwater aromas dominate a mild mostly fruitless nose. This feels basic and round, with a lemony streak. Mild nectarine flavors don't amount to much, while this is simple and generic on the finish.
There is something smoky and grilled about the nose. While the red fruit of strawberry and cherry is fresh, there are also aromas of roasted oak. Nonetheless, the fruit itself is delicate and tart, translucent and unforced. The palate is slender and fresh, with a deep core of red berries. This may take time to come into its own. Drink 2018–2024.
Considering this is Petite Sirah, this is surprisingly soft and gentle—almost like a Pinot Noir. The texture is silky, with flavors of cherries, currants, Canadian bacon and black pepper. Drink now.
Dark and intense in spicy blackberry, cherry, cocoa and earthy flavors with a hint of bitter espresso. The rich but smooth tannins and crisp acidity of this ripe wine cry out for beef or lamb.
Full-bodied, rich and unctuous, this is an exotic, flamboyant white Châteauneuf-du-Pape for drinking over the next year. Grilled pineapple is drizzled with caramel and cinnamon, wrapping up long and lush.
This wine is tight and crisp, with an earthy character. Touches of honey and ripe apricots fill out the back palate and give a richer feel to the aftertaste.
This light rosé is scented with rosewater, melon and strawberry. Finished dry and nicely structured.
Black cherry, clove and smoked meat aromas are rolled up into one wondrously savory scent in this 50-50 blend of Mourvèdre and Syrah. Flavors of beef roasted in blackberry and Sherry sauce sprinkled with oregano and marjoram entertain the complex palate.
While pressed apple notes seem savory on the nose, the palate of this dry Seyval Blanc is surprisingly fresh boasting a delicate honeydew flavor. There's not a lot of concentration or power, but it's pleasant and crisp, with lingering lemon-lime acidity.
Produced from organic grapes, like so many in Provence, this is light, fruity and lively. Fresh acidity goes with the red currant fruits and the tight, nervy texture. It's lightly perfumed and fine as an apéritif.
Hints of asparagus and struck flint give an almost Sancerre-like impression before heading in a lemony direction. This lean, citrusy wine offers good value, but consumers should be looking out for stocks of the 2015, a better vintage that should be arriving soon.
From vines around the village of Lancié (near Moulin-à-Vent and Fleurie), this ripe, warm rosé is full of red-berry fruits that have raspberry and tangy bitter orange flavors. It's rich, spicy and a rosé for food.
A creamy wine, with fresh acidity touched with spicy wood. It has the comfortable, plump feel of Meursault, but with some crispness. There are good citrus and white fruit flavors, even apricots, and then the acidity leaves a lifted, lively finish.
On the nose there are medicinal aromas alongside some sweet candy. The palate is a mix of red berry candies and firm tannins, and caramel from wood. The wine is given shape by tannins and has a juicy red fruit aftertaste.
Strong aromas of new wood are confirmed by the palate, where wood flavors dominate. This is a structured wine, showing fruit acidity under the wood and sufficient weight of red berry fruits to come through in another six months.
This medium-bodied white features attractive scents of lime zest and pineapple. On the palate, the flavors veer toward apple and citrus, which fade rapidly on the finish. Drink now.
Sweet and musky smelling, which in its own way is appealing. The palate is a mix of grapefruit, melon and other citrus, and lively acids keep it kicking while your tongue does a double take. Good, but a bit too tangy and jumpy.
Minerally melon and citrus aromas are good and lead to a nice, creamy feeling palate with a full mix of lime, melon, apple, green herb and spice flavors. This is round and lightly citric on the finish. Drink immediately.
Morgan's been on a roll the last couple of years, now that they've figured out how to make this wine from fruit grown in a cool part of the Highlands. Aged in older oak barrels, the wine shows no wood at all, but has a creamy softness that modifies the crisp lemon, lime, grapefruit, pear and wildflower flavors. This is one of the best Pinot Gris in California.
For those who like fruit over oak, this 50/50 blend, a marriage you don't see very often, is just what the doctor ordered. The Cab component sees a year in barrel; the Syrah no wood at all. The end result is a juicy, pure wine that sports blueberry and cassis as well as a touch of savory spice. Perfect for pizza or a barbecue. Imported by Palm Bay Imports.
Gorgeously ripe fruit packs this wine with tropical flavors of cantaloupe, apricot and papaya. Lemony acid keeps it fresh and vibrant, and the overall texture and complexity are a revelation. Both of Evening Land's Chardonnays elevate the grape to new heights in this part of the Willamette Valley.
Almond flavors and a touch of bitterness give this wine a hard edge. It has spice, pepper and good acidity, although there is not enough fruit to go around.
A hugely rich, powerful Chardonnay, layering ripe fruit with a core of tannic structure, acidity, wood and huge depth of flavor. The wine is concentrated, with layers of fruit and textured acidity. Of course, it needs aging—7 years at least.
Dried sage and a hint of saddle leather highlight this dry, dusty wine noteworthy for its bright, buoyant acidity and layering of red currant. It delivers plenty of full-bodied flavor within a complex, approachable experience.
89-91. Barrel sample. Initially hard edged, this wine evolves to show a more accessible, fruity character. There is weight here, powered by fruit tannins and a solid texture on the finish.
Despite the moniker, this blend of Counoise, Mourvèdre, Malbec, Zinfandel and Petit Sirah strays pretty far afield from the southern Rhône. It's an edgy, stylized effort, light with tart rhubarb fruit, wild berries and plenty of tongue-tingling acidity. Yet it does not lack for flavor, detail, or interest. For acid hounds.
Broad, foresty black-fruit aromas are spicy and lush. Although this Petit Verdot is nice on the nose and tastes good, the mouthfeel is off due to shrill tartaric acidity. Savory and sour plum flavors clash, and it feels raw and grating on the finish.
This is vibrant and expressive, with upfront purple-flower fragrances of violet and iris mixed with fruity tones of boysenberry and raspberry sauce. The crushed-silk texture offers medium tannins, ample acidity and skin-driven fruit flavors. Roasted coffee bean and sweet smoke accents mark the lingering finish.
The 2003 Billi Billi Shiraz features slightly medicinal flavors of cherries and rhubarb accented by scorched chocolate notes and a hint of eucalyptus. The texture is creamy-smooth, while the finish lingers elegantly. It's a pleasant counterpoint to some of the heavyweight Shirazes from South Australia, at a bargain price.
Dark and concentrated but simultaneously fresh and juicy, this blend of 65% Syrah and 35% Grenache offers heady notes of black cherry, plum and raspberry accented by hints of game and tree bark. The meaty, medium-weight palate offers a firm structure and a solid finish.
Black olive, herbs and crude oil create an incredibly dark nose, while the ripe, meaty palate is loaded with berry fruit and chocolate. Finishes hefty and powerful, but where's the nuance? Where's the additional layers? They're not here. Imported by Dreyfus, Ashby & Co.
This has jammy aromas of strawberry and raspberry that would work well at cocktail hour. The palate is lean.
Citrus, passion fruit and lime are draped all over the quality bouquet. The palate is juicy and offers a mild spritzy feel, while the palate is sweet and easy but maintains its necessary core citrus and mineral qualities. Finishes mild, smooth and a little sweet.
Soft, smooth and fruity, this polished wine is full of red berry fruits and a touch of licorice. The juicy, ripe, immediately attractive aftertaste comes from the local Castelão grapes in the blend. Drink now.
Aromas of beeswax, white spring flowers and stone fruit lead the nose. The savory palate doles out nectarine zest, passion fruit, yellow peach and a ginger note alongside bright acidity.
This isn't the most complicated Pinot Noir, but it is a clean, easy-drinking wine. With raspberry and cherry flavors wrapped into a silky texture, it will be fine to drink with burgers.
Juicy citrus fruits and crisp acidity mark this wine. It's clean and versatile to drink with a wide variety of foods, from ham to fried chicken to veal parmesan.
The nose on this Chardonnay is quite attractive with notes of mango and musky florals accenting aromas of apples and sugar cookies. The dry, medium-bodied palate is a bit more subdued, with subtle apple and pear flavors accented with soft acidity. Finishes a bit short, but has a hint of spice.
Clean and expressive up front, with floral aromas shaped by doses of grass, apple and pear. Tastes very good, with condensed fruit creating a nice mouthfeel. Very long on the back end.
The wine is smoky with plenty of toastiness. At the same time, the bright red fruits are right up-front to give the wine its crispness and acidity. Drink this wine from 2018.
A near-perfect Albariño, bone dry, acidic and slightly green, with lime and mineral flavors. Totally cleanses the palate. A great cocktail sipper, or try with little Spanish-style tapas.
Seems somewhat Burgundian in its silky texture and elegant herbal notes—interesting given the French connections to the TapaNappa venture. Bright cherry fruit reflects the New World origins, with touches of cinnamon and clove rounding out the array of flavors. Delicate and lingering on the finish. Drink now.
Pinot Noir is a relative rarity in Washington, especially coming from this appellation. This one charms with abundant aromas of strawberry and sarsaparilla followed by an elegantly styled yet flavorful palate. One of the better examples coming from the state.
This easy-drinking red opens with pretty aromas of purple wild flower and red berry. The slim, simple palate offers tart sour cherry and orange zest alongside brisk acidity and angular, somewhat fleeting tannins.
Forest floor, new leather, tobacco and crushed herb aromas emerge in the glass. It's youthfully austere and a bit lean, with sour cherry, pomegranate, sage and white pepper framed in vibrant acidity and assertive fine-grained tannins. Drink 2023–2035.
The flint of the Rochoy vineyard gives off great heat, turning this into a ripe and complex wine. It is steely, with a strong mineral character, finishing with a wonderful, lifting acidity.
For the price, this Merlot packs a delicious punch, offering soft, persistent layers of chocolate, tar and leather, the tannins present yet well-managed. Red fruit and smoke intermingle on the palate, playing well together.
A tremendous value for the lush berry, currant and mocha flavors, finely grained tannins, and the way the wine feels so fine and rich in the mouth. Drink now with almost anything calling for a full-bodied and dry red wine.
Marred by unripe asparagus notes, this Syrah is tough to like despite its smooth tannins and some good blackberry and chocolate fruit.
You'll find aromas of forest floor, leather, graphite, chopped mint and an earthy whiff of soil on this elegant red. The structured, medium-bodied palate delivers dark cherry, raspberry compote, star anise, espresso and a toasted note. It's balanced, with firm close-grained tannins and fresh acidity. Drink 2019–2028.
Red-currant, strawberries and a touch of passion fruit almost give this a summer-cocktail vibe. It's very refreshing, with frothy, lively fizz. This wine spells party mood and is ideal for informal gatherings with its fun, off-dry and utterly fruit-driven nature.
Light and lemony, with a zippy mineral core that leaves the palate bright and refreshed.
A rich, complex style, with good concentration. There is some spice, along with citrus acidity and softness. It is immediately attractive, but also has pretensions to a more serious depth of flavor.
Tasted in a flight of other '04 Rutherford Cabs, this one was a little leaner and greener. There's a pepperminty sharpness alongside the cherry and cedar flavors. Best now and for a few years.
This Mourvèdre/Syrah blend has loads of wild berry and black cherry, spiced up with tarragon and other herbs. The Syrah fills in the middle with juicy berry and peppery spice. The tannins are balanced and firm, barky but not overpowering.
Reedy, herbaceous aromas suggest rhubarb and red licorice candy. This feels flat and lays heavily on the palate, while candied flavors of cherry and berry finish hot.
A smooth operator with sweet aromas of cotton candy, caramel and baked black plum. The palate is exceedingly flush yet refined, while the meaty flavor profile entails roasted berry fruit and herbs. Finishes with sweet, easy notes of caramel and toast. Drink now through 2013.
Iris, rose petal, fresh red berry and chopped mint aromas mingle together on this stunning red. The vibrant palate delivers crushed raspberry, red cherry, baking spice and star anise. Firm polished tannins provide structure and impeccable balance. Drink 2018–2028.
This Mendocino Syrah is concentrated, rich and savory, full of big dark-plum and blackberry flavors. The meat and white pepper notes go down smooth on the finish.
Crushed almonds, earth and a trace of honey and citrus mark the aromas. Then it turns fruity in the mouth and a tad sweet. It's a nicely balanced, apéritif-style wine for a fair price.
Technically, the wine is too soft and hot for balance, but it's so luscious, so enjoyable, you can't help but like it. The flavors just swarm all over the palate, offering cherries, blueberries, cola, violets, leather, bacon, carob and Asian spices, and the finish is satisfyingly complex and dry.
This powerful wine that also holds 5% Cabernet Franc shyly packs a punch. At first it comes off as elegant, soft and highly approachable. Faint notions of blackberry and black cherry are highlighted amidst a concentrated, tannic build.
A soft, creamy wine, lightly textured with pear and apple juice flavors. It's immediately attractive, a delicious wine for apéritifs.
With full oak and pineapple aromas along with a big mouthful of spicy apple and pear fruit, this is no weakling. On the contrary, it's full and meaty, with a lot of texture and extract. The feel is healthy even if the acidity is on the low side. A very good wine to drink now; it probably won't age that well.
This dry white enters the mouth on the grassy, feline side, then finishes rich in figs and pineapples. It has excellent acidity that leaves the palate feeling clean and refreshed. Will be versatile with a wide range of fare.
This fascinating wine is bone dry and tart in acids, with citrus, melon, fig and gooseberry flavors that finish with a rich spiciness. Be careful not to chill it too much. You might even want to decant it for a while before refrigerating. It gets better as it breathes in the glass.
One of the properties managed by Georges Vigouroux, this is located on the plateau, close to eastern edge of Cahors. The wine is rich, smooth and broad. A strong tannic structure is masked by the big, rounded black fruits and acidity. That makes for a wine that can be drunk soon, although it will be better from 2017.
This brand offers excellent value across the board, and this Zinfandel competes strongly with much more expensive bottlings. The balanced nose offers hearty blackberry, roasted meat, charcoal, violet and black pepper. The dark fruit and purple flowers of the palate are offset by gravelly minerality and dark chocolate flavors.
Here's a Pinot to drink now. It's a little on the soft, simple side, but tasty, with raspberry and cherry jam, cola, oak and spice flavors.
Sottimano makes five expressions of Barbaresco and this wine from the Pajoré cru delivers surprisingly ripe aromas of cherry, wild berries, white truffle, chopped herbs and drying mineral. It's an elegant and refined wine with noticeable acidity and a sharp finish, yet the 2007 summer heat shows up in the wine's flavors and fleshy aromas.
Amador Foothill does a good job with Sangiovese, and this dry rosé is made from that variety. It's a cheerful wine, brisk in acidity and with delicate but complex cherry, rose petal and lavender flavors. The winemaker recommends bouillabaisse, which is a pretty good suggestion.
Rich stone fruit adds to the pleasure of this lemon and arugula-scented white that manages to remain crisp despite its inviting and luscious ripeness.
Here's one for the cellar. It's a big, dry, muscular wine, assertive in tannins, with mineral-driven blackberry and black currant flavors. Muscular and intense, it should provide great drinking starting in 2015 and for many years after. A very great expression of its vineyard, which is basically the old Beringer State Lane Vineyard.
Green-apple skins and grapefruit rinds introduce the nose of this wine, followed by a bit of tropical papaya and melon. The palate show more apple skin and tangy lime as well as a tight minerality.
Floral, oily aromas are not typical of Chardonnay. A plump, melony mouthfeel is chunky, while this wine tastes both tropical and bitter, with a bath-soap character.
Kreydenweiss' unusually oxidative vinification methods are better suited to making a sweet wine such as this Vendanges Tardives, where we expect more savory flavors and less fresh fruit. The dominant notes here are caramel, cider and Asian spices, supported by a bright line of acidity that carries the flavors through to the lingering finish. Drink now.
This has been the winery's best Pinot Noir, and it shows its superiority once again in the richness and excellent structure. Appeals immediately for intricate raspberry, cherry, mineral and sandalwood flavors, then further inspires for the complex tannin and acid interplay. These mountain Pinots age well. Drink now–2015.
This well-priced white wine is simple and clean with fruit-driven aromas of peach, melon and honey. You can taste sweet notes from the strong sunshine and the wine has good density and firmness throughout.
Ripe, full bodied and jammy, this is a simple, country-style Cabernet, with berry-cherry flavors.
A blend of half and half Chardonnay and Aligoté, this is a mineral textured wine that is shot through with acidity and green fruits. It is crisp, light and bright, and refreshingly ready to drink.
This is a soft, rich and ripe wine that is full of red fruits. It has well-integrated tannins and a warm, southern feel of generous fruitiness. The wine is deliciously ready to drink now.
This opens with rather funky aromas of barnyard and game. The rustic aromas carry over to the palate along with overripe black-skinned berry, orange peel and grilled herb. Firm tannins provide structure.
There's always something magical about Gaja's Sorì San Lorenzo. It's the intensity and fullness of the wine that penetrates to the back of the palate and offers many long minutes of persistency on the finish. The bouquet is redolent of black fruit, leather, spice, tar, licorice and dried herb.
First created in 1992, this international blend is a fine contribution to Bordeaux-style wines around the world. Cabs and Merlot are the basis, and the relatively cool conditions of 2004 have given a delicate, elegant wine, with fresh black berry fruits.
A dark, jammy explosion of baked red fruit and blackberry, this is marked by its toasty oak and its subtle hint of bacon, benefitting from breathing for 10–20 minutes before drinking. Full in body and tannin, it has a vanilla-infused finish.
This Sauvignon Blanc boasts lively acidity, and flavors of citrus peel and white pepper. Has a tiny bit of spritz on the palate, followed up by nectarine flavors on the finish.
It's fun to rattle off a few of the numerous aromas and flavors in this exotic but subtle wine: tangerine, pastry cream, blanched almonds and a touch of honey. The wine is refreshing, dry and nicely braced with acidity, but at the same time rather broad and soothing in texture. In other words, beautifully balanced and wonderfully complex.
Simple but fresh and appealing, this offering—made in conjunction with Washington State's Chateau Ste. Michelle—is a light, entry-level Ries ling filled with green apple and citrus flavors. Drink now.
Hugely dry, tannic wine that is going to need several years aging. But the structure and balance are there, along with dark berry flavors, mixed with a firm, mineral character. This is powerful stuff.
This blend of Shiraz, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Merlot has aromas of cherry, vanilla and a whiff of lifted eucalyptus. It conveys flavors of black cherry, red plum and dried herbs. Medium bodied, it has a persistent finish.
Made from one of the great white grapes of Portugal (perhaps in the world), this rich wine, with its floral character, ripe yellow fruits and touches of wood and toast, is impressive and opulent. It has intense fruit flavors and light acidity to give them freshness. The wine is still young now, so enjoy from 2017.
This is a perfumed fruity wine. With its bright acidity and citrus and lychee flavors, it is both crisp and ripe. Ready to drink now.
Smooth and creamy, this is round, ripe and attractively cut with acidity. It has white fruit flavors, pears and red apples giving ripeness. A light touch of toastiness adds further interest. Drink now.
This is a soft, simple wine that tastes like a fruit juice blend of pineapples, oranges and mangoes. It's a little sweet.
Minty, with easy wintergreen, cherry and sandalwood flavors framed in stiff tannins. This blend of Dolcetto, Refosco and Nebbiolo needs rich beef dishes.
This is an engaging, nervy wine, with a light, savory aroma and tangy red-cherry flavors riding on a firm frame of fine-grained tannins and good acidity. It does not try to overwhelm with superripe fruit or oak, but just lets the purity of the grapes shine through.
This is sweet Amontillado in fine form. The nose is centered around a core of molasses and brown sugar, while the palate bubbles with maple and toffee. Yes, it's a sweeter-styled Amontillado, but the sugar fades on the palate, leaving only the complex residue of caramel, espresso and burnt cinnamon. A lovely wine for any fan of serious Sherry.
Sleek and savory, this blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc opens with aromas of mocha, spicy plum, scorched earth and leather. The juicy palate offers black currant, cassis, black pepper, savory herb and licorice alongside polished tannins.
Extraordinarily rich, offering massive blackberry and cherry jam, red currant, licorice, balsam, bitter chocolate and red pepper flavors. It's very tannic, but seems overly soft, and probably best now, so drink up.
You wouldn't know it unless you read the fine print on the back label, but this is from the estate vineyard of Rubicon, Francis Ford Coppola's winery. The wine is rich and complex and quite delicious. It has the mouthfeel of a fine Cab, but the flavor profile is all Zin: savory wild forest berries, tobacco, nettles, anisette, Dr. Pepper and a peacock's tail finish of Asian spices.
This shows dark concentration, with dense aromas of sweet cherry, tobacco, prune and blackberry. On the palate, it delivers a ripe impression of sweetness and a soft, plush texture.
Azelia's San Rocco Barolo is a stupendous wine with impressive intensity and generous aromas of wild berries, licorice, white truffle, menthol, spice, tar and leather. The tannins are firm and polished and the wine fades slowly leaving a pretty vanilla aftertaste. Hold until 2018. A Marc de Grazia selection; various American importers.
Quite funky, with roasted berry and earth aromas along with burnt grass, tar and leather. Very sweet and syrupy, without a whole lot of zest. Is it losing steam or what? Seems to have core qualities and nicely integrated tannins but it lacks the overt fruit and purity of the best Chilean Cabs. Imported by Global Vineyard Importers.
Aromatically intriguing, this carries suggestions of sour cherry, umami and fresh tobacco. The palate brings medium-bodied cranberry and cherry flavors. It doesn't have the tannic structure that this variety is known for but there is still plenty to enjoy.
A little on the sweet side, but crisp acidity provides a clean whisk of tartness, and the lemon-cream and orange flavors are absolutely delicious.
Traditional Rioja aromas of leather, vanilla, dried red fruits, spice and dill turn earthy with airing. This is healthy but mature on the palate, with oaky flavors of vanilla accenting core pie cherry, red plum and raspberry. Oak spice and acidity reverberate on the finish. Drink now.
From one of the leading estates in Listrac, this is a ripe structured wine. It has firm tannins and a dark core of dry wood aging. Balanced with that is the blackberry fruit and generous superripe Merlot. The wine needs time, so don't drink before 2019.
A medium-weight Chard with mainstream attributes: toasty oak, ripe pears and a plump, custardy mouthfeel. Finishes with a bit of alcoholic warmth.
This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon hails from a three-acre block of the winery's estate. Muted somewhat in terms of fruit, it offers instead ample amounts of smoky oak and herb, the tannins firm and generous.
Based on our tastings, this winery fared well in the heat of 2003. Sure, this federspiel is full and lush--more like a smaragd, but if you put that aside, what is in the bottle excels. Honts of pepper, smoke, honey, melon and nectarine give great complexity, while the long finish drives home with a firm edge honed in peppery spice.
Cola, black licorice, cherry liqueur and rum cake presage loads of ripe fruit and power. Yet it's lean and compact on the finish, with bright acidity that would pair well with pecorino stagionato or any aged cheese.
Underbrush, truffle, baking spice, leather and tobacco aromas segue over to the smooth full-bodied palate along with raspberry jam, licorice and clove. Seasoned polished tannins provide elegance and structure. Drink through 2027.
Ripe black cherry and vanilla swirl around notes of cedar and dusty tannins, combining seamlessly on the palate. From an appellation not known for the variety, it does justice to mountain fruit and power, finishing with substance.
Dark and plum-colored, the aromas suggest green, herbal fruit. In the mouth it tastes soft, stripped, over filtered; yet finishes with awkward, astringent green tannins and a lingering bit of alcoholic heat.
This medium-bodied Sauvignon Blanc doesn't have the lush tropical fruit of some versions, or the sharp pungency of others. What it does have is a balanced, minerally mouthfeel and crisp, citrusy flavors ideal for matching with simple seafood dishes.
This Syrah-led blend offers a moderately intense nose, with berry and cassis aromas along with herb and spice notes. It's full and structured, but not a bulldozer, and the flavors of baked berry, cassis, herb and chocolate are excellent. It's very smooth and heady, with lots of complexity. Drink now–2016.
Toasted oak, coffee and vanilla lead the nose and carry over to the palate along with dense cherry extract and espresso. Raspy wood tannins leave an astringent, abrupt finish.
A beautiful color, sort of a peach blush orange-pink, suggesting richness. And there it is in the mouth, an explosion of raspberries, strawberries, limes and honey. Definitely on the sweet side, but balanced with clean sparkling acidity. Nice with sushi.
This tastes like a cool-climate Zin because of the deep plum and black cherry flavors and light earthy, herbal accents, with touches of cedar and toast in the bouquet. It has moderate tannins and medium-to-full body.
This Chardonnay pays homage to the winemaker's wife and business partner, Rae Lee, who unfortunately passed away from breast cancer in 2009. This is an enjoyable showing, displaying lemon and peach tones over a core of creamed corn. Having spent six months in neutral French oak, the palate shows a bit of breadth, balanced by lively acidity.
Consistently among the best $20-and-under wines each vintage, this blend of 52% Grenache, 44% Syrah and 4% Tempranillo from vintner Dan Lee delivers plump boysenberry, plum, baking spice and rosemary scents on the nose. The palate is dry and herbal yet bright with acidity, full of thyme and sagebrush notes against a backdrop of plum fruit.
Earthen, savory tones of dusty mineral on the nose open to tart sour cherry and strawberry on the palate of this semi-dry rosé made from Merlot grapes. It's light bodied and zesty but balanced with a hint of sweetness.
Raspberry, rose petal, baking spice, tilled soil and new leather aromas unfold on this structured red. The chewy, full-bodied palate doles out juicy wild cherry, menthol and dark cooking spice while assertive tannins and fresh acidity lend balance. Drink 2019–2029.
Good Pinot Noir for the price. It's a little soda-poppy, with raspberry and cherry pie flavors, but the acidity is brisk, and the mouthfeel is nice and silky.
Vibrant and open on the nose, revealing scents of vanilla, mint and ripe cherries. For its modest price, this is surprisingly creamy and opulently textured, bursting with cherry and vanilla flavors. Drink now.
Lightly colored and tightly wound, this wine offers a bouquet of rose petals around a core of cherry and cranberry with buoyant acidity. A low oak profile helps boost the fruit-forwardness and approachability of the wine, with just a tiny bite of tannin on the finish.
You'll find direct Pinot cherry, raspberry and vanilla flavors in this delicate, crisp rosé. It's a fine, silky wine, not especially complicated, but appealingly easy.
Lots of sweet fruit is right up front here—super ripe berry/cherry flavors—that quickly fade and leave a rather dull finish. It's two thirds Cabernet Franc, the rest a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and just a splash of Petit Verdot.
Crisp and full of red fruits, this is a balanced wine. With its tannins well tamed and integrated with the fruit, this is going to be a fruity easy wine. Drink from 2018.
A solid, straightforward, all-purpose Pinot Gris, this offers firm and spicy pear and apple fruit, some crisp phenolics giving it a racy edge, and a little bite to the back of the palate. It has the acidity to stand up to creamy pasta sauces or soft cheeses.
Simple and fruity, with spearmint, peach and fig flavors that drink slightly sweet, although there's good balancing acidity. Good for everyday fare.
This is an easygoing lighter-style Dolcetto. Cherry and mocha flavors predominate throughout, and the finish is long and dry. Would go well with pizza.
A pale onion-skin color sets the stage for this light, fresh and fruity wine. It has red-fruit flavors, lively acidity and a soft, ready-to-drink character. Refreshing without great depths.
To judge by the blast of white pepper and strong tannins, the Northern Rhône is the model for this dry, single-vineyard wine. It is a distinguished Syrah, but too tannic and closed down now for thorough enjoyment. Best to cellar for 3 or 4 years, maybe longer, until it throws some sediment.
Here's a big, rich, tannic Syrah that's full bodied and dense, and exploding with blackberry, currant, mocha, cedar and spice flavors. Notable for its tannin structure, it's clearly made from well-grown grapes, and balanced in structure. It's resistant now, however, holding its best under a cloak of astringency. Should begin to mellow around 2015 and really take off through 2020.
Early sulfur and rotten-egg aromas are none too attractive, but in the mouth the wine is better. While sweet as sin, the soft, lush palate is a chocolate-lover's dream, and the finish is like mocha ice cream. Low acidity makes the structure sort of weak, but drink it now and that may not matter.
Simple and fruity, with bright cherries and blackberries that carry right through the palate and onto the finish. Slightly creamy in texture, with just a hint of tea leaf to keep things interesting. Drink now.
There are no complaints with this Chardonnay. Apple, pineapple, butter and toasted oak load the flavor package. The perfect balance and velvety mouthfeel provide a solid background. The producer recommends kangaroo tail soup with this one—but why not? You get to go to Australia, and kangaroo is low in fat and cholesterol. Best Buy.
From the Gonnets of Font de Michelle in Châteauneuf-du-Pape, this is the family's entry-level wine from an estate in the southern part of the Côtes du Rhône. The medium-bodied raspberry fruit is accented by hints of cracked pepper, dried spices and leather. It's supple enough to drink now and over the next 4–5 years.
Gulfi strikes again with overt aromas, this time settling on bread crust, cookie dough and pressed currant berry. The wine is broad and intense, and leaves a long-lasting impression in the mouth. Imported by Selected Estates of Europe Ltd.
This is Ferrari-Carano's most upscale wine, a blend comprised of all five of the famous Bordeaux varieties. It's as lush and intricate as almost anything out of Napa, with sumptuous blackberry, black currant and cedar flavors. The giveaway that it's Sonoma comes in the herbaceousness and slightly greener tannins. Now–2013.
A perplexing wine to evaluate, Cullen's 2004 flagship red is a medium-weight blend of 84% Cabernet Sauvignon, 13% Merlot and 3% Cabernet Franc. It's fruit-forward, with bright cherry and cassis notes, but is there enough stuffing behind that to balance the moderately astringent tannins? Give it 3–5 years and see if it blossoms.
Floral blackberry aromas are concentrated. The saturated palate is somewhat narrow in breadth, while boysenberry and minty oak flavors rank as dark. A wiry but juicy finish is lasting and offers a note of chocolaty oak.
La Vota is a Cabernet Sauvignon from a hot climate that surprises the palate with its crisp, green aromas. There's a touch of soya, wasabi, bramble and forest floor. But you'll also recognize wild berry and toasted almond.
Stalky, short aromas suggest that this is raw and underripe. The palate feel confirms that impression; it's tight and choppy, with drying tannins. Roasted, gritty flavors of red fruits come with a sprinkle of cocoa, while the finish is tough in feel, spicy and ultimately mildly bitter.
Salon's releases are rare and signify a great vintage—the last release was the 2002. Coming from grand cru vineyards in Le Mesnil-sur-Oger, this 2004 is complex and concentrated, capturing the essence of Chardonnay in Champagne. Intense minerality and ripe apple and citrus fruits accompany the purity and crisp texture that are part of its ability to age. The wine can continue for many years, certainly to 2025 and beyond.
An incredibly savory nose of hoisin-glazed barbecue, with a hint of tarragon, carries the bouquet. More fruit comes on the palate of jammy, mixed black berries, yet the mild acidity struggles to keep the balance.
Deeply embedded in firm tannins, this is a wine for aging. There is plenty of mineral, black currant and plum juice fruit, with a fine juicy element as well as acidity. It is balanced and harmonious, a keeper for 5–6 years.
Lush and luscious, this is a standout among the 2009 Erath Pinots. The richness of the fruit gives this zaftig wine immense appeal, with deep cherry flavors streaked with gun metal, anise, mocha, and coffee. A lick of dark chocolate ensures a glorious finish.
Upfront citrus, tropical fruit, peach and apple flavors mark this rich Chardonnay, plus notes of buttered toast and caramel. The opulence is balanced by crisp acidity and stony minerality.
The merest hint of pineapple hovers above the glass. This leads onto a full-fruited generous and fizzy palate of ripe mirabelle plum. It is exuberant with big bubbles of joy. Freshness is evident in the lemony tartness which provides a welcomed balance.
Well-done in a very exuberant style, with blackberry jam and tar notes layered over animal scents and wood ash. The palate is concentrated and mouthwatering, winding down to a lingering raspberry finish. Serve with hearty fare. May improve with a year or two in the cellar.
Light salmon in color, this herbal rosé dances on the palate with a slight effervescence and 5% residual sugar. It offers a bouquet of robust red fruit and rose petal aromas, and saw no oak.
Juicy and fruity, this black currant-flavored wine is supported by some dry tannins. It's a wine for the medium-term with its hints of wood and a touch of more bitter extraction at the end.
Eric Dunham's Lewis vineyard Syrah belongs near the top of anyone's list of the best in the country. The brilliant nose opens with bright, inviting raspberry, blueberry and boysenberry scents and flavors. The wine is forward, intense and nuanced. Immediately, brilliantly appealing, it has the power and balance to age for up to a decade.
This is a big wine, and not really showing its best now. It's raw-boned. The oak is all smoky and spicy and dominant; the fruit is massive in pears, crunchy apples and pineapples; the acidity on the finish is tart. It needs a year or so to knit together.
Known for his Pinots and Chards, Rick Longoria tried hard with this red, even though Santa Barbara has struggled with Bordeaux. Wisely, Longoria bases the wine on Cabernet Franc and Merlot, which do better in cooler climates than Cabernet Sauvignon. The wine is fine, rich and promising.
A simple red, with sharp acids that give an edgy cut to the mouthfeel. This would be a fine pizza wine, or good with grilled sausages.
De Loach reaches into Lake County, not usually thought of as Zinfandel country, with tremendous results. This is a great wine by any standard. It shows some heat from high alcohol and some shriveled raisin tastes, but that's part of a ripe Zin's charm. Mostly, you'll be impressed by waves of sweetly ripe berries, chocolate and bacon, smooth tannins and a long, spicy finish.
Starts with rubbery, intense aromas, but with breathing it settles on earthy berry fruit and oak-driven coffee. The mouthfeel is good and shows nice lemony acids, while the flavors vascillate between tangy/floral and herbal blackberry. Sweet, concentrated and rich on the finish, with a lasting wave of mocha.
Smoky, rubbery aromas of berry and cassis are lightly herbal. This has a firm mouhtfeel with piercing acidity. Salty, briny plum and berry flavors lead to a finish that holds onto the saline notes and feels crisp.
There's a good touch of vanilla as well as ripe fruits in this wine. It is rounded, soft and fresh, hinting at a richer side with melon and apricot flavors. It's young, drinkable now, but better from 2016.
This is packed with oaky, masculine aromas of black fruit, bacon, moss and leather, but in the mouth it's rough as nails, with heavy tannins propping up flavors of blackberry, baked plum, herb and smoke. It finishes earthy and toasty, with thick tannins and ruggedness. Drink now with beef.
Fruity, pure and smooth on the nose, and maybe more dry and leathery than the blasting Nicasia vineyard wine. The palate has a deep, classy elegance along with power, and the flavors run toward huge black fruits, coffee and chocolate. Finishes dark, long and minerally, and overall it's yet another awesome top-flight Malbec from this world-class winery. Drink now through 2014.
Made from six varieties, mainly Rhône, this is a soft, simple wine that tastes medicinal.
This Bordeaux-style blend is comprised of 44% Cabernet Sauvignon, 43% Merlot and 13% Cabernet Franc. The fruit flavors of raspberry and blackberry are light and tangy, the tannins mellow. A note of dark chocolate highlights the finish.
Wild berry, red rose, baking spice and a balsamic note meld together in the glass. The structured, savory palate doles out juicy wild cherry, crushed raspberry, anise, cinnamon and tobacco. Bracing but refined tannins provide the framework. Drink 2018 through 2026.
A rooty-smelling nose suggests sarsparilla soda, with accents of oak, malt and baked blackberry. There's just enough energy to the ripe palate, which tastes of earthy, savory blackberry, baking spices and cola nut. A smooth, ready finish revolves around surprisingly soft tannins. Drink this easy rider through 2022.
This organic Prosecco is very focused on soapy, floral aromas that recall lavender honey, honeysuckle and ripe melon. But it also has pretty opulence, or roundness despite its spicy acidity.
A beautifully balanced wine, the ripe, lightly sweet fruit blending well with fresh strawberry acidity, intense pear and an aftertaste that leaves an elegant weight in the mouth.
This is an attractive, fruity wine, crisp and fresh. It has delicious acidity with a touch of strawberry and a lightly mineral texture.
Visión has good peach, apricot and other stone fruits on a largely quiet nose, while the palate is surprisingly spry and tangy as it tastes like lemon-lime and pineapple. Finishes long and acid-washed, so overall it seems zesty and jumpy.
With only 15 cases imported, this might be a hard find but certainly worth the trouble. A blend of 70% Sémillon and 30% Sauvignon Blanc, ripe red apple flesh and pear aromas and flavors are jazzed up with sweet spice and soft buttered toast accents. Round and full but not overly heavy thanks to lifting tropical fruit-like acidity.
This has rich, ripe fruit and signs of wood aging that are appropriate to a young wine, but they will certainly become integrated. What is so delicious about this selection is the fine balance between its generous fruit and its tight, minerally acidity. Keep this for at least six years.
Charred, smoky, herbal aromas of blackberry trend in the direction of exotic before showing barrel-driven scents of vanilla and clove. This exhibits plenty of depth and sponginess along with toasty, herbal flavors of plum and blackberry. Pepper, burnt toast, clove and blueberry flavors carry the finish on this hefty Malbec; drink through 2021.
Fairly simple Chardonnay, with toned-down fruit, cream, sweet buttered toast and vanilla flavors. The price is fair for what you get.
This attractive, well-balanced and deeply concentrated wine is also affordable. It wraps fine-grained tannins around a fruity core, making this medium-bodied wine full in flavor.
A very nice Cab, rich and textured and soft, with intricate flavors of cherries, blackberries, currants, mocha and toasty, smoky oak and vanilla. Notable for its tannins, which are very fine. Great now and through 2012 or so.
87-89 Barrel sample. Very ripe, almost sweet fruit gives this wine a delicious, open, generous feel. Red fruits are the dominant character, layered with some spicy new wood that develops at the end.
Leather, burnt bush and leafy, green Cabernet aromas get it off the mark in questionable fashion. The palate offers some berry flavor but it's chewy, buttery and off-center. Not a whole lot going for it.
Rich and alluring with notes of ripe stone fruit, baked apple and a drizzle of chestnut honey throughout. Full and viscous in the mouth but lifted by crisp acidity that follows through to the clean but long finish.
This wine costs a lot for what it's giving. The nose starts out hard and fruitless, and while the aromas come around, the wine always holds onto its corn and haystack character. Zippy acidity gives the mouth zest, and it also livens up papaya, banana and apricot flavors. Complex and different, but does it taste good enough to justify a $78 price tag?
Lots of briary wild blackberry, cherry and exotic spice flavors in this Zin, with cola, tobacco and mushu plum sauce complexities, and the finish is dry. Compromised by a hit of sharp acidity, but rich barbecue will help.
Out of the gate this wine reveals quite savory aromas of stems, fire pit, soot, black olive and light flowers. The flavors are intense and tightly wound, showing a lot of structure along with elegance. It's a flat out stunner, showing grace and power as well as a hyper-extended finish.
This is a soft and ripe wine with acidity plus yellow and pineapple fruit flavors. A gentle texture gives freshness and a tang of lemon zest. Drink now.
Somewhat soft and jammy. While it's certainly delicious, this 100% Cabernet needs greater structure and complexity to add value to the sweet blackberries, cherries and chocolate.
Aromas of citrus, especially white grapefruit and lime, are spunky and sweaty like Sauvignon Blanc or Verdejo. A solid, fleshy palate is home to a mix of citric and tropical flavors, while the finish reverts back to grapefruit, with a monotone feel. This is Macabeo, Garnacha Blanca and Pedro Ximénez.
Fallen from the sky is the name of this wine, alongside a child's drawing of a spaceship. The wine itself is more earthbound, soft and with forward ripe fruitiness. Red berries and plums are right up there alongside plenty of acidity. Drink this easy wine now.
Light and simple, this is all about fruit and freshness. There is a hint of citrus, and the acidity shows well on the finish. More of an aperitif style.
A blend of 60% Pinot Noir, 30% Chardonnay and 10% Pinot Meunier, this is a light, fresh wine, well developed already, with ripe fruit from a classic Champagne year. The acidity is already moving toward toastiness.
This structured blend of Chardonnay, Sauvignon, Picolit and Moscato Giallo offers aromas of toasted oak, ginger and orchard fiuit. The elegant palate combines Golden Delicious apple, mature apricot, oak-driven spice and candied nectarine zest alongside tangy acidity.
White floral aromas are pure and fresh in this apple-inflected Romanian Riesling. Soft on the palate, with restrained acidity and a delicate, almost lacy structure, it finishes with a hint of powdered sugar sweetness.
This comes from a producer based in the Marne Valley, so it is not unusual to find a 100% Pinot Meunier wine. It gives great fruitiness, apples and crisp pears as well as bright, ready-to-drink acidity.
A gold colored wine, this is a medium-sweet white Port with maple syrup and toffee flavors balanced by fresh acidity. It would make a great cocktail base or can be drunk chilled on its own.
Strange on the nose, with hints of cat box, crushed vitamins, iodine and yeast. Quite rubbery and pithy on the palate, with papaya, green melon and some vegetal notes. And it's spritzy across the tongue. Imported by Supreme Wines & Spirits.
From a bottling that has some toasty maturity, this is a rounded wine. Almond and apple flavors balance each other to produce a ripe and smoothly soft selection. It has notes of toast and mushroom, as well as ripe, lime-driven acidity on the finish.
Gold in color, this is a wine with notes of spice, rich fruit and honey, which are all surrounded by intense botrytis. This is a wine that has great aging potential, and its superripeness develops slowly on the palate.
Here is a beautifully rendered, vividly fruity Washington Riesling. Crisp green apple flavors combine with succulently sweet citrus in a classic, off-dry style.
A little crusty and candied on the nose, but in due time it finds its stride. Flavors of plum, tea and fresh herbs are true to the variety, and the palate feel is ripe yet balanced, while the finish is long and steady. With lots of fruit and a hint of chocolate, this ranks as a good, recommended Carmenère. Imported by Ecovalley Quality Wine Group and National Refrescos Import Company, LLC.
A funky nose of wet dog and medicinal cherry is no place you want to begin. The palate is high in acidity and scratchy, with tart plum, berry and cheek-starching tannins. Tastes reasonably good but fails in the bouquet and mouthfeel departments.
A huge Graciano is what this is. Hailing from Toledo, this 16% abv heavyweight is seriously fruity and massive on the nose, with a mash-up of blackberry, boysenberry and peppery aromas. Layered blackberry, cassis and blackened toast flavors finish much the same, with juicy, edgy acidity. Drink through 2021.
Mildly minty, grassy and lactic, but also sweet, jammy and good for a cool-climate red wine. Having not been real happy with the new wave of reds from Limarí, this one shows good marmalade, balsamic, pepper and other savory fruit flavors. It's thick and long late, with some grab and width. Imported by Ecovalley Quality Wine Group and National Refrescos Import Company, LLC.
You might almost think this is a Pinot Noir, it's so silky, crisply acidic and rich in raspberries, cherries, red licorice and sandalwood. That this is a nearly six-year-old Syrah is a surprise, but a pleasant one. It would not have been possible for this wine to taste this young if it weren't from a cool-climate appellation. Shows the potential of Santa Maria Valley Syrah capable of aging.
This classic, restrained rosé offers a wave of lemon, cherry and strawberry on the nose and refreshing, crisp berry flavors on the palate. Acids and fruit are very well balanced and the wine finishes clean with a slight spin of sugar. Very pretty and a great everyday sipper.
Here's a robust and jammy selection that offers assertive notes of black plum, blackberry and cassis on the nose and in the mouth. The texture is like crushed velvet, with additional nuances of licorice, fruitcake spice and light char, adding depth to the palate and length to the finish.
Entirely estate-grown, 100% Merlot from old vines, this unfined wine is labeled vegan. Plush, briary, brambly fruit from the 30 year old vineyard brings an extra dimension to the wine, which shows a lovely balance of cranberry, raspberry, pie cherry and baking spice flavors. There's a hint of pastry crust in the finish, which is seamless and long. An absolute delight.
A steely mix of raspberries and cherries frames the core fruit with tart citrus. There's a hint of gunmetal, along with tight well-ripened tannins. Solid winemaking all around.
Attractive deep lemon color. Quite pronounced mineral nose with layered aromas of honied stone fruit salad with fusel, balsamic, floral and earthy notes. Taut palate, yet juicy with mouthwatering citrus, peach and apricot flavors. Strong minerality follows through to a long juicy finish.
Medicinal cherry and plum aromas are smothered in milk chocolate scents that turn more animal and leathery with airing. The palate is chunky but dull in feel, with generic red-berry flavors covered with candied oak and herbal notes.
This opens with fleshy black cherry, leather and baking spice aromas, feeling just as concentrated on the palate. Black plum, vanilla and tobacco flavors are supported by ripe, firm tannins. Drink through 2023.
Limited production (just 1,800 cases) and special handling (native yeast, barrel fermented, lot selection) make this the prestige Chardonnay offering from the entire Ste. Michelle portfolio. Much of the fruit is from original (1973) plantings at the Cold Creek vineyard, and gives the wine depth and resonance. This vintage has had plenty of time to absorb the new oak and integrate the flavors, and is drinking beautifully.
There's a nice grab of dry tannins in the midpalate, with mixed plum and earth flavors. The nose holds pencil eraser and some outdoorsy aromas: tree bark, earth, maybe a little leaf. A well-done wine, particularly for the price. Made by Shingleback's winemaker, John Davey.
A wine that takes a delightful detour from the more typical rounded Chenin style, this bright, zippy wine has lovely tropical fruit flavors and a refeshing finish. Despite its cheerful character it's also quite intense and layered. Enjoy with more delicate dishes like light salads, or sip on its own.
Juicy black fruit stars in this lush, expansive red, nicely priced for the appellation and providing great value for the quality. Violets appear on the nose, softening the length of tannin and toasted oak that follow.
A fine companion to the winery's Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a smooth mix of plums, black cherries, tobacco and spice. It's knitted together beautifully, with highlights of cinnamon.
This rather lightweight kabinett is entirely in character for its classification. Even if many 2007 kabinetts are bigger and richer, Bastgen's offers finely detailed flavors of honey, melon, peppery spice and crushed stones. Great apéritif wine.
Smells honeyed and tastes like one of those fruity bottled sodas. It's a riot of peaches, pears and vanilla cream, with a honey-sweet finish.
This eclectic mix of 42% Chardonnay, 28% Viognier, 19% Petit Manseng and 11% Pinot Gris smells a bit muddled, bearing notes of peach, apricot and the paper-thin crust of caramelized sugar on a crème brûlée. It feels easy-going and unassuming, lacking some depth, but would be a good wine to pair with honey-glazed grilled chicken.
Inebriating aromas of hearty tobacco, black earth, cassis and prune kick off another barrel-aged monster from Dave Corey. The cherry syrup and plum liqueur flavors remain bright with strong acidity as well as sturdy tannic structure, meaning this one will last until 2020 at least.
A blend of Conner Lee and Stillwater Creek vineyard fruit, this carries tart, wild berry flavors on a sea of bright acidity. Streaks of anise and a touch of floral aromatics add zest and interest.
The nose is secretive but the palate shows structure and poise. There is freshness and brisk, tart redcurrant fruit with some concentration, plesantly unexpected grip and lovely firmness. It's a light but impressive Pinot.
Light and fruity with pineapple, melon and apple. This fruit forward, food-friendly wine has natural acids and a delicate balance. For the money it is a fine choice to accompany seafood, poultry and pasta salads.
If you cellar only a few Napa Cabernets a year, this is one you should seek out. It's so tannic, so shut down, yet so explosive in blackberries, currants, dark chocolate and sweet oak, that it will easily negotiate the next decade. If you really have to open it before 2015, at least give it a decent decant.
There's a whiff of cherry blossom perfume on this beautifully concentrated, elegantly structured Pinot from Silver Thread. On the palate, fleshy red fruit flavors are accented by vivacious acidity and a twinge of plum skin bitterness. Finishes bold with a coating of furry tannins.
Made in a lighter style, this Paso blend has cherry, red currant, violet and sandalwood flavors. There are some pretty hard tannins, but they're refined. Basically a Bordeaux blend with a splash of Syrah.
Pascal Bouchard's entry-level Chablis is a wine that is tank fermented, preserving its great fruitiness. The wine is certainly full of lemon, pear and orange-zest flavors. With its forward fruitiness it can be drunk now, but should hold well through 2019.
Plum, cherry and strawberry aromas are light, true and minerally. This is a juicy, fresh, medium-weight wine with plum and raspberry. Nothing about this is pushy; overall, it's a bright, lifted quaffer that's totally satisfying.
This is a clean, fruity, pleasant white wine that could just as easily be something along the lines of an Italian Orvieto rather than a Washington Sauv Blanc. Melon and cucumber, fresh acidity, and alcohol just a little over 13%.
Red-fruit aromas operate solo on the bouquet. This feels tight, crisp and fresh, with plum, berry and peppery spice flavors. A dry, slightly abrasive and scratchy finish deals juiciness and lasting red-fruit flavors.
A friendly and approachable Brunello with all its elements tucked neatly into place, Pinino offers ripe aromas of black fruit and toast. This wine is less complex, compared to past vintages, and would make a good companion to hearty pasta and roasted meats. The estate's long history spans back to 1874.
Plum, blue flower, baking spice and a whiff of French oak lead the nose along with new leather. The juicy palate shows both chewy concentration and finesse, doling out raspberry compote, ripe wild cherry, vanilla, dried rosemary and coffee alongside bright acidity and fine-grained tannins. Drink 2019–2027.
Bright black currant fruit, lively acidity and an easy layer of tannins—this wine is fresh, ripe and ready to drink.
The Courselle sisters, Marie and Sylvie, continue to boost their white style with the lovely blend of 50% Sémillon, 35% Sauvignon Blanc and 15% Sauvignon Gris. The wine is still developing, although it is already giving hints of its spice and ripe apple future. It is a full-bodied wine, only lightly textured. As it develops, it will add to its rich character.
This opens with aromas of toast, prune, scorched earth and chopped mint. The juicy palate offers dried black cherry, star anise and a hint of sweet baking spice alongside supple tannins. Straightforward and already approachable, it will offer enjoyable sipping in the near term. Drink through 2020.
Reduced and extracted, this old-vine wine is smooth and velvety, powerfully made to reflect rich, ripe red berry and a layering of brown sugar. The finish is lean and reminiscent of black licorice.
Quite tart and citrusy, this is a pleasant wine that offers clean and refreshing flavors of melon, grapefruit and gin. It's not an insubstantial wine, but it does not have the fleshy fruit that Willamette Valley Gris usually shows; this is a leaner style that's well suited to shellfish.
A black plum-extract character marks the nose of this wine from the folks behind Los Angeles' historic San Antonio Winery, but it's brown spice that dominates, particularly uncrushed cloves and anise seeds. Dried sour cherry and uncracked peppercorns show on the palate that is presented on rather chewy tannins.
A blend of Syrah and Petite Sirah, Shafer's Relentless is a testament to the winery's commitment to these varieties despite their domination of the Cab market. The wine shows the huge power and balance of Shafer's Cabernets, with a different flavor profile. It's soft and gentle but complex in ripe tannins, with blackberry, cherry, cassis, cola, red licorice, sweet tobacco and rich Asian spice flavors. Drink now through 2010.
Slightly smoky grilled-toast aromas lead into a plump medium-bodied wine filled with flavors of yellow plum, tangerine and lime. It's not particularly zesty or linear in a true cool-climate fashion, but steers clear of ripe tropical fruit, ending on a gentle note of citrus pith. Drink now.
This well-oaked offering has classic Cabernet aromas and flavors, with blackberry and cassis melding nicely with the heavy toast. The mouthfeel is full, even and plush, and the dark cherry and densely oaked finish is smooth and pleasing.
The Domaines Ott Chateau de Selle is a breed apart, with little of the effusive red fruit that we typically associate with Provence Rosés. The 2008 shows vanilla and butterscotch aromas that lead to a serious, medium-weight palate with good flavor intensity. Winds up on a lingering note of newly-mown hay. Drink now.
Slightly funky but appealing forest-floor aromas blend with black cherry and graphite on the nose of this Terravant creation. Soft on the palate, it shows raspberry, cherry extract and brown and black spices, with a hint of dragon's blood incense.

Pungent and herbal, with grassy notes that overlay bright lime fruit and a solid mineral base. Structured, this could age nicely over the next 5–8 years, much like a good Bordeaux blanc.
This blend of Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier feels a little scouring. It has sweet-tasting flavors of raspberry jam, toast, vanilla and yeast. Drink this bubbly now.
Seems a bit hard and lean for a ‘99, especially a reserve. Pretty tannic now, although there's some blackberry fruit at the core. Oak provides additional nuances of smoke and spice. Hard to tell where it's going.
This blend is 75% Cabernet Sauvignon with the rest Merlot and a pinch of Malbec. Woodspice aromas and flavors take the lead followed by an assortment of red and black-fruit flavors that seem a bit dried out. The tannins bring some grit.
This wine has excellent depth, concentration and an array of subtle spices that mingle with lightly toasted oak, ripe plum and mulled-cherry flavors. Good acidity and a tart edge to the fruit lend nice balance against the full, velvety texture and rich finish.
Firm and closed this is a dark and tannic wine, although black currant flavors are also very present. It feels austere with a mineral texture and concentrated final acidity. Drink Lafite's second wine from 2017.
The aromas are quite subdued with notes of herbs and red fruit. The flavors are more generous but still come off as quite light.
This is a fully unique expression of Nebbiolo with distinct aromas of bacon fat, dried salami, bresaola and playful accents of black fruit and exotic spice. The intensity and power are terrific and the wine is tart, chewy and bright on the close. That inherent freshness makes a nice contrast to those heavier meaty aromas.
A dark ruby Merlot with generous and well defined notes of cherry, strawberry roll-up, chocolate, soy sauce, toast and a spicy, succulent quality that is pleasantly complex and round on the palate.
In hommage to the man who pioneered the use of oak to ferment Sauvignon Blanc, this wood-fermented and matured wine is only produced in the best years. It is rich and just toasty, but equally about the structured mineral texture and ripe citrus. It is a wine to age, so drink from 2018.
Crisp and fresh, this has a bright bouquet of honey chopped herb and stone fruit. This simple sparkler would taste fantastic on a hot summer afternoon.

Red apple and brioche aromas are tinged with lemon. The palate has the same fruit, richness and freshness, but expresses this with lightness and ease. It's a versatile sparkler, ideal for both apéritif and dinner. The finish is dry, balanced and elegant.
Produced from vineyards donated to a charitable hospital in the 19th century, this wine is rich and now perfectly mature. It has smoky tannins that lie under the fine, elegant cherry and red plum fruits and acidity. The wine still has freshness although the attraction here is the ripe structure. The ornate label dates back to 1926.
A wine that reflects the relative lightness of the reds in this vintage. It has a layer of tannins, but they don't suggest aging; they are more a base for the attractive raspberry and red plum flavor, freshened by the acidity.
With its red currant fruit, this wine is softly structured and round with richness, finishing full-bodied and leathery.
This is a serious, organically grown wine, that's big, ripe and spicy with a great creamy texture. Very full in the mouth, it boasts rich yellow fruits laced with a chalky, mineral character. Acidity plays a pivotal role in keeping all this freshness in balance. Drink after 2–3 years. Screwcap.

One generally approaches a $15 Oregon Pinot Noir with extreme caution, but here is a lovely surprise. Clean, soft, balanced and reasonably varietal, this is as good a value as you will find in this price-driven state. The flavors are soft and supple, with butter and caramel streaks strongly evident. Don't look for big fruit, but what is there is crisp and clean.
A wealth of oak and tannin marks the entry of this wine, a blend of 62% Malbec with 30% Merlot, 6% Cabernet Franc and 2% Petit Verdot. It mellows on the midpalate, providing a more supple experience of baked plum, raspberry and coffee, finishing with a full-bodied flourish of vanillin toast.
Jammy but dilute, with plum and red licorice flavors. A bit of caramel and toffee come on late, but that only works to create a thick, fudge-like mouthfeel.

Peju's Merlots have been inconsistent. When they're good, they're quite good, but you never know. This 2008, from a less successful vintage, is all right. It's dry and tannic and soft in cherry and tobacco flavors. But there's not a lot going on. Drink up.
Pungent, borderline sweaty aromas of passion fruit, mango and orange peel are classic SB. This Rueda-based Sauvignon is zesty on the palate, with strict flavors of grapefruit, passion fruit and tangerine. A crisp, fresh, slightly pithy finish doesn't hurt.

A very crisp Chardonnay, with a high level of acidity to go with the white currant and green plum fruits. The wine is fruity and open, while kept tight by an apple skin texture. Screw cap.
Dark, soft, full-bodied and slightly sweet, this Pinot clearly shows its warm-climate origins. It tastes of jammy blackberries, cherries and raspberries.

From a mix of old indigenous white grapes, this wine reveals a producer making a stab at something different with character. It's broad and mouthfilling, framed by plenty of toasty oak and dried spices, but it also features honey and melon flavors that help support the wood.
This is an excellent follow-up to the fine 2010, showing similar qualities. Elegantly dry and zesty in acidity, it has savory flavors of lemons, limes and peaches, with a stimulating grassiness.

Good price for a sophisticated Cab you can substitute for more expensive bottlings without apologizing. The wine is rich in black currants, blackberry jam and spicy oak, accented by savory herbs and spices.
There's a subtle hint of green to this wine's light yellow color, but there's nothing subtle about green bean aromas that blast from the glass.

A bit too green but certainly intense, with a tart finish.
Thin, herbal, and tannic, this does not show much in the way of either varietal character or ripeness.
Fresh and vibrant, with hints of herbs and flowers alongside figs and citrus fruits. This is light in body but not light on flavor, although it does finish a bit short.

Finishes long, with a touch of warmth. Drink now–2015.

Good density here, with tannins that spring from bright berry fruits. The acidity is certainly present, but it has weight behind it, giving potential richness balanced by wood.

Has just enough complexity to serve with fine foods.
Snappy red berry aromas and some heat define the nose, while a lean, tight, acidic palate pushes forward with racy raspberry and cherry flavors. Clamps down on the finish, but always shows good zest and crispness.

Famed as a cult wine in Austria, this lives up to its billing. It is powerful but elegant, with juicy, herbal flavors, blackberries, damsons and a smooth, cocoa coating. But there is certainly structure here from the tannins. Like so many Triebaumer wines, this will age magnificently.
Rusty in color, with soft aromas of cherry and plum, this rosé of Trepat feels fleshy and round, with modest acidity. Briny citrus and charred cherry notes unfold on the finish.

Pungent and aggressive. The nose offers hints of hard cider and toast, while the palate is crisp and fresh. Good mouthfeel, but lacks depth of flavor.
A light pretty wine, this brings a mix of strawberry and Bing cherry front and center. There's no real density or complexity; the fruit is fresh and clean and follows through in a light consistent finish.

Ripe and juicy, this shows red fruits and soft, broad tannins. The fruity concentration gives it a generous feel. Keep for 2–3 years, or drink sooner.

Mainly Shiraz (87%), this is a meaty, savory and plummy red at a reasonable price. Hints of vanilla and cola impart additional complexity, while the mouthfeel is creamy, cushioned by ripe tannins. It drops off just a little on the finish, but it's still a very good drop for near-term consumption.
Rather unripe, with green mint and cherry flavors and a sharpness through the finish.
A little prickly and sharp on the nose, with cherry, raspberry and piney aromas. The palate is racy, healthy and solid, with wild herb notes giving character to more basic but ripe blackberry and oak-based coffee flavors. Finishes long and whole, with a final dusting of dried herbs.
A sleek name and a sleek wine. Vanilla and toffee overflow from the effusive nose while sour candy and plum jam take over on the palate. It's a tad thin in the mouth but finishes on a lovely raspberry note that has just a bit of sticking power. Drink as the Australians do, with Christmas dinner.
This opens with cherry and bitter almond aromas, offering a lean mouthfeel that simple and clean. It's the perfect partner to pepperoni pizza.
A pioneer in rosé Vinho Verde, this producer makes a dry wine and one of the few rosés from the region that really make sense. It is balanced with crisp red fruits as well as tight acidity and a shot of lemon. Drink now.
This estate wine has rich fruits that are totally balanced with the acidity and the ripe red fruit flavors. A crisp texture offers acidity and a full body. It will be even better by the end of 2014.
Made in the popular style, this Chardonnay features buttered popcorn, pineapple jam and buttered toast flavors. Turns cloyingly sweet on the finish.
Typcially rustic, as are most of Weinert's wines. Tree bark, earth and cola are apparent on the saucy, traditional bouquet, while the palate is a touch raw and herbal, with tomato and oregano accenting medium-weight red fruit. For some this is the right style; for others it won't do the trick. Imported by Broadbent Selections, Inc.
Totally herbaceous, it's full of green herb flavors and tight with citrus and gooseberry. A light touch balances the intensity, giving freshness to the wine that's ready to drink now.
Here's a likeable Chard, with peach, pear and fig flavors that have a distinctly herbal edge, like dried sage. Turns buttery and vanilla-y on the finish.
Almost black in color, this is a big, bold and rich ruby. Dark berry fruits are sustained by a sweet, jammy character. The tannins do give the wine structure, but the rich sweetness dominates. Drink now.
Earthy, medicinal plum and berry aromas are also a bit mulchy and leathery in character. A disjointed, tannic palate brings dry oak, medicinal berry and green flavors. Chocolate rises up on the finish of this full bodied Monastrell.
Edna Valley's cool maritime climate has led to a sharply acidic wine, intense and pure in Meyer lemon, ripe fig, Key lime pie and peppery guava flavors. The wine is dry and intensely fruity. A beautiful cocktail wine.
It leads with aromas of oak, menthol, blue flower and mature black fruit. The palate reveals dried black cherry buffered by sensations of sweet coconut and vanilla, alongside firm but astringent tannins. Reflecting the forward vintage, this is already way ahead of its years in terms of evolution. Drink through 2019.
Aromas of dark berry, iris, menthol and a whiff of oak emerge on this vibrant wine. Firmly structured but loaded with finesse, the palate delivers ripe Marasca cherry, crushed black raspberry, vanilla, savory mineral and thyme alongside fine-grained tannins. A licorice note wraps around the tight finish. This is still primary so be sure to give it time to fully develop. Drink 2025–2045.
This wine is dry, full and brimming with ripe red-berry fruits. A blend of Syrah and Touriga Nacional, it has a rich character that gives the wine more weight than freshness. Drink now.
This wine mostly hails from Les Collines, with a splash of fruit from Upland Vineyard (12%) rounding it out. Aged in neutral oak, it displays brooding aromas of black pepper, plum, smoked meat, parsley and fresh violets. The plum and savory flavors bring a rich textured feel all the while displaying exquisite freshness.
Huge flavors of jammy blackberries and cherries dominate this Syrah, with a coating of sweet, caramelized oak. It's yummy, but not especially complex. Drink now.
Encased in what seems to be the world's biggest bottle, this wine made by Jeff Cohn telegraphs excess on several fronts, from its price to its suggestion to decant one to two hours prior to enjoying, to its ripe strawberry jam sensibilities. Voluptuously big-boned and spicy, given 100% new French oak and a fair amount of whole cluster fermentation, it'll appeal to fans of frothy exuberance and may well be best after time in cellar, through 2018.
This wine does a good job of delivering ripe cherry and plum flavors, and has a smooth, inviting texture in spite of a firm level of tannin. The flavors are mild enough to please most anyone.
Aggressive in texture, this Syrah-based Rhône-style blend has jagged tannins and a sharp green-peppercorn flavor. With its rough-and-tumble mouthfeel, it calls to be paired with simple fare, like tacos, pizzas or burgers.
Despite the deep crimson color, the nose is surprisingly delicate; showing strawberries and red cherry. Pleasant, easy drinking and well balanced, but not particularly concentrated, this is a wine that will work easily with a wide variety of food without drawing much attention to itself.
Although this is pretty tannic, with a sandpapery grip that finishes with astringency, it's fancy and layered. Waves of blackberries, cassis, coffee, cherries, leather and pepper-cinnamon spices wash over the palate, leaving the impression of importance. Still, it's not an ager. Best now and for a couple of years.
Juicy and peppery this is everything one could want in a Mourvèdre—smooth and delicious with a backbone of earthy leather.
Here is a generous, modern and bold expression of Sangiovese Grosso whose soft layers of chocolate and dark cherry fruit help soften the natural acidity and structure of the 2006 vintage. A polished mineral note adds attractive definition on the finish. Tight and very firm; age this wine 10–20 years.
This wine is light cherry-red in color, showing some bricking. Strawberry, bubble gum and orange-peel aromas are followed by off-dry flavors with a broad feel.
This high-alcohol, full-bodied wine made from a grape variety known for its very dark juice, is definitely deep in color, generous and ripe in flavor, firm and tannic in texture but not at all harsh. It gushes with blackberry, boysenberry and cranberry flavors, coats the mouth with fine tannins and lingers on the finish.
This tastes jammy and very fruity, with tannins that are totally enveloped by the rich texture. Plummy and comfortable, it's all about ripe berries and currants. Smoky flavors come from the wood aging, and contrast with the Port-like lusciousness of the wine.
Hearty in toasty vanilla, this softly textured Primitivo has a wealth of blackberry fruit and weighty texture that veers dangerously close to overpowering before pulling back and finding its balance. The finish keeps you coming back for more.
Here's a stylish, flashy Napa red that's ready to drink now, even without decanting. It's rich and layered with blackberries, cherries and cassis, folded into sweet, soft, complex tannins. It's a Cabernet Sauvignon-based Bordeaux blend with 14% Sangiovese, which seems to add acidity.
Soft and citrusy, with streaks of lime and mineral and a surprisingly long, Burgundian finish. Clean and steely, with no trace of oak. The fine ripe fruit speaks volumes. Best Buy.
The estate vineyard of Bacalhôa has produced this rich, smooth-textured wine. It has been wood aged, giving a balanced feel on the palate. The wine is dense, full of rich fruits as well as spice and a rounded texture. Age for 2–3 years, or drink now.
Blackberry and black cherry sauce aromas are given intrigue with tobacco leaf and sharp clove spice on this wine from a vineyard between the Santa Lucia Highlands and the Carmel Valley. Cinnamon stick and allspice shine on the very spicy palate, which is laid across a boysenberry backbone, with flecks of black pepper throughout.
A cherry-fresh wine that's so full of fruit that its structure becomes secondary. A dry edge of tannin supports the fruit and acidity, making this wine so drinkable now.
This is a very good Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon. It's dry, full-bodied and has an impeccable tannin-acid structure, with complex flavors of blackberries, currants, herbs and sweet oak. Ready to drink now.
This serious red blend puts together a texture firmed up with gripping tannins and acidity, flavors brimming with blackberry and sweet spices and a lingering finish. Too structured to appreciate alone, it will need pairing with roast beef, lasagna, ribs or the like.
Sweet accents of vanilla bean and cedar spice up the red plum and raspberry core of this wine. Creamy and round in the mouth with soft tannins and a medium-length finish, this is a wine that's easy to enjoy now.
Shows varietally correct grassiness and herbal notes on the nose, followed by round, honeyed fruit flavors that turn racy and grapefruity on the finish. Suitable as an apéritif or paired with slightly weighty fish dishes.
The wine continues the rise in quality of whites from this producer. It is refined, elegant, not powerful, but with a great balance between wood and fruit, and a long, lingering green fruit aftertaste.
Lush, ripe and a touch heady, this is a rich selection that's brimming with notes of white peach, quince, melon and red apple. Thankfully, hints of ginger, nectarine pit and citrus rind add lift to the palate and remain through the medium-length finish.
Dusty berry fruit aromas blend with milk chocolate and lactic notes on what amounts to a mildly oaky nose. The mouthfeel, meanwhile, is juicy and just right. Flavors of berry fruits, licorice and raisin finish full, minty and ripe, with lasting freshness.
Sweet and syrupy, with molasses on the nose. On one hand it's rich, ripe and flavorful, but also cooked, lumpy and heavy. It's almost like a sweet red; sappy and made to be drunk soon.
Muscular and power-packed, with a deep-purple tint, saturated berry aromas and a strong whack of oak. The mouth is deep, dense and chock full of blackberry, chocolate, coffee and cinnamon. No complaints about the richness and fruit quotient, but it's arguably too oaky. Should improve with time.
Tastes just a little sweet in citrus and tropical fruit flavors, but the acidity is nice, almost tingly, and the finish is clean. Fine as a cocktail sipper and with spicy Asian noodles with chicken or prawns.
Nicely balanced and firmly structured, this earthy red opens with classic Sangiovese aromas of tilled soil, pressed blue flower, red berry, herb and a whiff of game. The savory palate delivers juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry, clove, tobacco and licorice accompanied by chewy tannins.
Sourced from select barrels drawn from five estate vineyards, the reserve spent 10 months in oak. It is only made in exceptional years, and 2012 was certainly among the best in memory. Berry, cherry and toast components are here in full measure, with a sumptuous mocha-infused finish. Still young, this wine will show best with aeration, or tuck it away for some extra bottle age.
This light, fresh-tasting sparkler tastes something like a still Riesling from the Mosel, with zesty lime and lemon zest flavors enlivened by bubbles and a bit of underlying minerality. Imported by Chapin Cellars, LLC.
The very ripe flavors of pears and peaches are a little sweet, but nicely balanced by a cool edge of lime-tinged acids that provide focus to the fruit-bowl flavors. Typical New Zealand style of fairly high alcohol (for Riesling), coupled with slight residual sugar and intense acidity.
Rugged at first, with a strong blast of shoe polish and pickle barrel. Runs toward simple despite having a lot of color. The palate shows oaky notes of vanilla, marshmallow and cherry liqueur, while the finish is a bit medicinal. Not a congruent package.
Fruity extract marks this big flavored, jammy wine, brimming with raspberries and cherries. It shows a modern approach to grapegrowing and winemaking, designed to satisfy palates, but it could use some old-fashioned complexity. Might develop in the bottle over the next 3–5 years.
Sunny yellow peaches, apples and nuts perfume this bright lemon-fresh Weissburgunder, or Pinot Blanc. A whisper of herbs lends savoriness to crisp apple, pear and citrus flavors on the palate. It's a straightforward yet refreshing and elegant wine.

The people at Hidalgo in Sanlúcar have taken dry Manzanilla and have let it age until it has turned golden and mature. The bouquet is full of exotic oils, nuts and some horsehide. In the mouth, it's a touch salty and astringent, but there are buttery, sweet undertones and great focus. And on the back end the pure flavor of mushroom and almonds is uncanny. Sleek, acidic and likely perfect with lobster or shrimp bisque.
With attractive lemon flavors within a smooth and rich wine, this is both bright and ripe. It's aromatic and full in the mouth, showing apple, peach and mineral tones. Drink from 2015.
This young, brash Cabernet is filled with adolescent power and angst. It's all sinew and potency now, in the grip of strong, masculine tannins that overshadow the blackberry fruit. It's clearly a cellar candidate, and should emerge, in eight years or so, with authority.
The wine is rich, ripe with delicious red fruits and a touch of attractive acidity. The aftertaste is soft, full and fruity. The wine comes from the small appellation of Coteaux Varois in the heart of Provence.

Tobacco, rooty spice, black cherry and earthy aromas set up a high-acid palate that's racy and shearing. Flavors of toasty oak, plum, raspberry and carob finish long and wiry, with a note of citric acidity. Drink through 2023.
A rich, ripe and finely balanced wine. Its acidity cuts through the full pear and apricot flavors to give a tight crispness. At this stage, it is all fruit and acidity, but it does have the potential for greatness with a more complex sense coming from the wood aging and the fine, tight texture.
Aromas of menthol, dried flower, ripe berry, leather and savory herb lead the nose. The rich palate delivers crushed wild cherry, stewed plum, cinnamon, anise and a hint of vanilla alongside round tannins. Despite its big, friendly structure, it also boasts finesse. Drink through 2022.
Borra demonstrates its mastery with whites in this interesting, perfect mélange of sweetness and zip. Made in a dry style, the sweetness is mostly in the aromatics, which imply peach-colored roses, and inviting mouthfeel, which imparts subtle grapefruit and stone fruit amidst all the crispness.
This opens with dark, inky concentration and savory aromas of leather, black fruit, tobacco and black cherry. The wine feels smooth and rich on the palate.
Fairly sweet berry and cassis aromas mix with some heat and alcohol, and then things settle down as bright but mildly rubbery cherry, cassis and raspberry fruit takes over. It's a little astringent and stretched out, but it doesn't try to do too much and thus is easy end enjoyable. Imported by Orvino Imports.
This 100% Cabernet is a blend of the winery's S.L.V. and Fay vineyards, and one of the most famous bottlings in Napa Valley. But the 2010 simply is not in the same league of past bottlings. It's pleasant with rich blackberry, cherry, cocoa and new oak flavors, all wrapped up with fine tannins. But it doesn't deliver that "wow!" factor, especially at this price, and it doesn't seem particularly ageworthy. Blame it on the erratic vintage. Drink now–2015.
Modest and generally clean on the nose, this features little more than a touch of berry. It feels tight and juicy, with citrus flavor and not much complexity. A note of pink grapefruit shows up on the finish.
Brooding aromas of spice box, herb, purple fruit and wood spice are followed by medium-bodied cranberry flavors. The tannins bring a sense of astringency, requiring some time in the cellar to (hopefully?) soften.
From Oakville, a wine quite different from Bond's Melbury. Not as immediately lush and flamboyant, it's a trace more reserved. Darker, too, more tannic and closed. Starts with an earthiness. Airing brings out cherries and cassis. There is great balance and integrity here, even though it is in desperate need of cellaring. Drink 2009.
With aromas of cherry cough syrup and expensive oak, this is a big, rich, flashy Shiraz. Fine-grained tannins, balanced acidity and plenty of plush fruit mark the palate, but the oak is a little too much in the fore.
Aromas of plum, chocolate, wood spice and smoke lead to sweet, medium-bodied fruit flavors. The tannins come off as somewhat dry.
Here's a sour and astringent expression of Cabernets Sauvignon and Franc, Merlot and Syrah that opens with sharp black fruit and Indian spice. The fruit flavors are jammy and rich on the close.
The nose is jammy and slightly medicinal at first, but then plum and berry aromas settle. This feels firmly tannic and mouthfilling, with baked berry and roasted plum flavors. The finish is hard and strapping, with excess power.
Let's hope this isn't the future of California Pinotage, because the wine smells and tastes Porty, even though the alcohol isn't that high. There's a raisiny, stewed berry element that ends in a dry, harsh finish.
Big, smoky and concentrated on the nose, this has a ton of black fruit and char notes. This is mouth-filling, deep and powerful stuff, with a potent mash of baked blackberry, molasses and barbecue sauce filling in the flavor profile. It finishes long and roasted, with savory oak and saucy spice flavors. A blend of 85% Garnacha and 15% Monastrell.
A fresh, fruity wine, with only the merest tannins. It is bright, clean, the black currant fruits and clean outlines merging into a sweeter, jelly-like aftertaste.
Brambly, herbaceous notes lend a dark, savory tone to preserved apple and peach flavors in this spätlese. Dusty minerals add some complexity to the mid-palate.
Features complex aromas of wild berries, stewed tomato, spices, herbs, and rich earth. Taut acidity makes it a little less charming than many California Pinots, but should give it decent longevity. Delicious now but will improve with a few years of age.
This sparkling red Lambrusco opens with a touch of pungent apple skin backed by red berry and even a touch of leather or spice at the back. This is indeed an amiable expression, so expect tangy sweetness in the mouth.
89-91. Barrel sample. Full-bodied and warm, this is a smooth wine. It's very accessible with blackberry fruit and delicious acidity. An attractive wine.
It's impossible to imagine this wine could have existed even five years ago, even though it hails from the extraordinary Nielson Vineyard that for many years has yielded Byron's best Pinot Noirs, as well as Chardonnays. The ripeness level is something only modern techniques could achieve, and the 2007 vintage was great. Ultrarich in blackberries, cherries and dark chocolate, the wine retains a silky texture and is imposingly full-bodied. Drink now–2013.
Lots of creamy milk chocolate, raspberry, cherry and cassis flavors in this wine,but with 16.2% alcohol, it's really more like a fortified, sweet wine.
The '03 was more balanced. The '04 has more stewed, raisiny flavors that must have been the result of the heat. Drink now with steaks and grilled chicken. Mourvèdre, Syrah and Grenache.
Similar to previous Ballatore Spumantes, this bubbly is sweet with honey notes and a bit scoury in the mouth. Flavors of orange jam, vanilla and yeast are balanced with fine acidity.
Aromas of nettle, gooseberry, grapefruit and mineral are sharp, distinct and varietally appropriate, while the wet, short palate is hollow but edged by green apple, gooseberry and other green fruit flavors. Zesty on the finish, but a little pithy. Drink right away.
This wine is juicy, fruity, and has an easy fresh style. At the same time, there is good intensity of flavor from the ripe, small berries of 2003. Ready to drink now, it should age well over the next 5 years.
There's nice golden brilliance here and sweet notes of citrus blossom and yellow peach. The wine doesn't have huge dimension but it does have a fine point of acidity on the close that really livens up the finish.
This elegant wine opens with fragrances of white flowers and green apple. The silky palate offers ripe pear, Golden Delicious apple and mineral alongside crisp acidity that leaves a clean, bright finish.
From 100% Pommard clone grapes, this ripe and luscious wine is packed with razor-sharp, brambly-berry fruit. Lively minerality underscores the ample acidity, keeping the wine fresh and focused. The extended finish is pleasantly peppery.
Obviously wood aged, this is still a richly fruity wine. The two elements are still coming together, the spice and toast on the one hand, the ripe blackberry on the other. Give the wine time and it will be a good expression of the structure of the vintage. Drink from 2016.
This opens bearing scents suggesting banana and tropical fruit, with an oily character. On the palate, the flavor veers toward sour apple, with tart acids. The finish brings in a lick of butter, but at the moment it doesn't quite come together. This may benefit from more bottle age.
Peaches and rosewater are the dominant flavors in this tasty, all Grenache rosé. Though it comes across as a bit one dimensional, that dimension has plenty of fruity appeal, supported with lemony acids and a hint of bitter rind.
Light in color and ethereally earthy, this wine opens with delicate notes of rose petal and allspice. It then broadens into a gorgeous, medium-weight and mouthfilling sensation of red fruit and more spice, which lingers long on the finish.
Very dark and grapey, with raisin, licorice and bite to the bouquet. Saturated and heavy in the mouth, with lemony acidity framing loud, generic black fruit flavors. The finish features ample oak in the form of butter and coconut. A little overripe and oaky, but on the right path.
This lovely sparkling wine has aromas of white peach and bread crust. The palate delivers creamy peach and apricot flavors, along with notes of toasted almond. Crisp, quenching acidity makes for a clean finish.
Riesling is the star of an excellent lineup of Best Buys from StoneCap. Estate-grown, fragrant and complex, it sends up aromas of lemon oil, orange peel, fresh-brewed tea, pastry and powdered sugar. Mildly sweet, fruity and delicate, it surprises with exceptional length. A very fine effort from new StoneCap winemaker Kendall Mix.
It’s a significant commitment of time, money and resources to cellar a sparkling wine for this long, and Ferrer is to be commended for going the extra mile. The wine rewards the years of producer patience with a soft richness that is both lush and creamy. The once-fresh bready scents have evolved into a toasty, nutty smoothness, and the flavors coat the palate and mellow through an extended finish.
Nutty and doughy, this amazingly complex offering mixes in plenty of citrus fruits, plums, and mineral and floral notes. The juxtaposition of creamy texture and delicacy of weight leaves you wondering, “How do they do that?” It’s hard to believe such an ephemeral sip can carry so much flavor.
This five-grape blend straddles the gamut of aromas and flavors. It starts with a flat, aged cheese and tobacco nose before opening to show cassis, raspberry and other solid fruit flavors. The finish is sturdy and lengthy, and overall it delivers a round feel and good expression.
Classic late-harvest Zin that packs a real whallop. Wld berries and stone fruits mingle with pruny, raisiny notes in this softly textured, rather alcoholic wine. They couldn't or didn't ferment to dryness, so there's some sugar in the middle palate and finish, where those raisiny flavors reappear.
This ripe wine opens with a fragrance of mature red and black berry, clove and black pepper. These carry over to the warm palate alongside brooding and tightly-knit tannins. It has a forward character and soft acidity so enjoy this now and over the next few years.

This is a full-bodied yet crisp and firmly tannic Cabernet that appears in need of further cellaring. A prominent eucalyptus character accents notes of cassis and espresso, while the finish is a bit tough and gritty at this stage. Try 2018–2025.
Classic Cabernet, from its mint and cassis aromas to its ample weight and long, plush finish. This is full and velvety, with hints of cedar and vanilla blending easily into the whole. Approachable now, it should age well through at least 2025.
Briary red-fruit aromas are earthy and mellow, with notes of red-apple skin and raspberry. This is medium in body, fresh and feels good on the palate. Plum, raspberry and vanilla flavors are lightly herbal, while the finish is largely smooth and mild.
Jean-Pierre Fayard family's main estate wine, from organic vineyards, is ripe with attractive red-berry fruit and light bright acidity. It is a finely balanced crisp and clean wine, ready for any summer's day.

There's a tight, muted quality to this wine. While it floods the mouth with cherry, raspberry, Dr. Pepper and cocoa flavors, the acids and tannins are Burgundian, suggesting ageability. You can drink it now, but decanting is advisable. Otherwise, stick it in the cellar until sometime in 2009 or 2010.
Ripe, round and fleshy, this brings generous tree fruits annotated with bright spices. It's clean, fresh and has a hint of mint in the finish.

This wine is textured, fresh and with beautiful acidity, along with an edge of tannin and a sense of structure. The freshness is palpable, leaving a steely, crisp aftertaste. Drink from 2018.
Light in texture, this wine shows a fair amount of barrel influence aromatically. On the palate, it's similarly challenging to disregard the oak, which frames a mid-weight body marked by sour cherry.
Whiffs of smoke and struck flint persist from nose to finish, lending dramatic minerality to this otherwise juicy, fruity Riesling. Sunny peach and tangerine flavors are semi-sweet on the palate, but it's a refreshing wine with a honed elegance throughout.
With racy acidity, this palate-cleansing Chard shows a firm minerality undergirding Key lime pie filling and oaky, vanilla flavors. Fully dry, it's a good food Chard. Try with a creamy mushroom risotto.
Rich and round but not overdone, with a nice brightness to the apple, clementine and white peach aromas and flavors. Balanced and well-integrated, with all of the components working together in harmony. Closes on a brisk citrus-rind finish. Drink now–2014.
This Port is structured, with notes of mint and herb. It has blackberry jam flavor and a firm, solid structure, while it also shows intense youthful fruitiness. It is rich and full, showing some firm tannins. Either drink it right now, or leave it for 10 years.
Plum, berry and a noticeable oaky streak define the bouquet on this well-built Rioja. Flavors of raspberry and plum are creamy and end with thickness and full-bodied grip that's balanced off by good acidity. This is perfectly good, healthy and adequately fruity, yet woody.
This wine has a hardness to it that's only partly offset by a touch of residual sugar. The yellow plum and citrus fruit is tart and ungenerous, marked by a slight prickle on the tongue and a lingering mineral finish.
The name “Ripassa” refers to the unique winemaking technique, ripasso, in which the wine undergoes a double fermentation for increased concentration and density. This is bold, powerful and tightly packed with cherry and exotic spice aromas.
A sexy, lush, flat-out beautiful nose introduces this dusty, decadent wine. The blackberry fruit is ripe and highlighted with pastry spices and crust with hints of light dried herb. It is starting to move into secondary fruit flavors, lush and round and full-bodied, and the finish adds veins of earth and smoke and forest floor. Really a revelation.
Nicely integrated oak saturates the bouquet with suggestions of toast and spice without being overt, alongside custard and melon aromas. Flavors of buttered cashews, melon and citrus are round and soft in the mouth. This is a big, buxom Chardonnay, full-bodied, with a slightly warm, nutty finish. Drink now.
Figari is a simple and tight Valpolicella that opens with bright berry nuances and a touch of bitter almond. There's also an herbal, medicine like note at the back.
Scents of toast, underbrush and black-skinned berry come together on this. The dense palate delivers clove, cedar and tobacco alongside assertive tannins that leave a somewhat raspy finish. Drink through 2020.
This wine's sweet edge will please those who haven't yet grown to appreciate complex Cabs. Aromas of mushrooms and wet soil burn off to reveal a sugary, grapey bouquet. Oak and an herbal, tarragon-like flavor dominate the palate; finishes with smoke and a sweet, Port-flavored candy taste.
Aromas of burnt leaves, grilled meat and rubber/tar are sort of hard and dominant, but the palate is brighter and fruity, with lively raspberry and plum along with carob and olive flavors. Good but seems slightly stalky/herbal on the finish.
Fresh, clean and spicy minerality typifies this Shiraz.  Leather and berry on the nose leads to a well structured combination of flinty and rich flavors on the palate. A good South African Shiraz with its own indigenous character.
Originally intended as a blending grape for the Tempranillo, this is now being separately bottled. The Alder Ridge Grenache is blended with 20% Syrah. It's a ripe, almost liquorous wine, with some alcoholic heat. Nonetheless, the Gramercy style, with an emphasis on acidity and minerality, along with tart red fruit flavors, comes through.
This blend of Sangiovese, Sagrantino, Merlot and Colorino opens with aromas of violet, red and black fruit, and cinnamon-spice. The palate offers ripe but one dimensional blackberry, vanilla and chocolate flavors.

This classic Sancerre is a fresh, crisp, but intensely fruity wine that still tastes of young green fruits and currants. It has a fine depth of flavor, promising good development. Very crisp green apple flavors to finish. Imported by Vineyard Brands.
This is a ripe and dense yet well-balanced wine, offering forward aromas of boysenberry and deep, juicy red plum that are accented by notes of cocoa nib, roasted espresso and char. The palate boasts a plush texture, like crushed velvet, with gripping but not overly firm tannins and concentrated fruit flavors. Notes of licorice and earthy tobacco grace the long finish. Approachable now, but should evolve well through 2021.
This 100% varietal wine was given two-and-a-half years in barrel, the majority of it new American oak. Smoky in character, it has a compressed and extracted feel, built around sizable punches of black plum, cedar, earth and coffee. It's big, but good.
Stalky red-fruit aromas suggest rhubarb and nettles. It feels fresh, lean and dry, with flavors of herbal berry, snappy red cherry and tomato. It turns more stalky and herbal on the finish.
Entirely from Mario's Vineyard grapes, this opens in burly black pepper and cigar box, a powerfully concentrated expression of the variety that's big in persistent tannin and oak, yielding a dry dustiness on the finish.
Bright and sweet, this wine opens with honest aromas of black cherry and mixed fruit jam which harmonize well with the slightly foamy mousse. Raspberry and woodsy notes show through on the medium finish. Try with a Thai steak preparation.
Heavy and slightly vegetal smelling, with a flat feel and flavors of banana, pineapple and vanilla. Chunky, soft and bitter on the finish. Like tropical fruit juice; bears hardly any resemblance to textbook Chardonnay.
A good, rich, dry bubbly, with a creamy, leesy taste and long finish. The flavors of figgy vanilla and praline are unusual for a bubbly, but nonetheless are delicious.
A unique blend of Syrah, Barbera, Malbec, Petit Verdot and Mourvèdre all aged in neutral oak, it's a straightforward, easy drinker with sweet notes of plum, cracked pepper and tire rubber.
100% Cabernet Sauvignon from Wallula Vineyard, this brooding wine screams of the Horse Heaven Hills with notes of dusty earth, black currant, and bittersweet chocolate. It's tightly coiled and largely about structure with its firm tannins supporting concentrated cherry flavors. Needs time to come into its own but has the stuffing to lay down for a decade or more.
Just bottled when tasted, this is a wine that needs a few months to come together. Its ripe pear and apricot fruit and dense flavor will offer a full, rounded wine that goes more for a tropical Sauvignon Blanc character.
Plum and berry aromas are lively and come with a mild scent of animal fur. This blend of four grapes, led by Tempranillo, feels blocky and loosely defined, while flavors of plum, raspberry and a touch of herbal green finish spicy and woody. Will function best as an everyday wine.
Condensed and dark on the bouquet, with initial hard, cheesy aromas giving way to herbal berry scents that suggest thyme and rosemary. The palate is soft and chubby, with just enough structure to make the earthy, ripe berry flavors taste better than simply big and bulky. Finishes with a light espresso bitterness. Drink now through 2012.
The wine shows bitter fruits, a layer of dry tannins as well as attractive acidity. It has a touch of spice over the juicy, fruity aftertaste.
A hot, rather brutal wine. High alcohol combines with high, hard tannins to make for a real textural challenge, despite interesting cherry, licorice and Canadian bacon flavors. Drink now.
This hearty Rosso opens with spicy aromas of candied fruit, clove, dark spice and cured meat. The wine has a warm, earthy note that is characteristic of Tuscany's Sangiovese. The mouthfeel is tart, bright and fresh on the finish.
Here's a delightful Montefalco Rosso that's made in an easy-drinking style. It offers upfront raspberry and cherry flavors, with hints of orange peel and black licorice.
Quite ripe, with a touch of stewiness that settles with time and morphs into a pool of ripe cherries, berries and raisins. More soft than hard, with easygoing tannins and a meaty, chunky finish laced with licorice and cured meat. Dense and chewy. Imported by Five Star Imports.
For a wine with such a large volume (over half a million cases were imported to the U.S.), the quality is admirable. Passion fruit and grapefruit elements dominate, while some grassier notes emerge as the wine sits in the glass, resulting in a pleasant blend of tropical and herbal notes. It's plump on the midpalate, then gains focus on the lengthy, mouthwatering finish.
Compact and full in the nose, with a fine level of berry fruit and some attractive wood spice. The mouth offers sweet berry flavors and some toasty oak, while the finish is round and soft. There's little complexity or style—what you smell and taste at first is what you get.
Seems prematurely aged, with slight bricking already apparent at the rim and leafy, tomatoey aromas and flavors. Not bad, just old before its time.
Good for drinking now, it's bright in acidity, with long-lasting flavors of Meyer lemon, cantaloupe, vanilla bean and honey.
Peach, melon and acacia aromas are friendly but simple. This has shearing acidity and thus it comes across fresh but lemony on the palate. Flavors of nectarine, lemon-lime and pineapple finish snappy and with lasting acidity.
From a very fine vintage, this structured, tight while also fruity Champagne is poised and stylish. A creamy mousse balances the crisp texture and beautiful acidity. Red fruits and blood orange come through well at the end. It is ready to drink.
Dusty white fruit aromas come with a hint of matchstick on the nose. The palate is disjointed, with melon and palaya flavors which turn pulpy and bitter on the finish.
From an extreme coastal vineyard three miles north of Cambria, this bottling kicks off with peppery spice on the nose along with strong black olive, bay leaf, dill and a black-raspberry element on the edges. Lively underripe fruit tones power the palate, as does Kalamata olive, North African spice, coriander and tomato leaf.
Made entirely with Pinot Nero, this opens with aromas of raspberry, Alpine herb and a balsamic note. The juicy palate doles out ripe strawberry, mineral and a hint of baking spice alongside supple tannins. Enjoy soon.
An unusual version of Pearl, this includes 9% Grenache Blanc and 5% Roussanne in the blend. Though it's labeled Sauvignon Blanc, those other grapes seem to command center stage, and the wine might as well be thought of as a creative white blend rather than a single variety. Pungent and herbal, it has well-knit and balanced green and yellow fruit flavors, with notes of caraway seed and grass.
While Savigny is better known for its red wines, its whites have a rich, soft character that makes them accessible when young. This wine, from 40-year-old vines and aged lightly in wood, is structured, mineral and full of crisp green and white fruits. Drink from 2016.
A bit soft and sweet, with a candied taste reminiscent of a pineapple and hazelnut fruit and nougat bar. The '06 Reserve is far better, though at twice the price.
Ripe black-fruit aromas get a boost from dark spice notes. Saturated, heavy and deep in the mouth, this is a meaty wine with blackberry flavors leading herb and leathery notes. On the finish, this remains dark and driven by black fruits and firm tannins. Drink through 2018.
Chamomile blossoms seem to perfume this delicately fruity, floral wine. Medium-sweet in style, it's dainty and spry, showering the palate with sweet Meyer lemon, lime and honey. It's pristine through a long meandering finish.
From a winery started in 1973, this is an excellent Chardonnay. Vibrant almond and macadamia nut mesh with guava, peach and melon notes on the nose. A clean line of citrusy acidity dissects the palate, cutting into ripe stone fruit and touches of smoke and oak to yield a mouthwatering finish.
The Doyenne Métier generally drinks very well right out of the chute, and this 2009 is no exception. Supple and concentrated, this blend of 51% Grenache, 32% Mourvèdre and 17% Syrah is an absolute riot of mixed berry fruit scents and flavors. Full, lush, dense and quite long in the finish, it's a spicy, brilliant bit of winemaking. Can it age? Undoubtedly. But good luck keeping your hands off it!
Made in the California style, with very ripe pineapple and apple fruit, elaborated by French oak barrels, malolactic fermentation and sur lie aging. The result will appeal to many, even if it's a bit obvious and direct.
This easy-going Prosecco opens with a fresh bouquet of white flowers, citrus, peach and talc powder. The mouthfeel is crisp, fresh and very informal.
Ripe and creamy, with tropical fruits that vie with gooseberry flavors, resulting in maximum freshness. There is an intriguing, herbal element, with thyme and basil adding to the delicious mix.
A balanced wine, not powerful although well concentrated with its red berry fruits and dusty tannins. It has beetroot flavor, acidity and a firm, dry finish.
92-94 Barrel sample. A beautiful, aromatic, minty wine that has dusty, warm tannins, still within the Bordeaux structure. It's very dry, but the fruit is already enjoyable. This is going to be a delicious wine.
Petrol and citrus aromas and flavors merge seamlessly in this medium-bodied dry Riesling. It seems atypically round for such a young Eden Valley Riesling, so maybe not a long-term proposition, but it goes down easily now, with a long, slightly oily finish.
Aromas of oak, toast, espresso, exotic spice, spirits, dried black cherry and coconut carry over to the warm palate. Showing the heat of the vintage, the fruit is already drying up while bracing tannins provide the framework.
Packaged in an eye-catching gold bottle, this cheerful Italian sparkling wine opens with floral tones of jasmine and honeysuckle followed by a thin, easygoing mouthfeel. This is a great bubbly to serve at birthday parties or anniversaries.
You can tell this is going to be sweet by its gold color. And there's no deception, except along with that sweetness there is a surprising (and delightful) freshness, which comes from sweet apple juice acidity. The toffee is more obvious than the honey, but this remains a fresh, vivid wine.
This biodynamically farmed wine comes from Steep Creek Ranch next to the winery facility and Nelson Vineyard on the shores of the Columbia River. It shows lots of intrigue, with pure notes of herbs, mulberry and mineral that are enjoyable yet elusive. It's clingy in feel, with elegant yet rich fruit flavors.
Lively and a touch prickly, with strong aromas and flavors that properly reflect its Leyda roots. The nose is oceanic and sharp, while the palate is forward and tastes of lime and grapefruit. On the finish, notes of passionfruit and lychee are introduced. Tropical but true SB to drink as soon as possible.
Jammy and candied to start with. Black cherry, boysenberry and plum flavors are friendly but basic, while the texture and finish are nothing to take issue with. Perfectly fruity and easy, but runs short on complexity.
This beautifully balanced wine has a fine texture of steely acidity and ripe fruit tones. Like many Pouilly-Fumé wines, it needs time to mature further to bring out the great fruit and the fine structure that will make this an impressive wine. Drink from 2018
It's interesting and a little odd that this 100% Sauvignon Blanc, from Mondavi's heralded To Kalon's great I Block, already is showing signs of maturity, although it's only about three years old. The reserve To Kalon, released more than a year ago, was fresh and fruity. This wine by contrast is beginning to show mushroom, herb and mineral complexities alongside the citrus fruits. It's a very fine wine, superior in structural integrity and bone dry, but it will separate wine lovers into opposing camps.
What a delicious, drinkable wine with peach and fresh-fruit flavors, a touch of pineapple and a touch of almonds. Relish the wine now, or enjoy over the next 5 years.
An improvement over the previous vintage, this blend of Malbec, Cabernet and Syrah from Cafayate is earthy and baked, with savory leather and spice aromas laid over dark berry notes. It's a ripe, rich wine with meaty plum, berry and cherry flavors. And the mouthfeel is quite good.
A juicy, tropical Sauvignon Blanc ripe for warm weather sipping, textured in mango, pineapple and a hit of fresh pear. Intense with a savory taste on the finish, this white is perfect on its own or ideal with seafood or crackers smothered in goat cheese.
With the weight expected from a 100% Pinot Noir wine, this is rich while also textured with tight minerality and tense acidity. It is dry, concentrated with the weight of two Grand Cru vineyards behind it. The wine is just ready to drink, although it will show well with a few more months in bottle.
Smoke and crushed granite lend a mineral tone to bright raspberry and cherry notes on this concentrated, juicy Pinot Noir. Sour cherry and red currant penetrate the palate, extending to a slightly astringent finish. Drink now to enjoy its youthful, fruity character.
Fresh and minerally, melon and peach aromas introduce the medium-bodied palate. Flavors of peach, melon and passion fruit finish clean and modest.
Beautifully lifted, almost sublimated apple and citrus fruit combine to make a perfumed, appetizing nose. That pure apple theme continues on the concentrated palate that sings with purity to leave a satisfying and honest impression of completeness. Pure and simply very delicious.
This wine is mostly Pinot Gris and Viognier along with a pinch of Orange Muscat. It's easy drinking, with flavors of peach and the underside of a pineapple plus a touch of sweetness and a crisp finish.
The vineyards of this estate take their name from their hillside (Puy) position. The wine is still very young with its generous black fruits and acidity still bubbling with energy. With tannins in the background, it will be a wine that develops relatively quickly, certainly ready to drink by 2019.
Sharp and sassy for the most part, but with airing things improve a bit and you start to find red fruit and honest spice. The feel is lean and vibrant, with jumpy acids creating a crisp mouthfeel. Will settle somewhat but won't ever deliver much in the way of rich berry fruit or a chewy mouthfeel.
This is a unique, oak-aged Finger Lakes ice wine made by Long Island winemaker, Anthony Nappa. Fermented spontaneously and intentionally oxidized, it juxtaposes silken caramel with sea salt and bitters. It's a fascinatingly funky wine worthy of some contemplative sipping.
Full, rubbery and robust on the nose, with earthy berry aromas. The palate shows cassis, cherry and raspberry along with spiky, zesty acidity. Herbal, savory notes accent the finish, and overall this is a medium bodied Cab with lively fruit and freshness.
Full-bodied and lushly textured, this delicious Gigondas is a blend of 80% Grenache, 15% Syrah and 5% Mourvèdre. It's fragrant with hints of wildflowers and black cherries, but adds enough savory hints of black olive and coffee to avoid being a simple fruit bomb. A bit warm, but impressive; for early drinking.
Made with organically farmed fruit, this hearty Chianti Superiore opens with a muddled bouquet that sees overlapping fruit, almond and earth aromas. The mouthfeel, however, is rich and penetrating.
This blend of Syrah, Tempranillo, Cab Sauvignon and Merlot shows the upside potential of Valencia, one of Spain's low-profile regions. A nice mix of vanilla, root beer, spice, plum and chocolate aromas reflect 18 months in oak. With full stout tannins and deep ripe flavors of plum, cassis, tobacco and chocolate, this barrel-influenced middleweight should age nicely through 2022.
Ripe and full-bodied, this opens with aromas of mature black-skinned fruit, leather toast, licorice and menthol. The round, forward palate doles out juicy black cherry nutmeg, mocha and grilled sage offset by loosely knit tannins. Drink 2017–2022.
Clean, citric and minerally on the nose, this Hungarian sparkler follows with good, medium-bodied flavors of toast and mineral on the palate. It has a restrained style but the fruit still flirts with the tongue and leaves a finish that is both pert and sweet. Imported by MHW Ltd.
Rich, structured and juicy, this wine shows black fruit tones, with its firm tannins and fine acidity. It's developing into a warm, ripe wine. Drink from 2020.
Here's a Pinot Grigio with fruit selected from five different vineyards in Friuli's Gradisca d'Isonzo area. Three of the sites render fruit used as the wine's backbone and the remaining sites render fruit with more delicate aromas of dried hay, vanilla bean and dried lemon rind. Imported by Empson (USA) Ltd.
Notes of olive, herbs, flowers, orange peel, gravel, meat, coffee and light barrel spices leap up on a wine that shows a lot of aromatic complexity. The fruit and savory flavors are plush and full in feel followed by a lingering finish. There's a whole lot of wine delivered for this price.
Cola and earthy berry aromas float over a slightly herbaceous note. This blend is narrow and tannic on the palate, with berry, spice and herbal flavors. The finish shows pleanty of oak in the form of mocha and coffee flavors.
Buttery spice and fresh citrus aromas lead this likeable white. Sea salt, graphite and ripe oranges on the palate offer crisp yet rounded flavors. A spicy finish seals the deal. Pair with fresh fish, fruit.
Made with Vernaccia Nera grapes, this pink rosé sparkling wine is redolent of sweet fruit, raspberry, dried sage, honey and lemon soda. Tight, tonic effervescence and fresh acidity keep the palate clean.
Ripe, yellow peach and apricot flavors are dusted by layers of smoke and mineral in this fruity yet deeply earthen spätlese. Brisk lemon-lime acidity keeps the mouthfeel fresh and breezy.
Mocha and chocolate welcome you in, but once you get in there isn't much to taste. There's generic red fruit, spice and leather, but the wine seems acidified and on the razor's edge. Not overly generous and the mouthfeel is sheering.
Lightly spritzy, grassy and crisp, with melon, pineapple and grapefruit. Is there just a hint of sweetness to cut the grassiness?
Saffron and spice entice from nose to finish in this richly honeyed, yet dry Riesling. The palate is a delightful kaleidescope of fruit and mineral nuances anchored firmly by a stream of grapefruit and lime acidity. It's a complex, penetrating wine sure to improve through at least 2025.
Produced from organically grown grapes, this razor-sharp wine is fresh with caramel and red berry flavors. It's a lively wine enhanced by a zingy orange zest character. Drink now, although the wine will be better at the end of 2015.
This has aromas of stalky underbrush, porcini mushroom, game and berry. The wine's uber-simple palate shows suggestions of wild cherry and a hint of clove alongside drying, fleeting tannins and brisk acidity.
This is a dry, acidic, tannic and earthy Syrah. It has impressively deep flavors of black and red cherries, bacon and sandalwood, and gets better as it breathes in the glass. Not an ager, but give it a few hours in a nice decanter.
Here's a fresh, delicious Nero d'Avola, loaded with juicy blackberry and black cherry sensations that are accented by hints of black pepper and nutmeg. It's a delightfully easy-drinking, fruit-forward style meant to be enjoyed young.
You'll appreciate the easygoing and straight-shooting nature of this fresh and informal Barbera d'Alba from the Bussia cru. The nose includes bright aromas of spice and raw, somewhat sharp tones of forest berry and raspberry. Pair this wine with meat involtini (meat rolled with breadcrumbs and pignoli nuts).
This Chelan winery improves from vintage to vintage. This new Syrah is satiny and rich, with pliant flavors of mixed berry, cherry and stone fruit. The new oak adds smoke and toast, but the gamy, meaty and pungently herbal notes come from the grapes. Winemaker Larry Lehmbecker has crafted a seamless and complete wine that delivers a lot of pleasure for the price.
Beautifully concentrated and rich, this wine is so dense with black fruit and dark-chocolate flavors that it's almost chewy. Blended from nine grape varieties, it has a wealth of fine-grained tannins and feels velvety in texture, while the powerful, layered flavors linger on the finish.
There's a shrillness to this wine, rich in overripe, preserved lemon and a daunting taste and aroma of oak. The body and weight of the wine don't overpower, but the fruit and oak don't seem in balance.
Tannic to the point of stemmy, this hard and compact blend includes 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 24% Merlot, 23% Cabernet Franc and 3% Malbec. Chewy red fruits run into a tight, tough finish.
Be grateful that Stéphane Aviron is an old-vine hunter. Serious tannins and concentration from 100-year-old vines give this wine its depth and richness. It has a great potential to age with black fruits, a mineral texture and acidity. This is an impressive cru wine, full of both fruit and density. Drink from 2019.
The trick with sparkling wine is to achieve finesse. This Pinot Noir-Chardonnay blend is too scoury in bubbles, giving it a rough feel. Nonetheless it's delicious and easy to like for its yeasty flavors of limes, oranges and vanilla honey.
Instantly recognizable for the eye-catching purple dot on its label, this offers a slightly austere expression of Aglianico that would pair with almost any grilled meat dish. The soft mouthfeel is characterized by notes of cherry, tobacco and spice.
This is a light- to medium-bodied rosé made exclusively from Syrah grown in the northern reaches of the Rhône Valley. The cooler climate gives it a lighter bearing and redder fruit flavors than many other Rhône rosés: this one resembles red plum and pineapple. Drink now.
Dry and snappy but also with a little depth, this nicely balanced wine made from Pinot Noir shows light flavors like watermelon and canteloupe. The texture is appetizingly crisp and the body rather light.
There's a lot of complex, youthful charm in this Cabernet-based wine, which was grown in both of St. Supery's estate vineyards, Rutherford and Dollarhide. It's very rich and ripe in blackberries, cassis, blueberries and dark chocolate, with a savory spiciness. This really defines the Napa style, and demonstrates the great success of the 2007 vintage.
Although red cherry and raspberry make an appearance, this vineyard-designate is otherwise all about forested pine and earthy pungency, accented by a pretty floral tease of rose petal. High in acidity and tannin, it takes time in the glass to settle down and find its balance, with a lengthy finish of black licorice and clove.
Blended from Mendocino, Clarksburg (Delta) and Pope Valley fruit, this easy-drinking Cab is very ripe in blackberries and cherries, but also shows a good structure of tannins and acids. The alcohol is refreshingly low. A good price for a wine so satisfying.
A massive wine for Margaux, packed with tannins and ripe fruit. It has more Cabernet Sauvignon than usual, giving intense black currant flavors with enticing acidity balanced by the sweetness of the fruit. Ripe swathes of this opulent fruit are also elegant and structured.
This vintage shows the heat, with big, ripe cherry intensity, power and beefy aromas of barbecue, red beets, resin, tar and toasted chestnut. The wine boasts deep concentration, almost viscous consistency and a sweet finish.
This wine is a blend of Sauvignon Blanc (73%) and Sémillon. Aromas of tropical fruit (that include kiwi and pineapple, along with toast and herb) lead to sleek spicy fruit flavors, with generous tropical flavors on the finish. It needs some time to settle in but shows a lovely sense of balance.
This is an inviting and easy-drinking selection, with friendly aromas and flavors of green gooseberry, orange peel and grass. There's a hint of pineapple-like acidity, though a bit more cut would help to better balance the palate and freshen up the finish.
This wine is a blend of Grenache (33%), Counoise (24%), Syrah (20%), Cinsault (17%) and Mourvèdre. Expressive fruit-laden aromas of red plum, raspberry, blue fruit and herb are followed by plump, pure fruit flavors, with the mouthfeel only adding the appeal. It's a gorgeous interpretation of these varieties.
This tight wine has acidity with a crisp texture and hints of the fruit to come. A potential for richness comes from the ripe yellow fruits that are developing. Drink from 2017.
With its well-integrated scents of cedar, plum and tobacco, this is a medium-weight wine whose hallmark is its balance. Vanilla and dried spices meld nicely with cherry and plum fruit, finishing smooth, with modest tannins. Drink now-2008.
With new-wood flavors as well as ripe berry fruits, this will be an attractive wine. Warm, ripe and fruity, it has concentration and potential. Drink this wine from 2020.
Fermentation in wood has given this wine a rich spicy character that contrasts with the honey and lemon fruitiness and the mineral texture. Aromatic and perfumed with summer blossoms, it is ready to drink.
Tough, rubbery aromas include notes of carob and leather. The palate has a decent, regular feel to it along with hot flavors of baked fruits and chocolate. Finishes mildly sweet, as if it was dosed with a teaspoon of brown sugar.
If Syrah can be elegant, this is the poster child. Dark and saturated, this wine is nonetheless light and almost airy, in a good way. The fruit flavors (berries and plums) seem to float above a bed of acid and ripe tannins. There are light streaks of iron and coffee and nuances and suggestions of rock and earth. The grapes are from Fielding Hills' Riverbend Vineyard—if you like those wines, you will surely like this as well.
Shows a different face of Viognier, emphasizing a drier, crisper and more minerally profile than most other bottlings. With its acidic stony quality, it hints at citrus, tropical fruits and peaches, and will be versatile at the table.
This is a smoky, obviously wood-aged wine. The burnt toast character is still dominant, waiting for the attractive black currant fruits to catch up. It will develop into a bright, fruity wine, so wait until 2017.
Produced from 25-year-old vines in a six-acre parcel, this is a soft, ripe, red-fruit-flavored wine. Wood aging is noticeable in the smoky character of the wine and the ripe tannins. Otherwise, the juicy, fresh fruit dominates. Drink from 2017.
This smooth and detailed wine mixes tart red fruits with earthy, lightly charred flavors. The robust tannins carry notes of espresso beans and dark chocolate. It will need decanting and/or aeration to bring it all into proper balance.
A soft, fruity wine lacking great depth, but with attractive red berry fruits and light tannins. It is bright, juicy and ready to drink.
Corbaia is Sangiovese and Cab Sauvignon from the southern part of Chianti Classico where temperatures are a bit warmer and the soils a bit thicker. As a result, the wine has added structure and power but it also has pretty buoyancy, elegance and lingering aromas of balsam notes, herbs, black pepper and almond.
This dense and solid wine comes from the eastern ends of the Entre-deux-Mers. It is full of black fruits that balance the firm, dry tannins. Juicy acidity bursts in at the end for a wine that's already delicious and will age well. Best to drink from 2017.
This is crisply defined, dotted with cinnamon, and features tart pomegranate,  cranberry and strawberry fruit. The sleek tannins frame a long, sturdy finish.
An aromatic nose of ripe red and yellow apple promises fruit-forward fizz. On the palate, these notes are intensified by the very vivid frothy bubbles as they burst. There is apple crispness and lots of fruit on the light dry palate. It's an ideal and invigorating apéritif.
Made entirely with Sangiovese, this brisk wine has subtle aromas of violet and clove. The vigorous palate doles out strawberry, cinnamon and a hint of orange peel alongside raspy, rather fleeting tannins. Drink soon.
Delicate toasted hazelnut, honey and pressed yellow flower aromas fill the glass. On the linear palate, a light nutty note accents lemon zest and stony mineral flavors.
A bit more concentrated than the '06, but similar in lush, appealing flavors of cherries, raspberries, cedar, cola, vanilla and spices. With a silky texture, it should develop through 2013.
This has aromas of mature dark-skinned berry, cake spice and toast while the astringent palate displays dried black cherry, coffee and tobacco. It's a bit shy on freshness, so drink soon.
The 76% Cabernet Sauvignon is melded with 17% Merlot, 4% Carmenère, and 3% Malbec, creating a stunningly dense, polished, tight wine. It's light years away from the Leonetti's of the 1980s—compact and loaded with black fruits, pepper, fresh herbs, rock, earth, toast and smoke. It's so tight that it's almost impossible to dissect. It needs time—a lot of time.
Martinborough's trademark savoriness comes through in this wine as hints of soy and mushroom, layered over cherry fruit and chocolaty oak. This medium-bodied Pinot Noir is a bit tight and crisp right now, but it should be fully open and ready for business by mid-2011 and drink well for another 5–6 years after that.
Forward and lush, with a beautiful structure, this dry, balanced wine has cherry, cassis, wintergreen and oak flavors that finish in a swirl of complexity. This fine wine defines the elegance and femininity of a great Rutherford Cab, and should age well through 2012.
The aromas are still locked up, with notes of dark fruit and barrel spices. The palate shows restraint, considering the warm vintage and region, with refined tannins showing a deft touch.
Mild scents of cassis, coffee grounds and worn saddle leather mark the nose of this Petit Verdot. The palate is medium bodied and pliant, and though the alcohol only clocks in at12.5%, it feels warm. Faint tannins add a dust-like traction to the flavors of dried strawberry and spiced mocha.
Small amounts of Malbec and Merlot bring some additional complexity to this Cabernet, but it's still a pretty straightforward wine. Soft and dry, it has generous flavors of blackberry and new oak. Drink now.
Molasses, spice, chocolate and pure raisins define this as classic P.X. It's syrupy but not too much so, with maple, cinnamon and brown sugar flavors. For a sweet and candied dessert wine, it has excellent balance and persistence. A star among many in this category; these wines are hard not to like.
This big, bold blend of 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Petit Verdot and smaller amounts of Malbec and Merlot is powerfully built, with firm, integrated tannins that feel chalky and dusty. Black currant and cherry flavors dominate, with waves of tobacco and dark chocolate leading to a soft, lingering finish. This will cellar well, to be enjoyed 2023–2028.
Barrel-forward aromas of vanilla and toast are in front of herb and cherry. The palate brings a sense of polish and appeal, with the tannins bringing some squeeze on the finish.
The wine has evolved quickly, and the color is showing some browning on the edge. Almost fully mature now, it shows aromas of marzipan, strawberries and roses. Complex and pretty, the wine has a solid midpalate, and the finish is shorter than I would have expected. Still a nice, well-made wine for lovers of older Nebbiolos.
This opens with aromas of toast, coffee, chopped herb and a whiff of cellar floor. The straightforward palate offers dried cherry, licorice and a hint of orange zest alongside firm tannins.
With vineyards in the southern vineyards of the Aube, Vincent Couche makes a rich style of Champagne. This 2002 vintage, now maturing well, is ripe—almost opulent—in character. Its peach and apricot flavors shine at the fore, extended on the palate with a brisk, nervy texture.
Light and fruity, with young vine flavors of strawberries and cherries.
Despite its high alcohol, this high-toned Zin does not have the crushing weight and overall power you'd anticipate. Cranberry and raspberry juice fruit flavors carry balancing acidity, and there's a suggestion of refreshing minerality. Although at first the wine seems disjointed, it smoothes out nicely with aeration.
Australian winemaker John Duval is the winemaker for Long Shadows' signature Syrah. His experience shows in the Oz-like color (almost black), the spicy berry, plum, cherry and currant fruit, and the silky, polished tannins. Interestingly, Duval uses a splash of Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend, rather than going with Viognier. The wine seems to be holding something back; it's definitely got some years ahead.
Ripe black-plum and spice aromas are dense and blocky. This is 85% Syrah and 15% Monastrell, with a jammy palate and a touch of heat and flab. Flavors of raisin, blackberry and prune finish earthy, with an echo of prune and moderately scratchy tannins.
This wine is fresh and full of attractive apple and spice flavors. It is crisp, refreshing and tangy, with a great texture of lemon zest over spicy vanilla and fragrant acidity. It should be drunk now.
Maybe a tad off the pace from the excellent 2008, but still a wonderfully rich, complex wine. Pale in color, it tastes fresh and lively, with raspberry and cherry sour candy flavors accompanied by a burst of zesty acidity. Enjoyable now, and should gain bottle complexities over the next six years.
This smells good and right, with aromas of tropical fruits, spice and mild oak. Fresh and integrated, with good body weight and balance, this Chardonnay tastes of spiced apple, melon and vanilla. On the finish, wood spice and peppery dryness take over.
This Pinot bears only the simple regional Carneros appellation, but it has the rich texture and complex flavors of a vineyard-designated wine. Absolutely delicious, with raspberry, red cherry, mocha and red-licorice flavors that go on and on into a long, spicy finish. Drink this lovely wine over the next few years.
A subdued nose offers whiffs of leather, tobacco, black plum and an earthy note of game. The palate delivers blackberry, prune, white pepper and savory herb. It's already accessible with smooth, almost slippery tannins. Drink through 2019.
Some funk on the nose soon blows off to reveal generously ripe fruit of yellow pear. The palate benefits from a touch of flavor-boosting residual sweetness but the finish is dry. This is full fruited and balanced. Drink while flavors are at their peak.
Crisp and clear, this reserve-level white is sweet and salty in equal measure, offering a smooth taste of melon and peach. With a bite of oaky vanilla and a build-up of body, it finishes with a richness of more fruit.
This is a masculine blend of Montepulciano and Cabernet Sauvignon, for structure, color and tannins, and Sangiovese, for delicate aromas. Coffee, leather, tobacco and sweet cherry are woven within the wine's succulent, meaty consistency.
Lively aromatics and fresh fruit are coupled with a bright, mouthwatering texture and a refreshing finish. White peach, strawberry hull and melon rind form the fruity core of this wine, with assertive lemon-lime citrus flavors infusing the zippy finish.
This is rich with flavors of yellow fruit and ripe pear. It has a good texture, with crisp, citrusy acidity that adds a lively edge to this ripe wine. While it's already drinkable, give this another six months of aging.
Earthy aromas of brandied cherry, spiced berry and coconut require lengthy airing to shed murky, damp notes. This feels tight, with rubbery tannins. Spiced plum, raspberry and foresty flavors finish grabby and lightly herbal.
This fresh Bardolino Chiaretto offers light bubbling and frothy foam with aromas of raspberry, white cherry and pomegranate juice. The wine is informal and light with bitter berry fruit on the close and refreshing acidity. It makes a perfect appetizer wine.
Definitely on the light side, this snappy young wine has a lot of appeal. It's racy and bright, mixing raspberry and cranberry fruit with an earthy base of clay and sod. Additional, unusual flavors of spiced meat come in towards the finish, which shows good persistence.
Pretty standard stuff here, with thin, watery aromas that carry only faint traces of wood and apples, and watery flavors. It's clean, but hot from alcohol, with high acidity. —S.H.
This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot is soft, with berry, cocoa and spice flavors. Drink it with summer barbecue and enjoy.
Springhill Cellars has been around for two decades, but this new release of the estate Pinot Noir is a bit of a disappointment. Light, sweet and simple, it turns a bit medicinal on the finish.
Lifted notes of ripe, juicy apple are foremost on the nose. They also shine on the palate, where they are countered by a fine, gentle and creamy mousse and lovely freshness. This is beautifully composed, understated, fresh and elegant. The dry finish shines with lemon and echoes long.
Made in the traditional Hugel style, this is a dry, high-acid Riesling. Scents of lime and chalk dust combine with green apple and petrol aromas to make for a classic bouquet. Modernists may find the palate a bit lean, but others will find it sharply focused, with a racy, zesty finish.
Here's a somewhat big and full-bodied Merlot with aromas of black cherry and violet florals leading into flavors of black plum and raspberry preserves. There's a good tannic grip on the mouth that lingers through the strong mocha-flavored finish.
Santa Cecilia is a Sicilian icon wine and a quality benchmark for the newly inaugurated Noto subzone. The 2009 vintage takes time to open and build momentum. It feels sharper and edgier than past years and is focused, linear and crisp. Give it 3–5 more years of cellaring.
A streak of waxy honeycomb seems to glaze flavors of pressed apple and pear on the palate of this savory, but honey-kissed wine. Light in body, it's zesty and spry with a clean, cutting finish.
Another superb Cinq Cépages. A blend of all five classic Bordeaux grape varieties-, but based on Cabernet Sauvignon, it is both immediately pleasurable and intensely complex. Waves of black currants, dark chocolate, green olives, licorice and toasty oak roll across the palate, wrapped into firm, dusty tannins. Very good now but should develop further over the next 8–10 years. Easy to find, with 5,500 cases produced.
Here's a very successful expression of Barbera from the Alba zone of Piedmont with bright fruit tones followed by smooth spice, chocolate and tobacco. The wine is rich, supple and powerful on the close with a blast of crisp acidity at the end.
Very soft and buttery, made in a style sure to reach out to a broad base of consumers looking for accessible flavors with lots of oak and tropical fruit. The style feels more Australian than Washington, but it fits in nicely with the winery's expanding lineup of single-vineyard and reserve Chardonnays.
This suffers from major problems. It has all the faults of a hot Zinfandel: semisweet baked-fruit flavors, a lack of acidity, and a resulting medicinal quality.
With a nose of citrus and mineral and a fresh palate, this is nothing but pleasing. Flavors of grapefruit, tangerine, lime and green apple are direct and lively, while the finish is long and fruity. This is how Verdejo should be.
Made entirely from Sangiovese, this wine features aromas of violet, ripe red berries and coffee. The juicy, straightforward palate offers mature black cherry and blackberry layered with espresso notes. The wine has firm tannins, but since it reflects the warm vintage, it isn't an ager. Enjoy soon.
A bit too soft and sweet for Zinfandel, but it sure is delicious in berry fruit, chocolate, pepper and herb flavors. Drink now with barbecue.
A wild animal character and soft gaminess infuses the nose of this classic South African Pinot, but the red cherry and plum flavors still take center stage on this delicate wine. Hints of forest bark and soft menthol grace the finish, while the soft tannins and balanced acidity carry long into the close.
A young, chunky heavyweight is the only way to describe this black wine, which smells of fruitcake and herbs, and tastes of baked plums and chocolate. Rich and overflowing, and building to a tannic crescendo. One can see the mass appeal here.
Complex from the start, marrying floral aromas with hints of stemminess, herbs and spice, all supported by lush black-cherry fruit. Picks up notes of black tea on the finish, so while this tastes good now, it may even improve in another year or two.
The excellence of the 2010 vintage is draped all over this studly Rioja. Earthy aromas of mixed berry fruits and forest floor feed into a saturated but well-balanced palate with firm tannins. Baked black cherry and cassis flavors meander towards a lightly toasted finish with mocha, chocolate and cassis notes. This is outright delicious more than stately or complex. Drink through 2024.

Natural and oak-based spice aromas accent tarry black cherry, blackberry and gritty, toasty scents. Full and chewy on the palate, this tastes oaky, with fully toasted blackberry flavors. A spicy, resiny, oak-heavy finish is right for this wine. Drink through 2019.
An oak-aged blend of Trebbiano and Sémillon, Nemorino shows the sun-kissed touches of ripe fruit and apricot that link this Italian white to its native territory, Tuscany. Natural thickness and density give the wine a pleasantly creamy feel in the mouth.
This is a rough and ready Zinfandel. With its briary, brambly flavors of wild berries and pepper, and the strong, edgy tannins, it needs rich meats and cheeses to play against.
This is a more rustic, woody Cabernet than many from Mendoza. The nose suggests asphalt, herbs and spice more than bright fruit. A tannic yet solid body and flavors of coffee, herbs lead to a finish that tastes dry and a bit hollow, with coffee and cocoa notes.
Young and herbaceous, it has lemon, peach and tight acidity that give a fresh, fruity feel. It's lively, ready to drink now.
A leathery wine, linear and lean in the mouth with dry tannin and acid that lends a mineral feel. Mint and modest red fruit aromas are secondary to leather, which also frames tangy dark berry in the mouth, then grabs hold on the spicy finish.
Solid and firm, this is a wine with a considerable future. The plum and ripe berries are changing into a more mature, smoky, undergrowth character. The structure and the texture remain, with elegant perfumed fruits alongside the ripe tannins. Age for 3–4 years.
Ultra floral, with fresh, clean honeysuckle aromas. In the mouth, apple and peach flavors are fresh and fun, while the finish is smooth and nutty. Soft and meant to drink now; good in its class.
A 900-foot vineyard offers just the right cool conditions for great Pinot Noir. This is impressive, toast and raspberry fruit flavors vying with spice and acidity. It needs 3–4 years for the wood to integrate completely.

Fresh, crisp and more neutral and competent than exciting is how to best describe this racy but lightweight Viura. A citric palate issues short, tangy lime flavors, while the finish is juicy, lean and tight.
Luscious raspberry and red-cherry flavors are concentrated in this bright, fruity rosé. Made predominantly from Cabernet Sauvignon, it's marked by bristles of bramble and herb that lend complexity to the palate. The finish is brisk and refreshingly saline.
On the lean side, with more pineapple and citrus than apple or pear and a tart, crisp character. There's a touch of sweetness, but the emphasis is on brisk lemon and lime flavors. It would make a nice summer refresher.
Big and chewy, this starts with aromas of grilled porcini, underbrush, ripe dark fruit, dried herb and clove. Tightly packed tannins frame dried black cherry, prune steeped in spirits, ground pepper and licorice. You'll also feel the heat of evident alcohol on the midpalate that throws it somewhat off-balance.
A nose of sour cherry and cranberry meshes with sandalwood and savory herbs on this single-site study by the longtime Paso producer. The palate is overflowing with oregano and other dried garden herbs, laid against a juicy red and purple-fruit frame.

The oak—all French—is out front with notes of toast, crème brûlée and spice along with peach and lemon. It's light in style with a warm finish.
Like all ripassos, this expression undergoes a double fermentation, combining elements of both superconcentrated Amarone and lighter, fruitier Valpolicella. It's aged for 12 months in French oak to produce a smooth, sophisticated red, with background tones of ripe fruit, spice and dark chocolate.
Not a winner by any stretch. This Cabernet has thick prune and asphalt aromas, and in the mouth it's heavy and sticky. In terms of flavors, the wine seems overly mushy, herbal and dull. Seems like the grapes were too ripe.
This off-dry Riesling brings in its residual sugar at 23 g/L, offset with juicy acidity. Peach and papaya fruit rule the day in this forward, fruit-driven, enjoyable quaffer.
Earthy, savory notes of yeast and miso swing alongside the green pear flavors. There is spice and concentration on the midpalate and some tingling pepper spice.
A superior Chenin that doesn't denigrate the floral elegance of the grape. Juicy with melons, tangerines and sweet pear. A lovely wine with a hint (1.4%) of residual sugar.
88-90 Barrel sample. Perfumed, light, hinting at minerality, the wine has a smooth veneer over the dusty tannins. The final effect is rich and polished.
Prickly plum aromas are dark, bulky and frankly strange and alarming. The palate is super pointed and fierce, with sweet, funky red fruit and candied red licorice flavors. Hard, aggressive and high in acidity.
Not too refined, but still pretty tasty. The palate offers chewy cherry and raspberry fruit, while the finish is spicy and zesty to the point that it creates a tingle. Somewhat sugary, but definitely an easy one to drink.
This is a lush, heady wine that's full bodied and dry, with massive black cherry, red currant, bacon and cedar flavors. The tannins are thick but smooth, making the wine drinkable now, although it will certainly develop through 2020. There's a pleasant tartness throughout that makes it especially friendly with well-marbled beef.

A distinct aromatic notion of rose petals perfumes the nose. The palate is more in keeping with Pinot Blanc's more restrained nature but is light, fresh and appetizing.

If you enjoy your Syrah on the wild side, you will want a bottle of this.
This shows beautiful touches of cured meat, dried berry, ginger, rosemary oil and cigar box. It is soft and succulent on the finish, but the solid tannins hold it together very nicely.
This is tight, with acidity that cuts through the red fruits and perfumed raspberry flavors. It is light and bright, with minimal tannin and just a hint of structure.
With a wine from every cru in Chablis, La Chablisienne is able to bring out the character of each. This cool Côte de Léchet is typical in its tight, mineral character, revealing its edgy nature. It's a wine with some aging potential, so give it 2–3 years and more.

Despite the size, the texture is gentle and velvety, but it's an ager if you want. Now through 2015.
A nice, easy Zin with some special features. It's dry and balanced in alcohol, acids and tannins, with ripe flavors and a smooth mouth feel. The touch of rusticity should play well against ribs and barbecued chicken.
From a parcel on this 12-acre estate, the wine is structured and rich. It has layers of firm tannins under the black fruits. Acidity and a crisp mineral texture mix with the solid structure and concentration. The aftertaste shows the generous future of this fine cru wine. Drink from 2018.
It's quite a flourish of a name that refers to the vineyard from which this wine comes. This 2004 is now mature, a combination of honey, nuts and a hint of green asparagus and aromas of undergrowth. Go for this wine for its secondary flavors, not the fruit, and then it becomes delicious.
Podere Paganico offers an impressive level of aromatic complexity thanks to layers of forest floor, dried apricot, underbrush, wet earth, cured meats and dried apple skins. It's a chewy, big wine with solid texture and firm tannins.

A touch of the veggies, particularly asparagus and bell pepper, mix with citrus in this fuller-bodied white.

Baked apple aromas lead to a palate that has ripe fruit, and caramel over acidity. The wine is perfumed, full, with suggestions of some oxidation.

Soft and rounded, this has apple and peach fruits, with a lemon zest texture. The acidity is a refreshing counterweight to the smooth character.
Drawn from the cool Awatere Valley, this just off-dry wine features exceptional smoothness on the palate. Pear, guava, citrus and cinnamon aromas and flavors finish creamy and harmonious.
You'll have to go far and wide to find a bigger, richer California Chardonnay. It's enormous, offering an explosion of tropical fruit, citrus and apricot, brightened by crisp acidity. Despite the power, the wine maintains elegance and balance. This is one of the few Chards that will take bottle age, gradually losing fruit. Drink now–2018.
The flagship wine from dynamic organic producer Arianna Occhipinti, a sassy, 20-something winemaker who has taken Sicilian wine by storm since her first vintages. It is a must-try for those looking for new tastes in the emerging school of natural wines. It won't appeal to those with mainstream tastes, but is irresistible to those with an eclectic wine streak.
This year Byington blended in some Syrah with the Cabernet Sauvignon, to good effect. I wish the wine were crisper and better structured, but there's no denying the deliciousness factor. The black currant pudding, cherry pie and vanilla-sprinkled mocha flavors are irresistible.
A powerhouse, but one that shows a certain degree of lushness to its robust blackberry and mint flavors. Finishes long and minerally, bolstered by slightly drying tannins. Should be more approachable by 2015 and last for three decades beyond that.
So delicate that it, at times, seems fleeting. There are pineapple and spice aromas, and white peach joins in on the palate. What's most remarkable is the feel—one minute it feels full, and the next, like dust blowing in the wind. Changing in the glass, and by the sip. Good for the soul. Imported by Old Bridge Cellars.
A bouquet of black cherry, toffee and violet sets the stage for flavors of black cherry, coffee, caramel and soft notes of mint. Acidity and tannins are well balanced, and the appealing finish features bright notes of lightly caramelized fruit and soft touches of mint.
Plenty of blackberry, cherry and mocha fruit flavors in this sugary sweet Cabernet. It's a sound, full-bodied everyday sipper.
Everything about this Zin, from the voluptous texture to the ripe fruit, is perfect, but the wine is overtly sweet in sugar and technically not at all dry, so be forewarned before you buy.
Here's an austere and sophisticated Brunello Riserva with beautifully integrated notes of spice, toast and cola that give backbone to brighter aromas of blackberry, cherry and plum. There's a very attractive intensity and smoothness to this wine that suggest a natural pairing with meat on the grill.
The initial impression of this wine is almost dry. That comes from the dense structure as well as the complex interplay between botrytis and acidity. Yellow fruits and bitter oranges show well, giving both acidity and final sweetness. Drink from 2018
A first-class full-bodied Syrah. It shows true complexity in the spectrum of black currant, teriyaki beef, sandalwood and black pepper flavors. Give it a good decanting and drink now with upscale roasts, game birds and beef stews.
This is seaside Provence rosé right down to the traditional shape of the bottle. It is fresh and bright, with berry fruits and lively acidity. Drink as an apéritif.
The aromas start out quite locked up, with notes of purple fruit and flowers. The palate reveals fresh, quite pure aromas, with well-balanced acid and tannins and a finish that lingers.
An intensely fresh wine, touched lightly by spritz that brings out the lemon character. The acidity lifts the whole wine deliciously.
Round and lush, with boldly oaky notes of caramelized nuts and vanilla accenting tropical fruit. Drink now.
Firm in tannins, mouthwatering in acids, and bone dry, this is a wine to hold for a while. The vineyard consistently yields rich, complex Pinots from various wineries, and Siduri again captures its essence as they have for many years. The wine, which is one of Siduri's ripest, shows wild forest cherry, raspberry, cola and spice flavors, with a feral quality suggesting grilled wild mushrooms and balsam. Give it 2–3 years.
Equal parts Syrah and Merlot (40%), this wine is finished off with Pinot Noir. Vanilla, baking spice, licorice, woodspice and cherry aromas lead to plump, tart cranberry flavors that linger. The wood is heavy at times, which is a shame as the balance of the fruit is spot on.
Produced in the Aube region, this ripe full wine is rich and generous. With apple and pear fruitiness and a smooth creamy mousse, the wine has just the right amount of bottle aging. Drink now.
A tough wine, it reveals its tannins first. It has potential richness, but there is a dry character that also comes through. The fruit—black plums and berries—shows a jammy sweetness.
Attractive, zingy wine, full of lemon zest acidity, crisp green apples and clean, pure fruitiness. It has just a hint of pepper, layering the creamy final taste. Screwcap.
Rich new wood and fruit combine well in this concentrated wine. Flavors go right through to give mint, blackberry and dark plum fruits. The tannins are already integrated to give a wine that will be ready to drink in two years.
This smells like a toasted peanut butter sandwich that's layered with oxidized apples and baked pineapple. The palate is full and unctuous, with mild acids adding slight lift. It finishes with bright, apple-like acidity and a warm, nutty flavor.
A creamy, ripe wine, with some vanilla aromas and flavors of plums and ripe peaches. In Styria,  Chardonnay is also known, confusingly, as Morillon. Imported by Austrian Specialty Wine Company.
After light scents of butter and spiced apple surface, the wine turns briny and pickled, both in aromas and flavors. It feels fleshy on the finish, with briny stone-fruit and citrus flavors.
The picturesque name of the wine, the vineyard where God sits, comes from a monopole—a walled property in the hills behind Beaune, wholly owned by the Château de Santenay. Ripe and smooth with an attractive, crisp texture, the wine is ready to drink. A touch of toast gives extra interest.
A mixture of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petite Sirah, this has a funky smell, and tastes sweet and soft.
Barolo Leon makes a wonderful first impression thanks to its aromas of ripe berry fruit, Indian spice, cola, licorice and ginger. There's deep dimension and personality here and the wine ends with firmly polished tannins.
The second wine of Ausone is powerful with plenty of firm tannins. At the same time, it is ripe, with softness from the fruit and light extraction. It is a very fine wine, delicious with its acidity and its black-currant fruitiness. Drink this wine from 2024.
A lot of raisin and licorice on the nose hint at overripeness, but there's also a fair amount of minty green. The palate feel is wide and chunky, but soft, with prune and baked berry flavors. Raisin, chocolate and coffee are present on the jammy finish.
Melony and sweet smelling, with sticky, strange flavors of chewing gum, melon and pickled citrus rind. Finishes weird, too. Overall, Indomita's wines are outside the lines and hard to enjoy.
So pale that it's almost colorless, the Blangé—made from Arneis grapes in Piedmont—has the oak-meets-citrus nose you'd expect of a Chardonnay. The lemon, grapefruit and pear flavors, coupled with a superspritzy, Asti-like mouthfeel, make this a good Sunday brunch eye-opener. Its slightly high acidity could cut through any French toast or waffle that you throw its way. Finishes medium-long, with herbal notes.
A rare Washington Nebbiolo, from a recently planted Yakima Valley vineyard, this has young vine flavors of berry candy. It's high-toned and slightly volatile, with some heat in the finish.
This has rich tannins, dense fruit and overall deep flavors. This is a dark wine, just this side of brooding, with ripe blueberry and cherry fruit, softly chalky tannins, whiffs of smoke and splashes of pepper. The dark fruit flavors are bold and seamless, melded with smoke and chocolate, dotted with ground espresso, and finished with a nice lift. This probably needs another five years to really show all of its complexity.
Sangiovese is enhanced with 15% Malvasia Nera in this modern, rich wine. It offers sweet cherry renderings backed by blueberry, milk chocolate and molasses. Ripe and chewy in the mouth, the wine's juicy succulence calls out for lamb, beef or game meat.
Cigar box and very ripe strawberry dominate the aromatic profile, though a bit of bell pepper lingers in the background. It's light and racy on the palate, with cherry cola, cedar and mellow tannins, making for a very fresh and fun wine, best served after mild chilling.
Fairly bland on the nose, with only a pinch of mild peach and candle wax. The palate is full but wholly generic in terms of flavors: look for sweet pineapple in front of a soft, almost cloying finish. Drink now.
Apple, sweetness, gardenia and yeast make for a correct and pleasant bouquet. The palate is smooth and full, with crisp green apple and orange flavors leading to a citrusy, lively finish. Good and well made for a standard Cava.
Heavily perfumed Traminer that comes with the faintest pink tinge. The wine has a rich, fragrant character that is shot through with fresher acidity. Try this wine with spicy foods or as a vivid aperitif.
Lemon, orange blossom and rose aromas start this exotic and refreshing wine. On the palate, bright flavors of citrus mingle with melon and pepper. Easygoing but distinctive.
This Cabernet Sauvignon has splashes of Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec. A pretty cherry flavor emerges immediately, with a peppery bite on the finish. It's not supercomplex, but it is very well structured and just right for near-term drinking.
Herbal berry aromas come with oak-based toast and maple notes. This feels pumped up and grabby, with rocky tannins and high acidity. Blackberry and chocolate flavors are forceful, while this Cabernet from a cool vintage shows lasting oak and herbal notes on a wiry yet bulky finish.
Oaky, with harsh flavors of pineapple Lifesaver candy and some sourness in the finish.
This is a rather big, bulky Vacqueyras, but one that doesn't seem to have the flesh to completely carry its size. The modest cherry flavors blend with dark, earthy notes into a tangle of leather and dried fruit. If it fleshes out in another year or two, this rating may prove conservative. Drink now–2018.
A fine, everyday Merlot, although a little rough, but nicely ripe and sweet in raspberry and cherry flavors. It's a country-style wine that will pair well with beef.
Creamy and fresh, this is made from estate-grown grapes, fermented in a mix of stainless steel and neutral barrels. The fruit flavors blend jicama, melon and pear, with a touch of sweetness. It finishes with a hint of honeysuckle.
Ripe tropical fruits dominate this smooth wine, creating a warm, almost New World appeal. There is a toast note that balances the rich fruitiness.
Lemon zest and honeysuckle aromas have a dusty, mineral edge on this bracing Riesling sparkling. Tart tangerine and peach flavors are pristine on the palate, but it's aggressively foamy with a dense, thick wall of froth that lingers.
Shows Dry Creek's ability to produce dry, complex Syrahs of interest and sophistication. You'll find layers of blackberries, currants, bacon, black pepper and sweet, toasty oak, wrapped into strong but pliable tannins. The deliciously fresh fruit suggests popping the cork over the next year or two.
Light aromas of red cherry and cranberry meet with thyme and wild herbs on the reserved nose of this appellation blend. It's energetic and light on the palate, where thyme, marjoram and cedar flavors dominate the red fruit.
Everything feels balanced in this ripe—not overripe—Pinot Noir. It smells like plump black cherry and blackberry, tastes rich but crisp, has firm tannins and acidity for structure, and a long, lingering finish. With medium body, a velvety texture and flavor complexity, this is the complete Pinot package.
Les Fourneaux is one of the smallest premier crus. Rich and balanced, this wine is full of pear and apricot flavors. It combines a minerally edge with a generous structure and fruitiness. Delicious now, but keep it for 3–4 years.
Berry, brown sugar and prune aromas are nice, while the palate is tannic, with a rugged mouthfeel that should be softened by hearty foods. This tastes of plum and dark berry, while the finish is oaky, chocolaty, spicy and strong.
Salty on the palate, this medium-bodied wine is focused in tension and nervy freshness, with a generosity of complex fruit. Lime, pear and fig ride a cool-climate wave of orange peel that lifts the underlying density and concentration at work in this vintage.
A fresh, tangy, vibrant wine that has ripe green plum and apple flavors alongside a layer of full, forward fruit.
Even tasted from magnum, this wine is starting to show its age, revealing smooth tannins and a slightly thinning texture. Meaty notes add spice to the beet and earth aromas and flavors. Drink up.
Aromatic accents here include apple cider, chocolate and cherry. The wine has personality but sings out of tune in places, although it could work well with easy pasta or meat dishes. This expression of the wine has 80% Negroamaro and 20% Malvasia Nera.
Some good red and dark blackberry fruits emerge from concentrated tannins and a firm structure. This wine is made for aging, the juicy Alicante Bouschet character well integrated into the fine texture.
A great, upscale wine to drink now with the best you can pair it with. It shows classic Napa character, with firm, dry tannins, fine acidity and blackberry and black currant flavors. It's almost entirely Cabernet Sauvignon, with tiny additions of other Bordeaux varieties. Give it a good decant, or cellar it for 5–7 years and see what happens.
There's a distinctive, quite appealing sense of salsa, cilantro and parsley on the nose of this Lucas & Lewellen-made blend of 45% Sangiovese, 20% Merlot, 10% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Cabernet Franc, 10% Freisa and 5% Petit Verdot. Pasilla and Fresno chiles play into the palate as well, where red berry fruit is the backbone. Wine geeks will dig this, but casual sippers may be confused.
After the fabulous 2005, Pétrus again has produced a magnificent wine in 2006, even if it doesn't hit quite the same heights. It has an immensely powerful structure and concentration, always the hallmark of this wine. But this structure is almost masked by the superbly ripe and fresh fruit. And with all this weight, there is still a sense of proportion, the rich berry fruits, smokiness and light spice beautifully integrated.
Here's a good, rich, savory young Zin to get those tastebuds whistling. Clean acidity and smooth tannins frame Zinny flavors of wild berries, teriyaki and Asian spices. Drink now.
This Merlot has less than ripe green mint flavors along with the cherries and oak. It's fully dry, with a nice acid-tannin balance.
A terrific kabinett, Loosen's 2007 WS offers slightly smoky, leesy notes upfront, then adds touches of white peach, pear, vanilla and a trace of cinnamon. It's round and lush on the palate, yet racy at the same time, finishing long and sweet, with a citrusy tinge to the flavors.
Nice on the nose, with masculine, dense aromas of ripe berry fruits. The palate begins snappy and gets more sheering as the wine unfolds; in the meantime, the cherry, berry and plum flavors are more compact than candied. Well-done for Bonarda, but slightly narrow and grabbing the more you get to know it.
Pungent and green up front, with a shot of cool-coast pyrazines on the nose, this hits the palate with a lemony blast of citric acid. Flavors of orange and nettle are a touch briny, while a juicy, acidic, peppery finish is racy to the max.
This is a direct, drink-me-now fruity Zinfandel with the flavors of a raspberry-cherry granola bar. There's a sweet, roasted almond and brown sugar edge, with lots of black pepper. Drink now.
Sinewy texture and bright acidity meet a funk of blue cheese and forest in this interestingly complex and affordable wine. The earthiness continues in streaks of tart cranberry that ride along the palate.
Although still young, this wine packs enough ripe fruit and structure to age. It has dark cherry, red plum and smoky bacon flavors that go with a stalky texture and firm tannins. Drink from 2015.
Black cherries, leather, dried rose petals, rustic cinnamon, bloody meat, graphite, cherry cola and vanilla bean show on the wondrously layered nose of this Steve Clifton bottling. It's still a tad young on the palate, which is grippy with sticky tannins, but shows cola, brown spice, cinnamon, cardamom cream, tart plum fruit and a lasting dried mint element. Drink 2018 through 2028.
A big, extracted and, as currently constructed, somewhat ponderous wine that's not showing all that well. Could simply be immature, but it does seem to lack a certain vibrancy. Other than that, it's powerful in blackberry, black cherry and oak flavors, accompanied by strong tannins. Could surprise after, say, 2014.
The first couple of passes are not that encouraging: there's strawberry Kool-Aid and sharp field-like aromas of thistle and bramble. But the palate is not bad at all; it is flush yet racy, with solid raspberry and plum flavors that carry onto the finish. Not a refined wine but a natural one.
Pittnauer's white blend of Chard, Grüner Veltliner and Sauvignon Blanc. Fresh and lightly citric with a touch of fresh white currants. It's soft and easy, with a crisp aftertaste.
This wine delivers notes of forest floor and small berries  backed by clove, green spice, pretty herbal and menthol notes. It's a bit raw and thorny in the mouth but it does offer refreshing crispness and sweet fruit on the finish.
A complex bouquet offers black-cherry, soy, game and anise notes, and opens nicely to an expansive palate with earth and leather notes accenting the fruit. The dark finish, with its coffee and orange-peel notes, shows some of the intrigue of the nose. Beautiful in its youth, it should get even better in a year or two. Beautiful price, too.
While this wine is not powerful, it has elegance to go with the ripe fruit, fresh honey, lemon flavors and a core of dense dryness. With this vintage, Rayne Vigneau seems to be back where its vineyard, next to Yquem, suggests it should be.
While a tad savory and earthy on first whiff, this semi-sweet Riesling is surprisingly fruity on the palate, bursting with concentrated grapefruit and tangerine flavors. It's a satisfying sip that's zesty and tart with lemon-lime acidity.
A very nice Pinot. If it shows no particular complexity, it's has a textbook silky texture, dryness, and flavors of cherries, coffee and oak.
Clean, swift and pure are some of the words that come to mind to describe this wine. Others are moderately fruity (citrus, apple), fresh (almost no oak), and sharply clean, with its high acids that are ideal with appetizers like bruschetta. Why more people haven't discovered Pinot Gris is a mystery.
This traditional blend of five Bordeaux varieties comes across as tight and streamlined, lacking much texture or richness. Cedar, cassis and mint finish crisp.
Here's a soft, generous interpretation of the Nebbiolo grape with plush aromas of milk chocolate, cherry, blackberry, Indian spice and anise seed. This is a linear and elegant wine with a floral-herbaceous finish that works beautifully with the wine's natural acidity and firmness.
With a few years in bottle, this is maturing well. It has ripeness, the tannins beginning to soften into rich spice and damson jelly flavors. The acidity is still very present as is the dry core.
A Rhône-style blend of 65% Syrah, 30% Grenache and 5% Viognier, this was aged entirely in neutral oak, to its benefit. The aromas burst from the glass with fresh ground pepper in the lead, and the Syrah and Grenache seem in perfect balance, each enhancing the other. Vibrant tart cranberry fruit is matched to juicy acids and that ravishing pepper. Pepper steak anyone?
This wine's red apple, flower and lees aromas lead to off-dry, leesy fruit flavors that seem a bit heavy and weighed down.
Composed, correct and minerally on the nose, this wine has typical and attractive pungent-green aromas. It feels zesty and crisp, with cutting acidity in support of grassy, classically Leyda flavors of lime, grapefruit and lemongrass. It's angular but long on the finish.
The blend—Chenin Blanc, Chardonnay and Cabernet Franc—is typical of Loire sparkling wines. It gives a full mousse in the mouth, herbal and green pea flavors, and a soft, creamy aftertaste, backed up by acidity.
Caramel and strawberry aromas lead to a ripe, while still, crisp crushed red berry wine. Good acidity, a light just off-dry texture.
Here's a good everyday Merlot marked by rich fruit and a smooth mouthfeel. Thoroughly dry, it brims with black raspberries, cherries and chocolate-covered raisins.
This blend of 39% Cabernet Sauvignon, 52% Merlot and 9% Cabernet Franc is a jewel; sappy and seductive, loaded with cassis and boysenberry, tart and racy, and defined with sharp tannins. A strong and well-ripened herbal character infuses the red-fruit core, giving the wine length and style; it is just at the edge of showing some heat on the finish. Cellar for 8 to 10 years.
Lots going on in this tasty Syrah. It's rich in berries, cocoa and spices, and has a nice, creamy texture. The alcohol is moderate. Made for drinking now.
Dusty minerals, pollen and spice notes lend complexity to this honey-toned auslese. The palate is decadently sweet, glazed in caramelized sugar and heaving with ripe cantaloupe and peach flavors. A bite of lemon-lime acidity offsets all the opulence, lending edge to a long, lingering finish.
Ripe and decadent, opening with plum pudding, cherry pie and vanilla scents that slide into blueberry and cassis on the palate. A few smooth tannins provide just a bit of grip. Very well done in the style. Serve with hamburgers fresh off the grill. Drink now to one year.
Ripe pink grapefruit aromas and flavors are almost red-berryish, really, but balanced by crisp acids. Plump in the mouth and very easy to drink, this should be a picnic staple. Imported by Total Beverage Solution.
While bottled for four years now, this Cabernet is still developing bottle-aged notes. It's rich and jammy with blackberries, blueberries, cherries and mocha, along with a good overlay of oak. It's a pleasant wine to drink over the next few years.
This is bone dry, light as a feather and as simple and basic as only Merlot can be. It hints at flavors of rhubarb and bark, with all its components balanced out, but offers no depth or nuance.
Aromas of butterscotch, toasted oak, roasted coffee and espresso follow through to the palate along with notes of black pepper. There's not enough fruit richness to stand up to the astringent, woody tannins.
You can smell and taste the damp, cool, forest countryside of the Russian River Valley in this wine. Flavors of earth, mushroom, decaying tree bark and pine needle are all present, and the notes of cherry, cola and pomegranate are intense. It's fairly tannic, with a crisp edge of acidity. Drink now–2015.
It's not clear that Dry Creek Valley is the ideal home for Merlot. This winery's bottlings have been good but earthy, tannic and dry in the past. This one represents a step foward. There's something elegant about it, and the cherry and mocha-tinged flavors certainly are pleasurable. Drink now.
A really good, complex Chard, at the forefront of this varietal's development in California. Combines ripe flavors of sweet, spicy tropical fruits with cool-climate acidity and structure to produce an addictively drinkable, delicious wine. The oak is thickly applied, but perfectly in balance. A desert island wine: If you could bring only one with you...
Stone, lime salt and lemon zest pique the entry of this medium-bodied white, which is well-integrated in terms of oak. High in citrus flavor and pear, it has a gritty texture that gives it added complexity.
While super light in color and texture, this old-vine Zinfandel is undaunting, with a subtle intermingling of jammy cherry and mint flavors. Made to commemorate McFadden's 40 years of farming, it's a throwback in color and personality to a different time and place in Zinfandel.
This herbal, lightly earthy wine coveys aromas like thyme and parsley, but takes several minutes to open up. Flavors are subtle and citrusy and the texture smooth, with medium body.
Sourced from a vineyard near Limoux, this Pinot leads with aromas of red cherry, raspberry leaf and a touch of blackberry. The mouthfeel is light and accessible, with soft tannins and berrylicious flavors that dominate the palate.
Sourced from a family-farmed vineyard first planted in the late 1800s, this brawny, robust 100% varietal red offers meaty black pepper and baked plum along a stewy, spicy backdrop of full-bodied ripeness and weight. The tannins are sizable yet soft, making for a food-friendly wine.
A fascinating dry wine made from a 3.6 acre parcel in the Sauternes appellation, planted with Sémillon vines dating back to 1929. While it is very young, it shows great potential with spice, apricot and peach fruit and just a touch of honey. It will develop well and should be left until 2018.
Smooth and round, this wine offers rich cherry cordial and milk chocolate flavors—a simple, straightforward layering of ripeness within a medium-bodied frame.
89-91 Firmly structured, while also boosted with sweet, smoky fruits and ripe tannins. The wine has style more than power, and the juicy berry fruits give it acidity and a fresh aftertaste.
This is a maturing, wood-aged wine, with smooth plum fruit and tannins, now maturing well. Through aging, a more tarry character is revealed, with some smokiness, while maintaining a ripe, wood-laden feel. Ready to drink now.
Made from fruit that's sourced from the northern Côte Chalonnaise, this structured wine shows crisp acids and bright yellow fruits, with a sense of richness that comes from the vanilla and apricot flavors. The finish is laced with refreshing acidity.
Pinay is a tight and defined red blend from northern Italy with bright accents of cherry cola, forest berry, licorice and dark mineral. There's a sharp, sour note on the close that would pair with smoked cheese.
Slightly sharp but snappy enough to keep you interested. Flavors of red apple, raspberry and plum control the palate, while moderately hard tannins on the finish seem to stretch and thin the wine.
This is a bright, cherry-flavored wine. It has an attractive tannic edge to the ready-to-drink fruitiness. The acidity at the end gives the wine a good lift.
A pretty good Pinot Noir, not quite up there with J's vineyard-designated bottlings, but it's not as expensive. With brisk acidity and black cherry, cola and cedar flavors, it's made for drinking now.
Jumpy berry aromas are simple and grapy. A plump but jagged and tannic palate tastes foxy and a touch herbal, while foresty, minty-green-berry flavors carry a scratchy finish.
A sleek mix of tart berry, stem and herb, along with a hint of oak and chocolate, this is a fair value in a widely available, drink-now Oregon Pinot. The wine oak-aged for six months, whether in neutral or re-staved is not indicated.
A lightly smoky aroma shows the wood aging of this wine. It is toasty, with a mineral touch, and the ripe yellow fruits are developing well. Smooth and potentially rich, this needs a few more months to show at its best. Drink from 2015.
This is a bit hard and aggressive now, with a punch of green tannins. That makes it hard to appreciate the underlying oaky, ripe blackberry and currant fruit. It doesn't seem to have the inherent balance necessary for aging, so give it a decanting and drink it now.
Drawn from the company's holdings in the Awatere Valley, this is a medium-bodied, supple Pinot Noir. A sturdy frame of cedar and mocha surrounds mouthwatering cherry fruit. Drink now–2018.
This ageable wine has sturdy tannins and is a shade too young to drink now. A few years of cellaring will open up the blackcurrant and olive flavors and soften the mouthfeel. If you must open it, try with a perfectly grilled lambchop.
This is a luscious, young Cabernet that's filled with blackberry and cherry jam flavors, with a touch of overripe prune. It doesn't seem like an ager, but it's dry, and shows classically rich, smooth Napa tannins.
A nice follow-up to the excellent '08 Zardoz, this is earthy and roasted smelling, full of cola and berry notes on the nose. It feels round and smooth, with a mild tannic bite and baked flavors of blackberry, cassis and chocolate. It's layered feeling on the finish, with a bit of syrupy residue.
All over the map. There's maple, acetone and candy on the nose, and the fruit flavors morph from sweet to sugary sweet to artificial all in one sip. Saving graces come in the cinnamon and cocoa powder nuances.
Nervy and racy, this has crisp acidity and a lively orange-zest texture. It's fruity, with upfront apple and grapefruit flavors, showing just a touch of a minerally character in the background.
Cherry candy and cola aromas emerge from the nose of this simple, but very bright Ripasso. There's a tiny hint of dried apple skin or citrus at the back and the wine is smooth and lively on the close.
The color is already fading into brick around the rim, and this light Merlot is already drinking at or near its peak. It's soft and smooth, slightly nutty, with round and mature fruit flavors of cherry and berry. All in all it's a pleasant, lightly toasty wine with no rough edges.
Perfumed, with acidity and fresh fruit layering a core of the driest tannin. Spice shows through, but so does the spirit, giving an unbalanced aftertaste.
This ripe, polished blend combines Zinfandel's spicy, briary quality with Syrah's peppery nobility. The wine is soft in both acids and tannins, and very flavorful, with exotic tastes of raspberries, root beer, chocolate mint and raisins.
A little too ripe and raisiny, but not a bad Merlot, with a plush, velvety texture. There's good plum, black currant and smoky oak flavor, and the wine is dry and balanced. Drink now.
A rich golden color, this unctuous offering is luxuriously layered in honeycomb and vanilla crème brûlée, complex, big and bold. A wall of oak adds structure and density without taking over, opening the door to a finish of juicy ripe fig.
Made with 65% Chardonnay, 15% Sauvignon, 10% Pinot Grigio and 10% Pinot Bianco, this elegant white offers aromas of white flower, tropical fruit, mint and whiffs of toasted oak. The structured palate delivers Golden Delicious apple, vanilla, oak and lemon zest. A mineral note closes the lingering finish.
Made by David Ramey, this blend of 80% Zinfandel, 11% Alicante and 9% Petite Sirah impresses in its fruit-forward approachability and all-around likability. Earthy, it teases in dark cherry, vanilla and milk-chocolate flavors, the texture smoothly etched in fine leather.
A note of waxy honeycomb glazes the nose and palate of this lusciously ripe dry Riesling. Its rich almost oily mouthfeel is deeply satisfying, but balanced keenly with spurts of bright white grapefruit and lemon zest. Its finish is long and penetrating, marked by complexities of saffron and pollen.
Pleasant pear and melon notes, a light- to medium-weight feel on the palate and a crisp, citrusy finish add up to a decent simple quaff. Drink now.
This great-value SB from Lake County hits it out of the park on all sorts of fronts, including price. It's got subtle aromatics of pear and lemon, and is a little generic and simple, but at $10 it's so perfectly drinkable who cares? All in a colorful package. Best Buy.
Reductive aromas take the lead and distract from the notes of apple and citrus. It drinks off dry with an elegant styling.
Merry Edwards has had a long relationship with this Westside Road vineyard, which has given her some very great wines. This 2010 continues her offering of delicious Pinots of early appeal, but whose structural integrity guarantees ageability. The wine is lush in raspberries, cherries and currants, yet is elegant and crisp in acidity. You can drink it now, but it will gain in the bottle after 2018.
Numerous lively aromas kick off this bottling, from black currant and purple flower to savory smoke and black peppercorn. The palate is framed by buoyant acidity and chalky tannins, which hold up rich black cherry, clove, licorice and mocha flavors.
Landmark's Chardonnays have been getting sweeter and simpler over the years, perhaps in an attempt to appeal to the popular palate. With the 2011 Lorenzo, they have produced a ripe, oaky, buttery Chard, with orange and pineapple jam, vanilla, honey and fresh cream flavors, made for drinking now.
From a vineyard in the Fort Ross-Seaview appellation, this is clearly one of the best wines of the vintage. The mouthfeel is light and silky, with refined tannins that give it a slight astringency. The flavors are vast and complex with raspberries, cherries and cola, but also forest notes of mushrooms, balsam and herbs. The acidity is fresh and appealing. It's gorgeous now, and should evolve over the next 15 years.
A dark, brooding style of tannic Douro wine. It is lean initially, with a strong mineral character and firm black plum-skin flavors plus leather and tight acidity. When it opens out, this becomes a great value from the Douro.
Fresh lemon perfume juxtaposes delicate toast and spice notes on this briskly balanced yet full-bodied Chardonnay. It's not deeply penetrating, but crisp apple and pear flavors brighten the palate. The finish lingers on a silken vanilla tone. Drink now through 2021.
Leathery aromas include notes of raisin, plum, prune and vanilla. This feels full but a touch chunky and obtuse. Savory, roasted berry and plum flavors include notes of salt and spice, while the finish is spicy, savory and oaky in character.
Soft and gentle, but rich in cherry and red currant flavors, this has the rich, umami flavor of a lightly salted and peppered rare hamburger. Pair it with a burger, and leave off the cheese.
Rhubarb and peach pie flavors are at work in this pleasant rosé. It's clean and refreshing, with just the right profile for that leftover holiday turkey or ham.
Darkly colored wine, with flavors as rich as the color. It has opulent new wood and black plum fruit flavors, the acidity offering a succulent aspect as well as dense tannins and ripe power. It does need aging, but could well develop quickly.
Crisp without being overly racy, this mostly tank-fermented Chardonnay features bright, citrusy fruit with just hints of oak. A food-friendly style at an affordable price. Imported by Lauber Imports.
This biodynamic vineyard delivers a robust mix of flavors for the price. Licorice, coffee liqueur, smoke, char and chocolate-coated cherries are all included. The wine seems to float across the palate, without much weight, but the flavors persist, clean and interesting. Principally, it's Tempranillo (81%), but the Syrah pulls it together.
Fastened with a yellow bottle cap, this is an informal, cool Prosecco that is low in alcohol and long in charm. Easy to drink, it presents pretty floral aromas followed by flavors of straw, herbs, lime and honey. Light and clean in the mouth, it makes an excellent cocktail wine.
A very fruity, berry-filled Zin that's reminiscent of strawberry pie, or maybe even shortcake. Very sweet, it still struggling for balance.
Spice, citrus and minerals typify the nose and palate of this fun white. Soft in style and easy drinking, it will pair well with salads, fruit and seafood.
A concentrated, intense wine, filled with cherry-berry fruit and more than a hint of vanilla. It's tart and edgy, with some firm tannins on the finish, so hold it another 12 months and then drink it over the next 5–6 years.
Lots to like in this 100% Cabernet. It's rich in red and black currants, cassis and chocolate flavors and fully dry, with a fine minerality that adds to the structure. But the alcohol is on the high side, and it feels too soft for balance. Drink soon.
This wine is fruity and soft, with hints of citrus and herbal flavors. Its acidity is bright and attractive. Drink now.
Smoky sweet plum aromas lead to a well structured Burgundy. It has ripe fruit and a layer of fine tannins. The acidity is perhaps high, a product of 2008. Screw cap.
Bright melon and lime zest aromas lead to lightly sweet, broad, fleshy fruit flavors in this wine. It's not entirely representative of the variety but still brings a lot of freshness and appeal.
This bright Moscato d'Asti delivers pure expressions of both the fragrant Moscato grape and the special territory in northern Italy that shaped this delicate dessert wine. Floral aromas of honeysuckle and jasmine are presented in a compact, elegant manner thanks to the temperate growing conditions in Piedmont. The finish is creamy, frothy and rich.
From vineyards in the southern Minho, close to the Douro Valley, this blend of Loureiro and Arinto is rich and full in the mouth. It has spice from wood aging as well as crisp apple and pear flavors that are laced with pink grapefruit. Drink from 2016.
This estate-grown, single-vineyard Pinot Blanc is succulent, tart and tangy, with lightly spicy citrus, kiwi and starfruit flavors. The lingering finish, lightly flecked with dried herbs, shows amazing grip and texture, with a mineral ridge across the mid palate. Great elegance and length.
Soft notes of green bell pepper, nettle and grass give this a fresh aspect. The slender palate then adds lemon, giving a focused zestiness, with glimpses of boxwood. The wine is citric, slender and very refreshing.
Shows sugary flavors of apricots, grilled pineapples and vanilla that have a troubling vegetal edge.
Gritty berry aromas come with a strong dosage of olive, tobacco and old-school Chilean green herbs. The wine has a linear feel and herbal flavors of plum mixed with bell pepper and olive. Pointy acidity makes the finish a bit rough and scouring.
Roasted gamy berry and spice aromas are vintage Salta. This feels potent and grabby, but well balanced. Roasted berry flavors match the nose, while this offers notes of chocolate, mint and herbs. The finish is strong, a bit hot and demanding, but overall this full-force Malbec is on the money.
This Zinfandel is high in alcohol, soft and alluring. It takes Zin's briary, brambly personality and whips it into Cabernet-like balance. There are varietally correct berry-cherry flavors, containing a touch of raisins, chocolate and lots of exotic spices.
Very ripe notes of yellow pear appear on the nose. A touch of earthiness adds texture and interest to the palate, as does the merest smidgen of residual sweetness, boosting the fruit flavors. A zesty freshness pulls all into focus. The finish is dry and lasting.
Here's a toasty, rich blend of various grapes including Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Nero and Refosco that shows well evolved aromas of spice, dusty mineral, candied fruit, plum and prune. It shows firm, smooth texture and would pair with meatloaf or roast beef.
This is a deliciously fruity, nutty Roussanne-Marsanne-Viognier blend with a marzipan-like flavor. It has a light texture, good balance and a deep, honey finish, proving to be a great example of what the Sierra Foothills can do with Rhône varieties.
The nose is rich with Red Delicious apple notes. The palate adds lemon freshness and a tangy, slightly bitter but appetizing streak of zestiness. The finish is restrained, just dry and clean.
Soft and round, with more exotic fruit characters. This is ripe, the acidity well integrated. Citrus and toast mix with ripe apricot and pineapple. It exudes the more seductive side of this famous brand, now mature, but still very much alive.
Another wine in what we have come to call the “black-beauty” style. It has heavily toasted oak, espresso, black cherry and menthol aromas and flavors. The fruit seems subdued here, but the wine is nevertheless well integrated, with a full mouthfeel and long finish. One of the best of this style; cellar it for four to six years, and it should drink nicely to 2010.
Lightly honeyed, this off-dry wine is complex while also fruity. Intense flavor fills the mouth with spice, yellow fruits, pineapple and a touch of mango. The fruits are balanced by the more nuanced honey and spice character that is finished with acidity. Gros Manseng, a native grape of this region, is worth getting to know. Drink this delicious wine from 2016.
The aromatics on this bottling are stunning, with elegant and fresh layers of violet, boysenberry and black raspberry. The sip is tightly woven and graceful, with tart black-raspberry fruit and white pepper leading into a lengthy finish that's supported by slow-rising tannins. This will evolve well in the years to come.
Made from 100% Cabernet grapes grown in this highly regarded vineyard that straddles Atlas Peak, this is dry, full bodied and softly rich in tannins. It has a fruity essence and a toasty sweetness that's driven by the oak, making it delicious.
A very nice Zin that shows classic attributes at an everyday price. Dry, tannic and rich, it has berry, currant, carob and spice flavors with a strong streak of black pepper. Drink now.
The nose on this blend of Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Carmenère is herbal and a touch mulchy, with berry, coffee and olive aromas. The palate feels thick and on the cusp of syrupy, with baked, creamy black-fruit flavors that bring carob, chocolate and herbs accents to a modest finish. This is ripe in feel but still smells and tastes a bit herbal.
Only their second vintage of Finger Lakes Riesling, Long Island's Macari Vineyards makes quite a splash with this beautifully honeyed yet dry and fruitful wine. Richly textured with notes of yellow freesia and preserved peach, it finishes elegantly on a subtly astringent black tea note.

A blend of 70% Sangiovese, 20% Merlot and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon, this opens with aromas of underbrush, scorched earth and espresso. The evolved palate offers coffee, toast and dried black cherry set against mouth-puckering tannins that grip the finish.
Spicy and showing some sweetness around the edges, presumably from a bit of residual sugar. Lovely fruit is the highlight here, textural and luscious with flavors of pears and apricots. Vivid acidity cuts through the fleshy core.
There's a ripe note of blackberry jam at the start that is followed by savory tones of cured meat and dried tobacco. Bold, inky and dense, this would pair with steak and green pepper sauce.
On first take, this is reduced and flat smelling, but with time it evolves to show raisin, licorice and herbal aromas. The palate is jammy, full and loud. Flavors of prune, raisin and blackberry are herbal and feral in nature, while the finish is acidic and full of chunky, herbal flavors. Drink through 2017.
This wine has a crystalline clarity both in its color and its palate impressions. Light and elegant, it offers highlights of rose petals and raspberries, pinpoint acids and polished tannins.
The wine seems flat. It has the red fruits and acidity, but they seem flabby and dull.
This wine is definitely on the herbal side, but it's also suave and silky, with refined notes of tobacco, cedar and cassis. Medium bodied and elegant, even if the flavors are a touch green.
While the tannins here are dry, this wine has enough fruit to show its potential. Blackberry flavors are ripe, cut with acidity and a juicy texture. The wine needs time, so drink from 2017. Enologist Sebastien and vineyard manager Nicolas are the latest generation managing the Carreau family estates.
A smooth, fruity wine, it has a light layer of tannins to shape the red fruit flavors. It has great poise, fresh acidity, with a structure already well integrated into the fruitier element. Drink now.
There's not much Sauvignon Blanc grown in this cool region of the Russian River Valley, which makes this bottling a curiosity. It has excellent acidity and is flavorful in Meyer lemon, lime, vanilla and honeysuckle flower flavors, but is a little too sweet to earn a higher score.
An invitingly perfumed wine, its fruit bursting with citrus intensity. It has bright, very textured and mineral structure offering aging potential. There is a lively, vivid aftertaste.
This has a savory nose of worn leather, herb and leaf litter that's offset by decadent notes of wild berry doused with pastry batter. Medium to full bodied, it has a soft core that's outlined by well-built tannins. It finishes with traction and touches of chai spice and licorice.
Aromas of maple and sweet hickory smoke emerge through the waves of purple fruit and lilacs on the nose of this small-batch blend of 52% Grenache, 27% Syrah and 21% Mourvèdre. The flavors are well integrated on the sip, with tangy boysenberry, a pinch of sage and crushed black-pepper spice, with a strong acidity that rises in the midpalate.
A very lush, fruity wine, if a bit soft, with flavors of pineapples, lemon custard, buttered toast and smoky vanilla. Satisfies for its richness and creamy texture.

Soft and fruity, this is a lemon-scented wine that has an attractive tang of minerality. The texture is laced with acidity, with a nervous energy. It's fresh and ready to drink.
Madre is a 50-50 blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet from one of Montalcino's best producers. It delivers a full rack of spicy aromas as well as fresh fruit and forest berry. However, in this vintage the emphasis is placed on the wine's solid structure.
Despite its soft entry and lightly chocolaty finish, this wine tastes unripe. There is a bitter, green tea flavor running through the tannins, and the characteristic high acidity of the Sangiovese grape is exaggerated to the point of taking over.
This wine is spicy and brooding on the nose, with dark forest berries and herbal tea aromas rising from the glass. The palate follows suit, offering additional notes of wildflowers and tart black currant. With 20 months in American oak, this red shows ample weight, supported by ripe tannins and balanced by a driving acidity.
Slightly sweet, with a honeyed edge to the rich pear, apple, peach and tropical fruit flavors. Just-in-time acidity fortunately provides balance.
Raw and minty green, with herbal flavors and an overlay of oak.
Sharp, minty-peppery and tannicly dry in its youth, this Syrah is rich enough in fruit to warrant some years in the cellar. That could give it time to soften and let the ripe blackberry, chocolate, coffee and gingersnap cookie flavors out. Try 2009–2011.
A forward, fruity red, coming through strongly on black currant, red fruits and soft tannins. It shows its wood aging easily, leaving an aftertaste that has light acidity. Drink now and until 2019.
Thick as molasses and dark as caramelized brown sugar, the wine oozes out of the bottle releasing concentrated aromas of butterscotch, toffee, honey, licorice, coffee, resin and maple syrup. Grapes from the Montepulciano area are dried in a ventilated room and the wine ages over 10 years in tiny oak barrels resulting in thick, dark concentration. Don't pair it with food: Vin Santo as good as this deserves to be enjoyed alone, as a so-called “meditation wine.”
A leaner, meaner red with plush undercurrents of cigar smoke, ash, granite rock and bright red fruit in the background. This is unmistakably a wine from the volcanic soils of the mighty Mount Etna. It has medium body, and firm, dusty tannins. Imported by Vino Bravo.
Crossing borders and grapes to make a compelling wine, this blend is 70% Cabernet Sauvignon from Dr. Crane Vineyard and Kenefick Ranch, and 30% Syrah from Kick Ranch in Sonoma County. Intensely ripe, it allows for a softly sculpted structure adorned in coffee bean, black licorice, black pepper and currant, enticing the best of all worlds.
Fruit-salad aromas include a note of chewing gum. This feels basic, with tart vapid tomato flavors. A saucy-tasting finish is bland as a board.
Dense aromas of smoked black plum, rustic leather and smoked meats show on this super Tuscan blend of Sangiovese, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Petite Sirah. Dried blueberries, fudge, beef char and very tarry elements show on the palate.
The cool Côte de Lechet, facing north, produces a classically steely Chablis. This is still young, very tight and nervy, its acidity prominent even though the texture is ripe. Aging will bring balance between the crisp character and the richer green and white fruits. Drink from 2018.
Too sharply acidic and jammy in cherries and raspberries, with a hard scour of tannins. It's tasty, but unsophisticated, even for Petite Sirah. Could surprise with lots of time in the cellar, but will never outgrow its rustic personality.
Rich, ripe and round, this lush take on Roussanne is loaded with cantaloupe, sweet pineapple and Meyer lemon fruit flavors. The fruit is brought forward by a small amount of residual sugar, which seems like an enhancement in this instance. The finish has just a hint of honey cough drop—sweet and slightly minty.
Stemmy and leathery smelling, with heat, roasted fruit and cheesy aromas. The palate is full but soupy, with roasted, baked black fruit flavors. A bit of cinnamon and spice help out the finish, but by then the wine's very average fate has been sealed.
This sweet, fortified dessert wine is very Port-like. It has remarkable structure with dark tannins that encase jammy blackberry flavors. It's full bodied, but brightened with acidity. Ready to drink now, it would be an ideal after-dinner drink.
With its crisp apple fruit and touch of citrus, this initially seems to be merely fruit. Then, slowly, richness and a sense of maturity emerge to create a wine that is complex, full and rich. Open this an hour before pouring.
A very good wine, glamorous in the way of Oakville Cabernets, with beautiful tannins and flavors of blackberries and cassis. But it's also very oaky, with a caramel and wood char sweetness that's a little too dominant. Doesn't seem like an ager.
Big but polished, this full-bodied wine almost bursts with dark berry and bittersweet-chocolate flavors that are laced with lighter, spicier oak nuances. It tames the overtly tannic grape variety and shapes it into a bold and very appealing style.
A complex, ageworthy wine, this is powered by its tannins, its dark berry fruits and the layers of wood aging. It's rich and sweet, the fruit balancing the structure and given a fresh touch with black currant acidity. Drink from 2017.
Here's a big, flashy, cult-style wine if ever there was one. It offers masses of blackberries, black currants, coffee, spices and new oak. Vastly rich, it defines the Harlan Estate style, although, in this vintage, perhaps not quite at its highest expression. Nonetheless the wine is fat and unctuous and immediately drinkable, thanks to refined tannins. Yet it should age effortlessly through 2018.
Slightly more chunky and dusty than lively, with dry apple aromas and not much else. The palate offers a medium level of intensity and flavors of melon, banana and white pepper. Turns drier and more soda-like on the finish. Good but a little short on flavor.
Fans of old-style Tuscan wines, take note. This easy-to-like wine has plummy-cherry fruit flavors wrapped in a leathery skin. Some barnyard and cola are apparent on the nose, while sweet tannins coat the palate. Imported by 57 Main Street Wine Co.
This straightforward wine opens with scents of prune, blue flower, coffee and resin. The aromas follow through to the round, accessible palate along with fleshy blackberry and a hint of anise. Drink through 2016.

This 100% Pinot Nero opens with aromas of red currant, rose petal and a whiff of graphite. The savory palate offers strawberry and red cherry alongside smooth tannins. Enjoy soon.
Aromas of baked dark-skinned fruit, cedar, cooking spice and a balsamic note unfold in the glass. A blend of 75% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Sangiovese, and 5% Cabernet Franc, the firmly structured palate delivers ripe black currants, dried black cherries, clove, mint, tobacco and anise alongside tightly woven but fine-grained tannins. Give this time to unwind and fully develop. Drink 2017–2023.
The lightest pink in color, this delicacy translates into the pure Chardonnay of the Champagne itself which has Pinot Noir added to give color and just a touch of red-fruit flavors.
This solid Merlot begins with savory aromas of cloves, black cherry, and smoke, leading into like flavors in a structured, spirited package. The wine could continue to age, but makes for a good sip now. Pair with smoked meats, roasted duck.
Crisp, round and spicy, this has dominating flavors of apples and pears. A green plum flavor and pure acidity complement the finish.
You can recognize the Sagrantino grape instantly, even when it is present in small quantities. This Montefalco Rosso is comprised of 70% Sangiovese, 15% Sagrantino and 15% Colorino and shows a dark color with rich berry and spice aromas. The fresh acidity would pair with pasta with cheese or cream.
Ripe banana, coconut, mango and guava aromas make for a showy entry in this bottling, but citrusy freshness keeps it in check. The palate show a clean line of lemony acidity that sears into the finish, cutting through hints of more tropical fruit.
At the age of four-plus years, this bone dry Cabernet still is tannic and sharp, with green, unripe flavors of mint and peppercorn. It's classically structured, but not going anywhere.
Underbrush, scorched earth, menthol and plum steeped in spirits are some of the aromas that unfold on the glass. The big, chewy palate doles out ripe wild cherry, raspberry jam, ground pepper and licorice alongside firm, velvety tannins. You'll also detect the warmth of alcohol on the finish.
This fresh wine also offers plenty of ripe fruit and exotic flavors. Crisp, juicy and rich, it's just lightly touched by honey and is a refreshing wine to drink now.
This dark and brawny Brunello shows distant whiffs of cured meat, curry leaf, campfire and brimstone to frame its bright cherry essence. Silky tannins and lean fruit consistency is followed by bright, zippy freshness.
Minty and heavily oaked, with creamy aromas of vanilla bean, milk chocolate and raisiny sweetness. The palate smacks down with a tight, rubbery feel and then unleashes heavy, toasty flavors of herbal berry fruit, raw oak and mocha. Good for a rich, robust wine but it doesn't excel and it seems a little out of balance.
Harsh and pruny, with overripe flavors that are like Port, except the wine is dry. Wildly over-priced for the quality.
Fresh but lightweight, this wine has pleasant green fruits and crisp acidity. There is some structure, but it seems as if  the fruit wasn't ripe enough.
Blue-flower and red-berry aromas lead the way along with a whiff of eucalyptus. The firm palate offers hints of star anise, espresso and a green note of powdered sage that back up unripe red cherry. It closes on a coffee note.
Supersaturated, so much so that it's opaque, with blackberry, horseradish and chocolate aromas. In the mouth, it's on the cusp of overextraction but manages to toe the line. Flavors of roasted berry, coconut and bitter chocolate are dark and lead to a tannic finish. Drink now through 2014.
An elegant wine, with moderate 13.6% alcohol, brambly berry fruit, and a wash of finishing acidity. The restrained (30%) new French oak can be sensed in the lightly chocolaty finish. It's nice to be able to call an Oregon Pinot charming, as this one is, rather than volcanic.
Good example of a clean, proper Viognier at a relatively affordable price. It's crisp and elegant, showing the variety's lush side, with tropical fruit, wildflower, buttered toast, sweet cream and vanilla flavors.
This is an immensely fun albeit simple, Beaujolais-like wine, best served chilled and on the beach or by a pool. Fairly dark in color, it shows deep blackberry, smoke, crushed graphite and a touch of tarragon on the nose, while the flavors offer Concord grape, plum, fruit punch and a touch of caramel.
Based on the Roêda vineyard, this opulent, fruity wine is dense, beautifully ripe, a powerhouse of sweet fruit, figs and raisins, plum jelly and the roundest, most generous tannins. It's a wine that will show well in the next few years, but which should age magnificently.
This new Malbec is a soft, fruity, extremely dark wine, with scents of raisins and pretty fruit flavors of boysenberries and black cherries, with lighter streaks of coffee and caramel woven through. The balance is excellent, though the wine does not show the depth of flavor that is expressed in its inky dark colors.
Tannic and unyielding now, this Syrah is full-bodied and soft, with cola, blackberry tea, bitter chocolate and leather flavors. It's a young, fresh, very dry wine, with a complex, chewy mouthfeel. The tannins suggest upscale red meats and fine cheeses.
This is a shockingly good wine. The aromas draw you into the glass, with vibrant notes of capers and Kalamata olives, brine, smoke meat, mineral, black pepper and earth. The fruit and savory flavors—speckled by black and green olive notes throughout—show a compelling sense of texture and richness. It's a savory delight.
A beautifully fragrant wine, with full berry fruits and a floral character. The wine is given backbone by the structure and deliciously pure acidity. It's a wine for serious aging, still very young. Drink from 2017.
There's an unripe, vegetal taste that mars this Pinot. It's dry and silky, with raspberry and cherry flavors, but there's an unwelcome note of asparagus.
Cadaretta's largest production red is drinking beautifully in this exceptional vintage.

Complex and detailed, its tannins are grainy and dark, adding heft and gravitas to the fruit.
Smoky and toasty, this is a structured wine. It has layers of black currant fruits, fresh acidity as well as firm tannins that overlay the juicy fruitiness. It needs to age. Drink from 2016.

Bitter cherries with some yeastiness give this wine a rich, while tight, character. It has a touch of vanilla, ripe red-berry fruits and an almond aftertaste. Drink now.
Though the bottle is incredibly heavy—a bit much for Pinot—the wine is surprisingly lithe and velvety, with inviting aromatics of cherry and spice. Layered and tamely voluptuous, this is a tremendous, tiny-production Pinot from an unlikely place—Humboldt County—a place with clear potential in this producer's hands.
Fenestra is making a boatload of small-production varieties from Livermore and Lodi, this one from its estate in the Livermore Valley where it's pulled off a stunning version of Mourvèdre, fairly low in alcohol (13.9%) and yet surprising with a black pepper nose, hint of maple, blackberry and baked plum that's drinking great right now.
Organic wine from this family winery in Auersthal. It has deliciously fresh fruit, flavors of white plums and just a touch of grapefruit. Concentrated, with a delicious finish.

A blend of Cabernet, Merlot and Limnio, this is a Bordeaux-like blend offering aromas of clove, mint and blueberry, and black fruit flavors.

This estate-grown wine mixes earthy strawberry and raspberries against a tannic backbone that lends plenty of strength. Let it unwind a while in the glass.

Bordeaux chateau owner Bernard Magrez has moved into Provence with this soft fruity wine. It is well balanced, with red fruits and gentle acidity giving a wine that makes a great apéritif style. Drink now.
A little harsh, hot and peppery for a Pinot Noir, with cherry, smoke and spice flavors. But it could mellow out in a year or so, and certainly improves with airing in the glass.
The wine's cherry and spice flavors reach a good balance and create a solid wall of taste and flavor. This is not a subtle or intricate wine, but it is a fruit-forward, juicy expression of Montepulciano with chewy tannins and good succulence.
The wine in this 100% Pinot Noir comes from one of the top villages in the Montagne de Reims. It is rich, structured and with a youthful character despite its nine years . It has berry and rich plum fruits as well as a dry core of acidity. Drink this ageworthy Champagne from 2019.

Apple and melon aromas are followed by medium-weight flavors. The concentration seems a bit watery in the midpalate but the variety is unmistakable and the balance is there.
Technically off dry, with 14 g/L residual sugar, this also boasts substantial acidity. The ripe fruits include spicy apple, Meyer lemon and orange marmalade, with a round, food-ready mouthfeel.
A thick wine that doesn't bring the ripeness, sweetness and balance that's necessary. The nose is filled with milk chocolate, mint and cough syrup, while the palate is surprisingly tangy and sharp, with cranberry and wild raspberry flavors.
Tannic, thick and mired in tar and oak, this estate wine has a lack of fruit that puts it off balance.
92-94 Big, firm, with dense tannins that underly the ripe, dark berry and plum skin fruit flavors. Very powerful, the almost shocking acidity a cutting edge of freshness. Hugely juicy aftertaste.
Very rich, if a bit of a letdown after the '07. Shows massively concentrated blackberry, cherry and mocha fruit, and overwhelms by its sheer power, with tannins as finely ground as anywhere on earth. But the finish is rather sweet and jammy, and the wine, good as it is, seems best opened now and for the next six years.
If you are looking for a well-made Oregon Pinot Noir under $20, this is a good choice. Medium bodied, it offers well-ripened red and blue fruits, a lick of toast, well-built tannins, and a finishing streak of dark roasted coffee.

This is a super cuvée from Bourseau with dense dark extracted tannins and concentrated fruits. It is rich, almost too rich, full of powerful fruits, black plum skins and a young firm structure. It will remain dry and tannic for several more years, so don't drink before 2020.
Sharp and sweet-sour, like Chinese moo shu pork sauce, this Malbec has plum and cherry flavors and very high acidity.
While the nose is quite bold, boasting concentrated notes of strawberry leather and caramel, the palate on this delicately framed rosé is demure. It's a bit light in concentration with soft acidity, but an easygoing quaffer for early consumption.
This Syrah is considerably lighter in body than you'd expect for a variety that's often heavy and full bodied. It has the silkiness of a Pinot Noir, and it's dry and complex in wild berry, leather, black pepper and cedar flavors. It shows lots of elegance throughout, and could even pick up bottle notes over the next six years.
A dense wine, rich and smooth for a Nuits-St-Georges, full of ripe red fruits, dark cherries and acidity that almost gives the wine a fresh character. Behind this fruitiness is a more solid, dark structure of tannins that will allow the wine to age. Drink from 2018.
The ninth generation of the Dublois family goes for tight cropping on only 7.5 acres for Nectar (95% Merlot, 5% Cabernet Sauvignon). Layers of wood dominate this wine. However, it does promise fruit as well, shown by the weight and richness. So it's a wine for a pause, to allow the intense spice and new wood flavors to die down. Firm and dry now, it will be worth the wait. Drink from 2018.
Smooth and rich, the first release of the new vintage from Le Cadeau is a gem. Tangy berry/cherry fruit is framed in chocolate, while balancing acidity props up softer, caramel streaks. The finish brings a wash of citrus, leaving the mouth feeling clean and ready to sip again.
This is a rich wine, packed with red-berry fruits. Despite its density and ripe fruits, it has a fine streak of acidity that keeps it lively and crisp.

Pleasant and correct rather than exciting, this Pinot Noir has flavors of cola, root beer, pomegranates, cherries and peppery spices. It's totally dry, with an elegantly silky mouthfeel. Drink now.

This is rich and dry in blackberries, licorice, bacon, sweet oak and peppery spices. It shows lots of acidity and tannins, giving it a firm structure. Give it a brief decant and drink now.
Starts out strong with lemon, apple and other fresh-fruit aromas. The flavors are more mealy and warm, and the palate feel is oily. Citrus, apple, lemon and tropical fruit all make appearances, but overall the wine fades into mediocrity and pithy bitterness.
This is a medium-strength white, richly constructed to show concentrated flavors of vanilla bean, apple and toasted oak.
Here's a classic Barolo that shows impressive freshness for the 2009 vintage. Bright berry and floral aromas and lip-smacking cherry-berry flavors balance firm but fine tannins. Not much complexity, but lovely finesse.

This textbook entry-level Merlot combines plum, mocha and herb shadings in a soft, almost sweet-tasting wine that's sure to be poured by the glass at innumerable restaurants nationwide. There's just enough tannin on the finish to give it the strength to pair with red meats.
Soft, light, flavored with raspberry and red fruit. There is a gentle tannin character to this open, fresh wine.
A tremendously rich, oaky Chard that will blast your socks off and then some. The fruit is really complex, ranging from green apples to savory ripe peaches on into tropical fruit, and there's a dusty sprinkling of cinnamon and ginger. For sur-lie freaks, there's lots of creamy, yeasty, nutty notes contributing to this delicious, hard-hitting wine.
This lacks Pinot's velvety richness, substituting instead an irregular mouthfeel due in part to unripe, green tannins. Makes up for it with a wealth of raspberry and cherry jam flavors and a sweet oak note. Drink now.
A partially (50%) wood-fermented wine that shows a softer side to Fernão Pires, suppressing its natural exuberant freshness while adding complexity, spice and toast. The wine is worth aging a few months, so drink from early 2017.
A little soft in texture, but interesting for its mosaic of blackberry, pepper, smoked meat, currant and balsam flavors, and the way the firm tannins provide structure. This bone-dry, big-boned Syrah was grown in the San Bernabe Vineyard of the southern Salinas Valley.
Opening fragrances suggest lemon blossom and white tree fruit. The palate offers juicy apple, Bartlett pear and citrus alongside fresh acidity that gives a bright finish.
Red cherry and raspberry aromas lead the bouquet, with secondary notes of red currant and savory herb in the backround. This is medium weight, with dusty but gripping tannins and a firm structure.
Thin and simple, with modest strawberry flavors and a watery finish. It's also soft and flabby. Iron Horse's Pinot Noir blush wine, at the same price, is an incomparably better wine.
A classy, consistent wine of the first order. Starts off with delicate floral and melon aromas, the honeysuckle component persisting on through the long finish. It's the wine's minerality, rather than this floral sweetness, that is its highlight. Round and just viscous enough, closing with mineral and white pepper. Imported by Negociants USA, Inc.
There's slight sweetness here in the form of soft oak elements that glide easily together with the natural fruitiness and freshness of Barbera. There's nice personality and dimension and the wine is smooth and soft on the finish (save for that prickly touch of acidity you should expect).
Crisp black plum and cherry flavors are pleasant, if a tad underripe, on this full-bodied SheNAdoah Valley Cab Franc. Striking acidity and an abundance of green, herbal notes give it a lean, slightly tart midpalate.
Coming from one of the state's most esteemed vineyards, this wine offers aromas of assorted dried herbs, tobacco and glue. The cherry, herb and plum flavors have good depth, with the tannins providing some heft.
Made from Petite Sirah, Tempranillo and Tannat, this beautiy illustrates the type of blended red wine that is putting Paso Robles on the map. It's filled with cherry pie, cola and mushroom flavors that combine rich fruit with a subtle earthiness. Don't bother to age this wine, just drink it now with mushroom risotto or a rich lamb ragout.
This is so closed up at the moment, all mineral and steel, that it is hard to feel the ripeness of the tropical fruit. As this develops, it will flesh out the yellow fruits, balancing the acidity. The aftertaste is already thirst quenching.
Medium sweet, this wine has warm currant and stewed-pear flavors. It has weight to go with its sweet character. Soft and gentle, this is ready to drink.
Soft on entrance, this gains acidic steam across the palate, which drives the dialed-down flavors of berry and prune. With its modest alcohol content, this would make for a good match with a peppered roast-beef sandwich or other casual fare.
Opens with a Porty aroma, a baked brown sugar and pie-crust scent that turns dry in the mouth, with flavors of rum-soaked raisins and cocoa.
Spicy Syrah, with a clear herbal core, shows blackberry and blueberry fruit, along with lighter suggestions of compost, pepper and anise. Unfined and unfiltered, the wine remains proportionate and avoids over-the-top ripeness or heft. Best if cellared for another 5–8 years.
A distinctive personality shines through in the almost floral and lightly spicy aromas, the vivid and generous cherry-tart flavors and the ever-so-supple texture of this full-bodied wine. While it has firm acidity and tannins, this is a posh, luxurious beverage in which to indulge.
Rhubarb and tomato leaf are strongly present on the nose, followed by grassy flavors and a hollow, thin mouthfeel. Septima is Spanish-owned, and this 800-case bottling seems like a nod to the homeland. But it tastes anything but Spanish.
Edgy berry aromas include notes of pencil lead and woody oak. The crisp bouncy acidic palate emphasizes freshness over weight. Plum, currant and oak-based flavors are spicy and snappy, while this maintains a spicy character on a dry finish. Drink through 2024.
Fresh mint and mentholated cassis aromas lift the ripe black plum and berry notes on the nose of this wine. The palate is soft and lush, with a slight creaminess that harmonizes with the ripe flavors of black fruit preserves and milk chocolate. A subtle peppery kick lends a spicy character to the finish. Drink now.
The blend is 50% Merlot, 33% Cabernet Sauvignon and 17% Cabernet Franc, aged in 100% new French oak. The only wine from this producer that is a blend, it currently shows an abundance of barrel flavors. The baking spices overpower some of the signature elements that this distinguished vineyard imparts—the mineral, saline, iron and steel notes often found in Ciel's red wines. The fruit remains gorgeously ripe, and with a bit more bottle age those subtle flavors may reappear.
The nose is weak, with just slight pear and fleeting wet rocks, and the flavors aren't powerful either: apples, pears, lime pith and barely ripe peach. It's an easy-to-drink summer wine, good with a crab louie.
Notes of smoked hazelnuts mingle with scents of ripe pear and yellow flower on this dry, full-bodied wine. It's richly oaked, but bright, lemony acidity and chalky minerality add balance. It finishes on a rich note of sweet cream and butter.
Herbal blackberry and jammy black-plum aromas are forceful and brutish. This Toro has a hard, collapsed, jammy palate and overripe berry fruit flavors. A dense, chewy, baked finish is solid but lacks elegance.
Piercingly crisp, steely wine with tight acidity and the freshest of green apple and grapefruit flavors. There is a light perfume that wafts over the wine, finishing as sharp as a knife. Screwcap. Imported by Weygandt-Metzler.
Smoky ash and brimstone give this wine an elegant, mineral personality that is coupled with cherry fruit, red rose and wet earth notes. It shows a fine, silky quality, with accents of cola and black licorice. Drink after 2016.
This shows just how good Gimblett Gravels reds can be even at such a fair price point. Senior Winemaker Gordon Russell has fashioned a full-bodied, dark and dense wine that shows hints of vanilla and cedar which frame dark plum and cassis fruit, then slowly fade into a long, velvety finish. Drink 2020–2030.
Named after the winemaker's emergency flight landing on the local interstate, this is an unusual blend of Landot Noir, Chancellor, Zinfandel, Syrah and Maréchal Foch, along with bits of Pinot and Gamay Noir. It brings brings aromas and flavors of green olive, tire rubber and sea breeze with mouthwatering acidity. It doesn't all fit but still piques the interest plenty.
Made with 100% Nebbiolo, this elegant sparkler opens with aromas of orchard fruit, spring wild flower and an unusual balsamic note of eucalyptus. The dry palate delivers wild berry, peach, citrus fruit and baked bread alongside a refined persistent perlage.
Melon and white-fruit aromas are about it, but at least the nose is friendly. The palate is fluffed and easy, with soft tropical-meets-citrus flavors in front of a sweet, simple finish. Good for bargain-priced South American Chard.
This wine comes from vineyards planted in the late 1970s. It shows pleasing aromas of Bosc pear, melon and flowers. The wine tastes a hair off dry, with a full, appealing feel to the apple and passion fruit flavors.
This is fresh and herbal, with crisp flavors of red fruit and citrus. It's made from old vines close to Mont Sainte-Victoire in the heart of Provence.
Sweet, musky aromas are immediate and generous and come on the heels of mature peach, apricot and exotic fruit. This is an easy, simple wine that goes down beautifully at cocktail hour.
Full bodied, softly tannic and immediately appealing, this offering from Alain Jaume's négociant business is attractively priced. It's not the biggest or most complex Châteauneuf-du-Pape, but the ripe black-cherry and chocolate flavors and finely dusty texture are undeniably satisfying. Drink now–2018.
Whiffs of apple, pear and lemon scent this dry, delicately structured Riesling. It's brisk and sprightly on the palate, with flavorful streaks of lemon and melon that stretch out the finish, ending on a slightly savory mineral tone.
Like a Beaujolais Nouveau, this is a lively, grapey wine, with fresh-from-the-fermenter flavors of raspberries, red cherries, cinnamon and pepper.
Totally creamy notions of rose and carnation create a seductive nose. The palate joins in with ample fruit and sweetness. The residual sugar is finely balanced with lemony freshness: a very traditional, if not to say old-fashioned Gewürztraminer, but totally charming and rather delicious. Finishes medium sweet.
This forceful, tannic wine appears to be still on the upswing. Meaty scents and flavors akin to beef stew, and dark fruit notes of plum and cassis all suggest it's best served as a companion to hearty dishes. Earth, leather, coffee and bitter chocolate notes round out the medium-length finish.
David Hill's 2006 Pinot Noirs are a clear step up from earlier vintages. This Barrel Select bottling, done in a fairly light, rather delicate style, offers lovely texture and balance, with ripe flavors of strawberry, brandied cherries and baker's chocolate. Suggestions of earth and iron filings add interest and weight to the finish.
Tomato, herb, rubber and olive aromas are gritty. This Syrah fits right into the house style for this grape variety; the palate is pointed, acidic and scouring, while flavors of lemon rind, currant, graphite, herbs and pepper finish zesty, with herbal leftovers and lots of oak.
Named after a popular Afrikaner country dance, “straight arm,” this Pinotage, Touriga Nacional, Tannat, Grenache, Cabernet Sauvignon and Primitivo blend marries classic European flavors with South African spice. The nose offers blackberry, plum, cherry and pepper, and on the palate, like flavors are delivered in a structured, clean package that ends with a nutty, spicy spin.
From the north of the Margaux appellation, this is a wine that has tense, acidic, black berry fruits, soft tannins and a light, juicy character. Not for long-term aging.
As a contrast to Jonathan Maltus's Le Carré, this single-vineyard wine, from vines situated only 100 yards away, has a taut, mineral flavor, with an initial austere character which then opens out to give dark bitter chocolate and plum skin flavors. It is potentially a richer, more impressive wine, but it needs aging for 4–5 years.
Aromas of cherry, plum, forest floor and tobacco feed into a clampy palate with fresh acidity. Lightly spiced currant and red-plum flavors are limited in scope but nice, while this tastes herbal and feels tight and racy on the finish.
Mossy, earthy, lightly stewed plum and berry aromas come with accents of peppery spice and olive. In the mouth, grabby tannins attack the cheeks, while flavors of plum, tomato and prune finish with a reprise of cheek-assaulting, hard tannins. Drink through 2022.
A unique balance—9.8% alcohol and 2% residual sugar—with the subtle flavors of old vines a bonus. A gorgeous wine, tasted with escalar (white tuna) served as sushi. The buttery fish and the light, elegant Riesling are a stunning match. Neither overtakes the other.
Dusty, generic plum and berry aromas are highly regular. This Malbec is chunky in feel, without much precision. Oaky buttery slightly greasy berry flavors finish hot and creamy, with little to no elegance or cut.
Sweet and simple, with jellied apricot, peach and vanilla flavors, and a honeysuckle finish.
Dense dusty tannins dominate this 100% Touriga Nacional wine, powering its black fruits and acidity. The serious structure and firm, dry core contrast with the juicy berry flavors that will give a bright character as the wine matures. Drink from 2018.
Simple but well made, this medium-bodied, supple wine features plenty of tart cherry fruit and a crisp finish.
Fun and informal, this extremely simple sparkler offers flavors of white peach, citrus and confectionery note. It's bright and foamy, with fresh acidity.
Bouchard owns 0.54 acres of this grand cru vineyard. Rounded, ripe and soft, this has wood flavors that are an integral part of this rich, yellow-fruited wine. With spice and caramel notes to go with the fruit, it is already delicious, although it will age over 3–4 years.
Arnione, a blend of Cabernet, Merlot and Petit Verdot, packs heat and intensity and is a beautifully integrated and generous wine. Thick extraction is accented by chocolate, cherry, leather, cigar, liquid vanilla and root beer. It's tight in the mouth with bright fruit flavors. Drink after 2015.
Very tasty and fresh, this well-balanced wine combines tart citrus aromas with rich lime peel and melon flavors. Mostly fermented in tank, 15% was barrel fermented, which would account for the smoothness and roundness in texture.
An impressive effort at an attractive price, this is a full-bodied wine with an elegant edge. Floral in aroma, it luxuriates in high-toned flavors of cassis and cranberry. Soft and smooth in texture, it's graceful despite its power, and lengthy too.
Aromas of popcorn kernel, butter, petrol and oil don't work well, and despite the wine's flush, mostly balanced mouthfeel, it also doesn't deliver much in the way of flavor; the palate tastes burnt and bitter, with deadpan fruit. As fans of Viu Manent's wines, especially the winery's reds, we can dismiss this one as a swing and a miss.
Toasted oak, espresso and red berry aromas lead the nose. The palate delivers roasted coffee bean, toast and black pepper but not a lot of fruit richness. Astringent wood tannins give a mouth-drying finish.
Beautifully rich and intense, with ripe aromas of peach, apricot, grapefruit and melon. The wine is smooth and filling on the palate and the fresh acidity would match steamed asparagus with melted butter.
De Bortoli's Emeri line of sparkling wines are not conventional Pinot Noir-Chardonnay blends. This one is Pinot Grigio with bubbles, the usually muted aromas of the variety perked up to show grapefruit and fig notes. The wine is soft and fullish in body, with hints of fig coming through on the palate.
You'll find lots of ripe fig, grapefruit and melon fruit in this crisply acidic wine, and while there's a hit of vanilla and honey on the finish, it's basically dry. Nice and refreshing apéritif.
A streak of sharp acidity and green mint makes this wine too tart, despite some pleasant cherry, red currant, clove and cola flavors. The wine is unlikely to develop additional bottle complexity. Sourced from the Sanford & Benedict and La Rinconada vineyards.
This Chardonnay showcases Edna Valley's signature intensely pure varietal flavors, yet the winemaker's interventions, of oak barrel aging and sur lie influence adding complexity. It's delicious with flavors of lemon curd, pineapples, guavas, nectarines, vanilla and buttered toast.
A good Cab, dry and balanced, whose tannins are richly impressive and sweet. Shows a good tension between the oak and the ripe black currants. Easy to like, and should develop for a few years.
Blended with 7% Syrah and smaller proportions of Petit Verdot, Malbec, Cabernet Franc and other grapes, this well-made wine is restrained in style.It shows crisp red fruit, orange and cranberry loaded around dusty tannins, big oak and chocolate.
A first-rate Merlot at a good price for the quality. Dry and complex, with a soft, velvety texture, this supple wine features blackberry, red cherry, cocoa and sweet dried herb flavors, finished with toasty oak.
Bruno Mottet's 2013 purchase of Right Bank Château Seguin now delivers a ripe, smooth and soft wine. There is plenty of fruitiness, citrus, green plum and apple, all integrated into the rich texture and final acidity. Drink now.
This easy-drinking blend of Montepulciano, Merlot and Sangiovese opens with aromas of scorched earth and prune that carry over to the palate alongside flavors of raspberry and licorice. It's already reached its ideal drinking window, so enjoy soon.
This is an easy, fruity wine made from Grenache. It has a clean, bright character, reflecting its red currant fruitiness and crispness.
This is a juicy, perfect melding of citrus and light tropical fruit flavors. With impeccable balance and poise, this thrilling, entirely stainless-steel-fermented Viognier persists well onto the graceful finish.
This traditional Bordeaux-style blend offers loads of bright blackberry and cherry flavors accented by notes of dark toast, coconut and spice. Moderately concentrated on the palate, it's juicy yet firmly structured. The finish is marked by bold, dense tannins.
Fans of full-bodied, dark-fruited reds will swoon over this modern-style Garnacha from old vineyards in Aragón. Pitch black, the nose provides a pure blast of blackberry and cassis, and the palate is chewy yet fresh, with baked black-fruit flavors as well as coffee, chocolate and vanilla. A smooth, lush, layered finish with vanilla and toffee notes is the final act. Drink through 2017.
Zibibbo is usually presented as a passito dessert wine, but this is dry. The natural floral fragrance of the variety emerges on the nose, while the mouthfeel and the honey and peach flavors are detailed with acids.
Explosive ripe, luscious fruit bursts from the glass in the pungent nose and expands full throttle on the palate. The flavors, complex and layered, include honeysuckle, lime, mineral and some lovely, tropical fruit—especially mango and pineapple. Long and seamless. Editors' Choice.
Aromas of lemon juice and green apple lead to delicious ripe fruit flavors and hints of butter and vanilla on the palate. The texture is round and soft on the medium body, making it easy to enjoy now.
This is fairly sweet but not as sweet as you'd expect given its 7% residual sugar. Credit the vivid acidity built in to Washington Riesling grapes (though labeled American, the grapes are all Washington). It's got plenty of mixed fruits and as the back label suggests, it's a good choice to pair with spicy Asian foods.
Magalanne's top wine is a wood-matured blend of 40% Syrah, 30% Mourvèdre and 30% Carignan. It's nicely balanced and spry on the palate, easily moving from raspberry, cherry and citrus to leather, spice and herb before ending on some stony, dusty notes. Drink it over the next year or two.
Lightly toasty, this wraps its yellow apple fruit with citrus rind. A hint of butter cookie comes up gently as it winds down in a soft finish.
This blend of 30% Syrah, 30% Grenache, 30% Carignan and 10% Mourvèdre is not showing its true age. Sure, it boasts some developed notes of charcuterie, balsamic herb and garrigue, but it's also still brimming with full, ripe black-fruit notes of plum and berry. With a crushed velvet texture, gripping tannins and a long, heady finish that's laced with hints of espresso and vanilla, this shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon. Enjoy now, or try after 2016.
Electric acidity penetrates through this sumptuously fruity wine full of rich white-peach and grapefruit flavors. Vibrantly fresh and floral, it's sharpened by a razor's edge of minerality that lingers through the finish. It's gorgeous now for its ebullience and youth but should improve well into the 2020's.
A modern, smooth wine, with polished fruit and a dark purple color. The wine is full of new wood, but still dominated by liquorice and dark chocolate flavors. It should develop relatively quickly, over the next 10 years.
Pleasant apple, peach and melon aromas show a coastal-based saline side note. In the mouth, this Chardonnay is tight, crisp and focused by pointed acidity. Flavors of melon, papaya and salt finish tangy and fresh, something that's normal for the Aconcagua Coast.
This doesn't boast the most expressive nose but aromas of baked black plum, espresso and scorched earth slowly unfold. The warm, concentrated palate reflects the heat of the vintage, revealing blackberry jam, licorice and a hint of chewing tobacco alongside fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2020.
Cloudy in the glass, this appellation blend shows watermelon, juniper and graphite on the nose, accenting its forward primary fruit aromas. There's an energetic tang to the sip, with a full-bodied mouthfeel and cranberry and anise flavors.
Clarissa Nagy, whose main job is making wine for Riverbench, sources grapes from the nearby Garey Ranch Vineyard for this bottling. It shows strawberry, plum blossom, beet juice, rose petals and cola on the nose. The palate is light and easy, with flavors of pencil lead, Earl Grey tea and brisk cranberry juice.
Dramatically dark, staining the glass with glycerine streaks, this wine  unabashedly celebrates its hot country origins. Considerable tannins  frame a core of berry fruit, with a zingy, peppery note that stimulates  the taste buds, but acidity is soft. At the same time, it retains a  rustic character typical of the varietal.
A pungent blend of Sierra Foothills-grown Syrah, Primitivo, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, Sierra Legend starts off earthy—as well as like a liquid form of stewed plums—before taking on leather and coffee components. Smoothly textured, it's a straight shooter, ready for rich, earthy food.
From the producer's dry-farmed mountain vineyard, this wine is crafted from vines planted some 40 years ago. Peach, fig and pear wrap around this medium-weight wine's integrated oak and gravelly texture. The acidity is bright, uplifting and lush enough to find complete balance.
Young and tight, this new release shows excellent aging potential. The fruit is compact and complex, a lush mix of pomegranate, raspberry and cherry, spiced gracefully with sweet baking spices. There is a delicate herbal note as well, and the overall balance is superb.
Here's an Italian sparkling rosé with a peachy-pink color and a wide aromatic offering that includes hints of clove, peach, melon and toasted nut. The wine is smooth and slightly soft although those piquant bubbles give it a sharper edge.
Crisp and clean, with aromas and flavors that blend nectarine and grapefruit. Shows ample weight on the palate, yet finishes tart and refreshing.
Aromas of blueberry and raspberry are floral and exotic, which is usual for Cafayate wines. This has a chunky, grapy mouthfeel and fruit-cake flavors of stewed berry and plum along with spice notes. A jammy feeling finish is low on structure.
Too much acidity on this Syrah and Mourvedre blend feels like a knife through the palate. But the cherry, cola and spice flavors are good, and the wine is fully dry and moderate in alcohol.
Crushed blackberry and smoky blueberry show a vibrant presence. This is luscious and velvety, without ever losing its continental-climate freshness and poise. Really refreshing and uncomplicated, but definitely not simple, this provides exciting fruit and is easy to drink on its own.
A blend of 8 prime vineyards scattered across the appellation, this is a delicately light, but savory, Pinot Noir, the kind that supports food rather than overshadowing it. The cherry, tea, cola, herb and subtle oak flavors are restrained, leading to a dry, balanced finish.
A Chateauneuf-du-Pape inspired blend of 64% Grenache, 24% Mourvèdre and 12% Syrah, Moriah was not made in 2011 but roars back to life in 2012 light ruby red in color and fully refined in rose petal aromatics. Integrated and subtle, it's focused in bright red fruit and layered white pepper.
A new world style Cabernet Sauvignon with deeply tasted notes of coffee, nut, vanilla and moderate cherry and blackberry fruit. The power is there suggesting a pairing possibility with grilled meat, although the tannins are soft thus broadening its appeal to hearty pasta dishes too.
Inky in color, this wine has plump aromas of ripe fruit, blackberry jam and rum cake. On the palate, it is soft and smooth.
Potent and dark, with a syrupy nose of mint, blackberry and cream. The palate feel is more choppy than ideal, while the flavors run towards cola, root beer, pepper and baked black fruits. Coconut appears on the finish along with pepper; Malbec, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon comprise this Bordeaux blend.
This opens with earthy, smoky aromas of coffee grinds and blackberry along with toasted marshmallow. The palate is thick and mouthfilling, with baked berry, spice and chocolate flavors. The finish is minty and herbal, with moderate heat and burn.
Saucy berry and tea aromas are herbal, earthy and stewed. This feels full but syrupy. Flavors of cooked berry, molasses and mocha finish sweet and soupy, with only a touch of acidic offset.
Offers a mishmash of aromas that include plenty of woody notes like vanilla and toast as well as cherry fruit. The result in the mouth comes across as slightly medicinal, with cherry and menthol flavors that turn tangy on the finish. Imported by Walca International.
Refreshingly dry Champagne. With its tight strawberry flavors, it is forward and fruity. It has a fine burst of lime acidity to complement the red fruits. Not for aging, delicious now.
Once again, the Syrah from the Rocky Mother Vineyard proves its mettle, with a young, juicy, jammy, joyful expression of pure berry flavor. Compelling structure, amazing purity and a well-modulated hint of chocolate from aging in 20% new French oak complete the picture.
A warm, uncomplicated wine. The nose delivers oak and aromas of balsamic dressing, pencil shavings and chunky blackberry. Chunky is also the best way to describe the palate, which emphasizes blackberry, cherry and plum. Size is both the wine's virtue and bane, and in the final count the 2005 Alcance Carmenère seemed better balanced.
This is a stunning wine at this price, sourced mainly from Sonoma County-based vineyards, with another 19% of the grapes from Lake County and 16% from Napa. It includes other Bordeaux red varieties in the mix, as well as tiny amounts of Syrah and Petite Sirah. Medium bodied and dusty in tannin, with dried herb tones, it's structured, velvety and finishes on a dark chocolate note.
A bit of a disappointment from this famed vineyard. The wine is uneven, with sweetly candied cherry flavors alongside unripe vegetal notes.
This wine from a single 25-acre vineyard in the appellation is lushly spicy in red currant, plum and clove, with seasonings of black pepper. Lively in the glass with balanced acidity and sumptuous weight and texture, it's lovely, focused and bold.
Aromas of tropical fruit, yellow apple and fragrant wild flower lead into a straightforward palate offering dried apricot, citrus, bitter almond and a confectionery note. Fresh acidity brightens the finish.
Different from the crowd. The nose concedes light raspberry and cranberry aromas, while the palate is a pink passion play that's not that easy to figure out. It's tangy, with citrus and berry mixing in an unconventional manner. Interesting in the mouth; a quality wine. Not run of the mill. Imported by De Maison Selections, Inc.
Held back for more than four years, this Cab remains tough in tannins and lush in primary fruits. It's as ripe as any '09 out there, with black cherry, currant, chocolate and roasted coconut flavors. A succulent sweetness runs throughout, despite the absolutely dry finish. Hold until 2018, and if you have more than one bottle, drink one every additional year.
Ripe berry, tilled earth, violet, grilled herb and coffee aromas lead the nose on this firmly structured wine. The palate delivers black cherry, crushed raspberry, chocolate, anisette and black pepper. It's supported by a backbone of bracing, astringent tannins.
One of the strangest-smelling wines we've encountered from Spain: there's forced cinnamon, heavy funk, dampness and other unfamiliar, foreign scents. The palate has weight and a gritty feeel, while the core flavors are Sherried. Hard to see the appeal here.
Blackberry and prune aromas show herbal notes and a hint of dried leaf. Medium-full in size and friendly in feel, this has moderate acidity that lends freshness. Gritty, peppery black-fruit flavors finish with an echo of licorice and dark spice. Drink through 2021.
Ripe and easy to drink, this Cab is fully ready now. It shows a wealth of blackberry, cherry, currant, licorice, chocolate mint and vanilla flavors, wrapped into sweet, smooth tannins.
With crisp acidity and a delicacy in the mouth, this Pinot has pleasant raspberry, cherry and oak flavors, and is ready to drink now.
This soft Zin bursts with blackberry and cherry fruit. Grippy, it's savory in coffee and leather with a slight astringency to the finish. It tends to be among Sobon's better bottlings every year.
Shocks of ripe rich yellow peach and pineapple revitalize the palate of this animated off-dry Riesling. Simultaneously bracing and sun-drenched, it's a straightforward yet delectably juicy treat. Enjoy now while young.
Touched by the ocean breezes, this vineyard has long ripening, cool-climate characteristics. And this blend of Castelão, Camarate, Tinta Miúda and Touriga Nacional is elegant, with soft, velvet tannins balancing well with the plum skin and the refreshing acidity. It all holds together very well.
Tight in acidity and tannins now, but very complex, offering a range of cherry, tangerine zest, mushroom, cola and Indian spice flavors that swirl to a long finish. The mouthfeel is delicate, but the power is impressive. Drink now–2015.
The price on this high-flying Rioja continues to go through the roof, and so does the oak and tannin. And while we still appreciate the wine's intensity and power, this vintage pushes so much espresso, burnt nut and rubber that it probably won't impress all comers. In the mouth, look for dark, almost bitter black-fruit flavors followed by a firm, tannic finish. Needs time in the cellar to find more integration. Hold for another year before checking on its status.
This blend is principally Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot with a pinch of Petit Verdot blended in. The barrel aromas (24 months in all-new French) stand out at first, with notes of chocolate, coffee and spice. The black-fruit flavors are full bodied and high-octane, showing some warmth on the finish. The oak needs more time to integrate.
This 100% Viognier was grown in the Bien Nacido Vineyard. It's bone dry, crisp in acidity and firm in wet stone minerals, while the rich fruit flavors suggest fresh, juicy citron, quince and sweet lime. Just wonderful, a bracing, pure, clean and pure example of a variety that can often be fussy.
The full force of aromatic, dried pear rises from the glass, laced with dried apricot and candied peel. The pear fruit becomes exquisitely clear and pure on the palate, which is profound but slender. The wine is dry but powerful, holding at its core all the ripeness and fruit flavor from brilliant sunlight. It almost warms you from inside and goes on and on. Drink now till 2030.
Blueberry studded with white pepper meets gamy cured meat on the nose. The flavors are cracked pepper-driven bringing dark berries with a sanguine edge to a medium-to-full bodied palate. Textured tannins are held at bay by balanced acidity and carry to a dried meat finish.
Scents of black currant, green bell pepper, cedar and a hint of violet slowly emerge in the glass. The firm palate offers dried black cherry, toast, coffee, mocha and a touch of vanilla alongside polished, fine-grained tannins.
In this soft, easy style of rosé, red fruits mingle with a caramel and spice backdrop. Refreshing acidity cuts through the ripe fruitiness, giving a rounded wine that works both as an apéritif and with food.
Quite dark and dense, generous and ripe, this Grenache offers a mix of red and black fruits. The flavors continue onto a finish that's rich with kirsch and coffee.
Cabernet Franc makes up half this wine, with the balance Cabernet Sauvignon (33%) and Merlot. Plum, blueberry, blackberry and baking-spice aromas lead to a fruit-filled palate with light barrel accents throughout.
Dark in appearance, with reduced, grapy, inky aromas, this compact Carmenère nearly collapses under its own weight. Heavily toasted blackberry flavors finish stout, with blackened spice notes. If there's a knock on this blockbuster, it's that it lacks layering and elegance.
White-fruit aromas are tropical, with warmth and weight. A round, raring-to-go palate brings loads of peach, citrus and spice flavors, while the finish is loud, with tons of sweet, ripe fruit rambling out the door.
Meaning “from the vine,” this 100% whole-cluster bottling presents black cherry, tart pomegranate, graphite, baking spice and sage bark on the nose. There's lots of dark herbs and dark fruit on the palate as well as black-olive depth and black-slate minerality. With the density of herbs, it's a bit like chewing on sage and eucalyptus.
Not the greatest Beringer PR of late, this wine showcases the weakness of the vintage. It's earthy and tannic, with only a suggestion of cherries and blackberries. It's a wine to drink now and over the next few years.
Perfumed, bold and brambly, this is a full-bodied and fairly-priced rendition of the variety that's big in cherry cola flavor, earthy mint and oak.
Extremely high alcohol, well over 16%, gives this wine a hot, peppery mouthfeel, and makes it quite heady, as well. It tastes rich in Port-like currants, licorice and chocolate. Syrah, Cab, Merlot.

Ripe and rich, this irresistibly fruity spätlese is concentrated with peach marmalade, guava and grapefruit flavors, but braced by a streak of lemon-lime acidity and a delicate spritz that tickles the palate. Satisfying and juicy, it finishes long with a hint of grapefruit-pith astringency.
Honey-sweet flavors of raspberries, pink grapefruits and guavas, along with hints of vanilla and yeast mark this salmon-colored blush. Try with sushi, smoked salmon, mushroom risotto.
The high score reflects the wine's potential, because it has been put on the market before it's ready to be opened. Fresh and zippy in acidity, its flavors are of raspberry and cherry pie filling, while sweet, caramelized oak has not yet been integrated. Cellar it for a year or two, even longer. It should be quite a beautiful wine by the end of 2012.
Crisp and refreshing with notes of grated ginger, white flowers and cantaloupe. This dry Riesling balances peachy fruit flavors with a steely backbone of slate and lime, tart acidity and a pleasantly long finish. Lovely all around.

This austere and lightly herbal Cabernet is balanced and varietal, but at first seems a bit dull, as if tasted through a screen. That said, it actually improved after 24 hours, with more presence to the tart red and black fruits. It's an elegant style that will probably show best with food.
This shows the Diamond Creek signature of dryness, mountain tannins and voluptuously ripe, concentrated fruit. It's dense in blackberry jam and cassis flavors, with firm minerality and a lush toast note from the oak. Near perfection in all of its parts, it possesses those hard-to-define qualities of balance and elegance. Wonderful as it is now, the tannins suggest aging it for many years.

D'Arenberg's Coppermine Cabernets are often tannic and austere upon release, so be warned should you decide to open one in the next year or two. The aromas and flavors are classic this year, seamlessly marrying cassis and cedar, but finishing dry, astringent and firm. Drink 2020–2030+.
Horsey, overripe aromas don't convey a sense of balance. As the nose indicates, this comes across heavy and syrupy, with blocky tannins. Stewy flavors of blackberry and prune finish with hard tannins.
This is a 100% varietal wine grown entirely on the producer's estate. Aged nearly two years in all-new French Nevers oak, it shows a tinge of smoke—campfire nearly—from the barrel, followed by a reduced expression of blueberry and herbes de Provence. Firm, integrated tannins don't distract.

This is the first Syrah from Otis Kenyon, made by consulting winemaker Dave Stephenson from Cougar Hills grapes. It is lifted and spicy, with clean and racy flavors of cranberry, raspberry and wild cherry. The lively acids bring in suggestions of grapefruit and citrus as well.
Fermented and aged in tank, the wine is nothing but simply attractive pure ripe fruit. It has density and concentration that come from the generous apple and yellow-fruit flavors. At the same time, the wine is cut by delicious acidity and minerality. Drink this wine from 2018.

Aromas suggest mature berry, scorched earth, animal, toast and anise. The palate offers ripe black berry, oak, espresso, cocoa and vanilla alongside dusty tannins.

Made by Kirk Venge from a Dutton Ranch vineyard site, this wine immediately offers a lot to like, from its earthy sassafras and compelling layers of crisp raspberry and cherry, to its soft layers of oaky density accented in rose. Requiring more time to open, with an ideal cellaring through 2023, it finishes with a flair of cedar and vanilla, lasting long on the palate.
The vineyard is in the chilly Petaluma Gap, and you can taste the foggy influence in the brisk acidity and pebbly minerality that accompany ripe apricot, lemon, lime and orange flavors. Plenty of oak, too, which adds buttered toast and vanilla richness. It's a good Chardonnay for drinking now.
A good, rich, savory Merlot, although it's a little excessive in ripeness, offering sweet cherry jam and milk chocolate flavors. Tasty, but too expensive for what you get.

A limited- production wine (185 cases), it captures the quintessence of central Napa Valley Cabernet, and even in this less than successful vintage, testifies to the great terroir. It's plush, elegant, harmonious, delicate, powerful, graceful and frankly delicious.

Hints of warm spice, pine and dried herbs add dimension to notes of sweet cherry preserves on the nose and palate of this light-bodied Pinot Noir. Ripe red plums and violet notes brighten the midpalate.

Exotic spice, toast, espresso and mature black-skinned fruit aromas lead the nose. The palate is rather austere, showing dried berry, spearmint, ground pepper and wild herb alongside aggressive tannins that clench the finish. Give the tannins a few more years to soften then drink up.
Drinks hot and thick in tannins, and despite some pretty cherry, cured leather, blackberry and coffee flavors, there's a rusticity the wine can't quite overcome. But it'll be fine with barbecue.
This release comes from the producer's own Durell Vineyard, specifically two blocks consistently used for this wine.

The dark, black fruit on the nose and palate of Ray Len's Carolinus red blend is ripe, but a bit tired and dusty, competing for attention with all the dark, toasted oak. It's a straightforward Carolina red with a hint of tomato leaf and not a lot of structure, but fine for everyday fare.
The inviting nose of this mature red blends berry, vanillin oak, sweet cream, wood and tobacco.

Probably would have shown more positively three years ago. —M.M.

This wine will dazzle fans of oak, but true enthusiasts should draw the line and signal the winery that oak is a seasoning, not the main ingredient.
The wine comes from vines planted on a small island off the Provence coast. Its cool seaside climate has given a crisp red-currant flavored wine. Light and bright with lively acidity, the wine is textured with taut minerality. Drink now.
Owned by the Wine Museum of Paris, this estate has 172-acres of vines. This wine is rich, spicy and with mature tannins and red fruits. It is all fruit, ripe and ready to drink.
This Cabernet Franc—with 10% Petit  Verdot—has easygoing black-cherry and raspberry notes, plus mocha and turmeric subtleties. It has light, pliant tannins, while the medium to high amount of acids keep the palate feeling energetic.
Harder and more oily on the nose than desired, with white-fruit aromas that turn sharp. The palate has ample wetness and acidity, but the flavors are somewhat bitter, nutty and oily. It's also mildly bitter on the finish. Something's not quite right here, yet it doesn't seem flawed.
Aromas of blue flower and black berries lead the nose in this blend of 90% Sangiovese and 10% Merlot/Alicante. The straightforward, linear palate shows black cherry and espresso alongside drying tannins.
Round and rich, this has delicious acidity and touches of tropical fruits. It's ripe and full bodied, with an attractive hint of wood.
This five grape southern Rhône-style blend shows sour cherry fruit, set in an earthy frame. Simple and rugged, it's suitable for every day drinking.
Here's a decidedly uncomplicated expression of Dolcetto from vintner Paolo Veglio that plays its fruit and spice cards very well. You'll get tones of blueberry, plum and wild berry, with a touch of cinnamon and clove at the end. The tannic structure is firm enough to contend with creamy cheese.
This simple, direct Cabernet appeals for its blackberry, licorice and sweet mocha flavors. It's a soft wine for drinking with everyday fare.
Blackberry syrup, vanilla, mocha and a flash of mint are cut by a rocky edge on the nose of this blend of 58% Tempranillo, 21% Grenache and 21% Malbec. Extremely soft and welcoming tannins meet with solid acidity on the palate, where rich black fruit, hoisin sauce and Chinese five-spice flavors arise.
Made by winemaker Georgetta Dane, this white is awash in kumquat and vanilla, the medium-bodied layers of texture soft and round and accessible to a broad range of palates.
A lovely, crisp, light wine that's not really dry, but nearly so. Has finely detailed citrus and wildflower aromas and flavors, and good acidity.
Generous in style, with great freshness. The flavors are rich, touched by caramel, ripe white currants and some spice. A fine, red apple skin structure comes through to finish.
Very dry and a little austere, with suggestions of cherry skins, citrus fruits and spices. The alcohol is nice and low, while the acidity is brisk. A fine, elegant rosé, delicate and easy to drink.
Bold swathes of bramble, toast and smoke reverberate throughout this inky rich red. While lusciously concentrated, it's not at all brawny with tart red-currant acidity and fine-grained tannins lending a four-square frame of structure. The finish is penetrating and quite long.
Ripe notes of yellow plum dance on the palate against a firm, citric background of immense freshness. This stands with poise and a seriously straight back. The midpalate is as savoury as soy sauce. Totally enlivening and refreshing with a lovely, concentrated core and backbone.
This Bordeaux-style blend includes all five grapes. It's light and seamless, with a peppery, herbal streak running under compact, tannic dark fruit.
Soft tannins and a rounded texture make this wine almost drinkable now. The smooth structure only slowly shows tannins and acidity. A fresh, raspberry fruit character will allow the wine to develop. Drink now, although better from 2017.
From the Napa side of Carneros comes this dry, full-bodied Pinot Noir. From the dark color to the rich black cherry and currant flavors, it's Grenache-like, and fully ready now. A tasty wine to drink with a good steak.
Clean and vibrant, with apricot, fig and vanilla flavors, this single-vineyard dessert wine has refreshing acidity. It's sweet, but not too sweet, and look at that nice, low alcohol, only 9%.
Spicy blackberry and vanilla starts this savory, rich Syrah from Glen Carlou. On the palate, lush blackberry is laced with meaty, balsamic and smoke flavors. Rich and mouthfilling, with a touch of lively spice.
Fresh, forward and fruity, this brings light strawberry fruit and streaks of root beer. It's tasty and quaffable, though done in a lighter style.
The aromas of melon and tropical fruit are light but enchanting. The medium-bodied flavors provide interest and show a pleasing sense of balance.
I loved the '03. This one's right up there. The grapes give opulent flavors of tropical fruits, wildflowers, minerals, spices and honey, while partial barrel fermentation and new oak aging add a Burgundian creamy richness. The winery is at the top of the Viognier game in California.
This Ripasso opens with a solid, direct approach spearheaded by plump aromas of cherry, chocolate and a touch of root beer. In the mouth, it shows medium structure with a clean, polished close.
Ridge's historic Monte Bello estate produces black tobacco, wet slate, chalk and blueberry jam aromas in this vintage. The wine, which gets support from 14% Merlot-3% Petite Verdot-1% Cabernet Franc, is not very dense and even racy on the palate, with violet, cola, tart cranberry and darker fruit as well.
Foamy, fresh and rather soft, this mouthfilling wine smells subtly like raspberries and cherries. It tastes attractively fruity and has a smooth texture.
The Edna Valley-based Talley family heads north for this blend of 46% Cabernet Sauvignon, 24% Petit Verdot, 23% Malbec and 7% Merlot. It shows plump blueberries, blackberry jam, cream soda and black cherry syrup, as well as smoke and graphite on the nose. The palate starts with juicy cola and red currant then evolves toward snapped dark chocolate and cedar.
This lovely Sauvignon Blanc is a little sweet in honey. But the acidity is crisp, and there's a fine mineral undertow to the fresh peach, citrus and green apple flavors, so the finish feels dry and clean.
Here's a modern, fruit-forward Valpolicella Superiore with plump red cherry and integrated nut tones that translate into vanilla, spice and tobacco. The wine is richly concentrated and has syrupy red fruit flavors on the close with slightly astringent tannins. Imported by George Wine Selection.
An oily popcorn aroma is neither fresh nor lively. The palate is wide and mouthfilling, with notes of bitter almond and creamy citrus. It's viscous on the finish, but there's not much flavor or character.
Freshly cut peel of tart but ripe red apple entices on the nose. The palate embraces all this with the subtle, creamy richness of autolysis: Think shortcake and soft sponge. A luminous core of fresh, brisk acidity brightens everything, lifting up flavors of red apple, strawberry and tart red currant on the palate. This harmonious rosé leaves a lasting impression and is appetizing with its lightning streak of freshness.
From one of the Nelson region's pioneering winemakers, this is as good a wine as I can remember the Seifried family producing. The combination of subtle snow-pea and bold passion-fruit flavors is spot on, and the wine's ample weight, slightly creamy texture and long, grapefruity finish work together to create a harmonious whole.
Lush in dark fruit, notably blueberry and blackberry, this is a soft, mellow, concentrated Syrah with a hint of forest floor and white pepper. With 4% Viognier blended in, it's long on the finish, with acidity able to support years of aging.
The 8.3 designation refers to the residual sugar by weight. It is indeed a very sweet wine, rich in simple honey, orange and apricot flavors.
With rich pear and apricot flavors, this is a blend of old-vine Ugni Blanc and Rolle. Ripe and full bodied, it is pointed up with spice that balances the fresh fruitiness. The wine, tangy and with a warm aftertaste, is ready to drink.
Leafy, spicy red-berry aromas suggest asphalt. This is pleasant on the palate, with rubbery tannins. Flavors of rose water, raspberry and plum are light and floral, while the finish is easygoing.
This is a gorgeously light coastal offering, a subdued expression of the variety that unravels its layers slowly and methodically. Red cherry, lavender and blueberry are revealed on the palate as perfumed shocks of rose and salty air permeate the nose. Vibrantly crisp, it has a slight grip to the velvety texture.
Clean, correct and enjoyable; this Riesling is well balanced, with a dry feel and citrus, olive oil and floral components through and through. At first blush, it smells a little like Viognier—a testament, maybe, to the winery's renown with that variety?
89-91 Barrel sample. This is ripe, smoothly textured, with bright fruits, the tannins structured, but letting the fruit speak.
Quite ripe and dark, with blackberry, raisin and aromas of woody spice manifested as cinnamon. The palate shows a controlled sharpness and then flavors of saturated berry fruit accented by oak-based notes of vanilla and dill weed. A powerful, deep style of crianza with a lot of oak.
This traditional-method Riesling sekt, made from a collection of Bernkastel vineyard sites, has been a consistent crowd pleaser from vintage to vintage. It's a cutting, spry wine with delicate, persistent bubbles and concentrated green apple, lemon and lime flavors. Brut in style, with revitalizing acidity and complexities of caramelized sugar and nuts, it makes an ideal apéritif.
Superintense and fine, this elegant Brunello delivers its aromas in an immediate and determined manner. There's cola, root beer, cassis, spice and pressed violet and the mouthfeel is crisp and well structured.
This producer has a well-deserved reputation for preserving rare vines varieties. In this case, the Petit Courbu and the even rarer Arrufiac are blended with the more familiar Gros Manseng. It is a dry wine although the perfumed acidity and the crisp clean pear and apricot flavors give it a soft, ripe character. Drink the wine now.
The winery has focused on Cab Franc, with mixed results, as the variety is tough to master. This bottling is very dry and astringently tannic, but it has a rich core of cherry fruit. Such is the balance that it might soften and sweeten after 2008.
This is a structured wine whose fruit is still coming through the tannins. It has a dry core, layers of acidity and juicy bitter cherry acidity. Drink from the end of 2016.
A closed nose leads straight to a vanilla-tinged palate of strawberry enveloped by mellow, soft notes of oak. This is rounded and pliable, cushioned with echoes of baking spice and comfort. The palate is soft and silky. Everything about this wine is soothing and mellow.
Savory on the nose and palate, with a slightly dusty apple note that lingers amidst whiffs of vanilla, spice, potpourri and sweet cream. Big in body and alcohol.
Dark, rich and dramatically structured, with ultra-refined black and red currant, cherry, violet, cedar and smoke flavors that are grounded by a firm minerality. It's a Bordeaux blend based on Cabernet Franc.
This well saturated rosé opens with a dark pink, almost ruby color and offers aromas of red fruit and forest berry that are not particularly intense. The neutral nose suits the wine fine because it makes up for it with a thick, smooth mouthfeel and ripe berry flavors.
A nice effort at this price, with mixed dried herb, sweet cracker and sour plum flavors. There's enough bracing acid to give it body, and enough weight to the tart fruit to lift it well above the soda-pop style of most of its peers.
Smoky char takes on a grilled meatiness in this wine, a fatness of bacon and blackberry jam emphasizing the intense ripeness and grip of it all. Blackberry jam and vanilla sweetness underscore its big personality.
The old-vine name is French, as are the estate owners, and the wine itself is pretty good despite being a bit thick, chewy and aimless. The nose is full but nondescript, while apple and oak-driven flavors define the palate. The finish is textured and woody. Mouthfeel is its primary attribute while interesting or unusual tastes prove elusive.
Young and very much still developing, Sentinel Oak is Terre Rouge's single-vineyard Syrah, a spicy, smoky concoction of great depth, intensity and beauty, concentrated and eager to mature. This wine has a pronounced meaty quality to it, and will pair accordingly, particularly with smoked meat, which will accentuate its own smoky allure.
This is one of the higher elevation premier crus in Puligny. In this warm vintage it has managed to give a wine that is crisp and mineral. To contrast with this, the wine also has a creamy, toasty character from the wood aging. Drink from 2021.
Gritty, heavily roasted aromas of stewed berry, coffee grinds and compost are less than appealing, although with airing things improve. This is wide and blocky in the mouth, with ripe, raisiny, roasted black-fruit flavors matched by bitter espresso. Molasses and heat drive the finish on this pricey wine that's not in great shape.
Almost luscious pear aromas and notes of peardrop make for a very fruity nose. The palate has a fruity, lemony ease, while the body is slender, dry and has some spritz. The lemon freshness is vivid, brightening everything on this easy, fruity summer wine.
From a handful of vineyards, this wine showcases good blending skills in its ability to offer crisp grapefruit, apricot and green apple atop a creamy texture and neutral oak structure. It's light, bright and ready for the table.
Funky smelling and unfamiliar, with sweet, candied spice notes and strange candied cherry aromas. Vibrant and bouncy in terms of feel, but follows the nose by tasting sweet and weird. Weak on the finish as well.
A good, dry Zinfandel, although it's a little overripe in prunes. Not too much, though, so don't be alarmed. It's very spicy, suggesting drinking with equally spicy foods, like spice-rubbed beef, pork and chicken, grilled to perfection. Nice restaurant wine due to its elegance.
Dense in color, with earthy, crusty aromas of baked berry, moss, tobacco, cola and cassis. Feels lush, meaty and deep, with tobacco, balsamic flavors, baked blackberry and chocolate. Mellow, lightly herbal and smooth on the finish; hits all the high marks. Drink now.
This is a ripe wine that accurately reflects the heat of the 2003 summer. Apple, peach and honey aromas and flavors and a big, slightly oily mouthfeel overwhelm any mineral elements--at least now, in its boisterous, fun youth.
Herbal aromas bring a whiff of compost and leather. A wiry, dilute palate shows green tannins, while flavors of buttery, almost greasy oak and cranberry finish weedy and weakly.
The wine is almost mature. It has a minty edge with some firm tannins and plenty of balanced fruit and acidity. It benefits from the propitious conditions in this appellation during the difficult 2013 vintage and shows ripe fruit and a generous berry aftertaste. Drink from 2019.
This is nice and hints at greater things, but ultimately it's more modest and fluffy than substantive. Aromas of oak resin, baked apple and vanilla introduce a palate with mild acidity and not much structure. Vanilla, caramel, banana and honey- dew flavors finish soft.
Gooseberry and lychee candy pervade over subtle notes of lemon, lime and eucalyptus. Vibrant on the palate, lychee and gooseberry remain the stars but take on a bitterness. Racy acidity is prevalent and lends itself to a tart finish.
This Roederer-owned property has produced an impressive wine this vintage. Full, plump and rich, and packed with firm black fruits which are layered with fine, pure acidity. This is a wine that is likely to age, over 5–10 years. Imported by Maisons Marques & Domaines USA.
Tasty and full-bodied, this is a wine you might mistake for a Chateauneuf, with its plummy, blackberry and spice flavors. Heavy for a Pinot, with thick but manageable tannins, but still a good, rich wine.
Ripe, full-bodied wine, the fresh white currant and pear fruits layered with wood. The wine is bright with good concentration. Screwcap.
Earthy, gritty, animal aromas are a bit raw as they blend with currant and red-plum scents. This wine lacks depth on the palate and flavors of tomato, red plum, herbs and oak finish choppy, drawing and tannic.
An attractive array of cedar, cinnamon, red cherry and black currant aromas and flavors fill this medium-bodied wine to the rim. The acidity, tannins and flavors are all well proportioned and balance each other out in a sophisticated way. The result is an elegant but firm wine that will be appetizing at the table now through 2020.
Highly enticing, handsome aromas of graphite, blueberry, boysenberry and oaky grit are firm and minerally. This lush, modern, stately Tempranillo is pure, plump and deep on the palate. Flavors of blackberry, cassis and fine oak come together like paint on Dalí's canvas, while the finish is loamy and complex, with flavors of tobacco folded into silky smooth depth. Drink through 2024
Here is a freshly aromatic and vibrant Barbera d'Asti that offers elements of red berry, chopped herbs and white stone backed by spice and hazelnut. The wine is crisp and brightens up the mouth with its red berry flavors.
Concentrated and ripe, yet still muscular and rigid, this Bordeaux-style blend was made to age. On the palate, touches of earth, tobacco and balsamic vinegar lend a savory tone to lip-smacking black cherries and plums. Dense, deep tannins mark the finish, but should yield and meld with time. Hold till at least 2018. It should continue to reward cellaring for another decade.
Fairly full on the bouquet, with a dense roundness that cups charcoal and shoe polish aromas along with berry fruit. A bit more harsh than desirable on the palate, with sweetness lacking. That said, it pours on the plum, cherry and cranberry in fist-like fashion.
Although this Cab is a little light in body, it's clean and bone dry and enormously food-friendly. Shows pretty flavors of currants, blackberries and herbs, with smooth tannins.
Plum aromas are pounded home with notes of meat and menthol. When you next hear the word “opaque,” think of this. But the body is surprisingly svelte, and the flavors emphasize red fruit. Some tannins are manifested on the finish, which shows licorice and buttery oak.
Sensations of mature black plum are layered with notes of chocolate and roasted coffee bean. It's ripe, dense and evolved, with a markedly sweet finish. Drink now.
One of Cuvaison's best basic Pinots in years, this is charming with its dry, crisp structure, silky elegance and fine flavors of raspberries, cherries and toasty oak. While not an ager, it's a beautiful wine to pair with tuna, salmon, lamb or steak.
The Clos wine from Jean-Luc Baldès reveals juicy black fruits with plenty of young acidity. A firmly structured character powers through the fruits and gives density under the smoother surface. The wine is obviously still young, reveling in its youthful fruits. Drink from 2016.
Perfumed peach is edged with citrus, yeast and a hint of pepper on a very enticing nose. The palate tinges the fruit with far more savoriness: the full force of yeasty spice, something herbal and salty and incredibly moreish. Citrus also provides a wonderfully high-toned dimension that suggests pink grapefruit zest and kumquats. This is toned, concentrated and full of verve.
A little coarse and rugged on the nose, there's a meaty and earthy cedar streak to the otherwise black plum and berry fruit core of this Merlot. The concentrated fruit carries through to the medium-weight mouth, with a softly chewy texture of dusty tannins and powdery mocha flavors.
Soft and attractively spicy, this has flavors of fresh apple, exotic mango and kiwi. Along with this fruitiness is a perfumed character that rounds out the finish. Screwcap.
Firm wine, with tannins to match the chunky structure. Black currant fruits go with acidity, green pepper and spice. It's a delicious wine from an almost unknown appellation in the central mountains of France.
Here's a hefty, big expression of Nebbiolo with thick spice notes and touches of vanilla and cinnamon that sit over a core of bright fruit. The wine offers a soft quality of tannin, followed by tart freshness, resulting in a pleasurable sensation of richness and opulence on the palate. Drink now until 2018.
Carpineto offers a uniquely floral Chianti Classico (90/10 Sangiovese and Canaiolo) with aromas that recall violets, lavender and sweet jasmine. You'll also get cherry cough drop or cinnamon spice smoothed over the wine's lean texture and no-fuss appeal.
This pure varietal bottling is compact and tannic. Blue and black fruits lean toward deep cassis flavors, with earth, pencil lead and peppery herb along for the ride. Chewy tannins and herbal flavors come up in the finish.
An easy-drinking Coonwarra Cab, with regionally characteristic notes of cassis, cedar and mint. It's medium in weight, with a finish that turns tart and tea-like. Drink now–2017.
Voluptuous and sensual, this is an exotically ripe style of Merlot that joins lush fruit and toasty oak with a fine tannin-acid structure. They used to call Merlot the soft Cabernet, and in this case it really is true. At its best now.
This wine is fragrant and ripe while having a balanced, delicate structure. It offers plenty of fruit and acidity, with dusty tannins and sweet berry flavors. It should develop well and quickly. Drink from 2019.
This is a 100% varietal wine, age-worthy and decadent, a hedonistic display of raspberry and chocolate with just the barest hint of clove and pepper. Soft, velvety tannins give it additional lushness and pleasurability. It's enjoyable now, but should hold well through 2022.
This is a big, black  wine, intensely medicinal and herbal in character. It has powerful, extracted, dark tannins, emphasized by chocolate and spice flavors, as well as dark plums.
Char and chocolate, then a dollop of rum raisin and black cherry, and there is your nose. This version of Cirsion, one of our very favorite modern Riojas, is relatively soft, raisiny and simple, and for that it doesn't quite rate with some of the past vintages, which were spectacular. But that doesn't mean you won't love the wine's smooth texture, cocoa and baked berry flavors, and its overall generous character. Drink now through 2010.
This has aromas of Bartlett pear and black Mission figs. In the mouth, there are flavors of pear, lemon and fresh picked apricots.
Although the color is an evolved garnet with brick edges, this wine offers a fresh nose of blue flower, gingerbread and ripe cherry with hints of toast and clove. The palate is evolved but still delivers ripe red cherry, vanilla and espresso along with smoothed tannins and soft acidity. Not much complexity and even though it's forward, it's also balanced. Drink through 2019.
Cocoa, herb, raspberry, vanilla and spice aromas are out front on this wine. The blue and red fruit and barrel flavors are creamy in feel and carry through the finish.
This takes ripe fruit and oak influence to the limits, with powerful flavors of buttered toast, pineapple, orange jam and vanilla-cream. This defines the flashy style of California Chardonnay, with a honeyed finish.
Hints of smoke and crushed slate lend minerality to this bracingly dry Riesling from Treleaven. Lean and brisk, yet deeply concentrated with sweet notes of white grapefruit and peach. Blossomy and floral with a bitter lime skin finish.
Tremendous flavors of honey, pear and orange jam are enriched with an oaky vanilla note. It's wonderfully creamy and spicy, and while it seemingly tastes as sweet as a pastry, the finish is dry. Only 425 cases were produced.
Give this wine some time in the glass after pouring (or decant in advance of serving), as it has an earthy edge to its aromas that only dissipates with airing. Once that clears, black cherry and tapenade notes take hold and persist through the warm, open-knit finish.
Founded in 1930 by Ferruccio Grimaldi, this family-run estate is now showing some very exciting results. The La Coste Barolo is a tight and focused wine that promises to age beautifully over many more years. The tannins and acidity are perfectly integrated and the nose boasts bright and intense layers of forest fruit, exotic spice, mesquite and black licorice.
The Hyatt is tight, hard and chewy. Its stiff tannins are calling the shots, and leaving an earthy impression strongly tasting of roots and stems through a somewhat bitter finish. —P.G.
This pure Merlot is made from fruit that was sourced from Bacchus, Conner Lee, Dionysus and Klipsun vineyards. Sappy, spicy and loaded with black fruits, this delivers plenty of flavor across the rich midpalate. Notes of black cherries, coffee grounds, licorice and smoke all come into play.
Ripe black-skinned berry, menthol, new leather and a whiff of iris lead the nose. The vibrant, juicy palate offers wild cherry, black raspberry, star anise and Mediterranean herb while fine-grained tannins provide an elegant, youthfully austere framework. Drink 2017–2022.
This perfumed wine is very aromatic and crisp. It's still young, not yet fully integrating the acidity, spiced fruits and mineral texture. Wait until 2016.
Rutini's value brand exhibits a lot of forced toast, popcorn and burnt notes, all of which tells us that they want us to smell and taste oak. Supporting the wood brigade is syrupy cola and ripe black cherry flavors as well as creamy chocolate finishing notes. Candied but pleasant.
Dry, a bit raw, and dusty in tannins, this Zin offers up a blast of jammy blackberry, cherry and chocolate-covered mint flavors. It's a lusty wine that offers a great deal of everyday pleasure.
This is a modern, powerful interpretation of Sangiovese from Umbria that delivers earthy, leather tones as well as sweet spice and black fruit such as prunes and plums. It's a distinctive, and slightly disjointed wine with a few sharp points and plenty of chocolate spice and cinnamon biscuits in the background. The mouthfeel is big and thick with blueberry flavors and broad nutty tones.
Begins as a toasty, earthy number yet the palate is exceedingly tart. It's slim pickings on the palate, especially if you're seeking depth and richness. Instead there's a lot of acidity and monotony. Adequate but unexciting.
Floral and fruity smelling, this also has notes of dry earth and asphalt. It feels tangy and tomatoey, with saucy flavors of red cherry, tomato and herbs. The finish is herbal, with flavors of oregano and rosemary amplified by zingy acidity.
Tannins are the star here, the tough, young, chewy mountain kind that straitjacket the wine in its youth. But experience shows that cellaring rewards. When the tannins fall out, the sweet, juicy blackberry and cherry flavors can do their thing. This beautiful Bordeaux-style Cab will be best between 2009–2013.
Funky aromas of wet dog, grapy berry fruits and hickory are sketchy. This feels more baked and flat than lively, while flavors of oaky, creamy berry fruits are mildly green. A thick, oaky finish is more gummy than fresh.
This wine resembles Zinfandel, although it's drier and smoother in the mouth, with a silky texture. Nonetheless, it has robust flavors of wild, dried dark fruits and berries, sprinkled with cocoa and black pepper. It's a nice wine to drink now with everything from roast ham to grilled chicken.
This Vermentino opens with a dense, creamy structure and offers fragrant tones of ripe fruit, apricot, pear and a touch of exotic spice. Pair this wine with baked salmon or halibut.
Simple and slightly sweet, with flavors of canned peaches and pineapples, and oak-like vanilla notes.
This is a concentrated, extracted wine that's firm and hard-edged. It has some bitterness while the fruit is missing.
This wine all comes from Rosebud vineyard and is blended with 17% Sémillon. Bright aromas of lees, pineapple, fig and lemon are followed by tart, full-bodied flavors with mouthwatering acidity.
This 80-20 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc shows a bright cherry aroma, with spice, leather and tar notes in the background. It shows a soft, plush feel, with good balance.
There's not much Chardonnay grown on Howell Mountain, but here's one to check out. It has an unusually pungent earthiness, leading to rich flavors of yellow apricots, lemon tart and kumquats, with a complex touch of mushroom. Bone dry and crisp, it should develop bottle complexities over the next 5–6 years.
Reserva in the case of this wine means both a selection of wines and also aging in wood. That gives this ripe wine full spice as well as apricot flavors. It is a creamy, rounded wine, just lit by acidity at the end. Drink from 2018.
Heftier than the producer's Platt Vineyard Pinot, this estate-grown wine features astoundingly bright acidity around dense black cherry fruit. It saw 10% stem inclusion during fermentation and was aged in 20% new oak for just over a year, a recipe that works to buoy the wine and give it plenty of complexity.
An aroma like canned fruit and rather lean flavors make this a basic wine with a narrow profile.
From a dry-farmed vineyard and treated to wild yeast and minimal new French oak, this Petite is chewy in leathery tannins, a definite crowd pleaser for Petite fans. Blackberries, coffee and pepper commingle impressively.
This is a new brand from Gallo, named after a vineyard the Louis M. Martini winery used to designate. It's a rich, sturdy Merlot, with a thick tannin structure, and shows forward flavors of cherries, black and red currants, licorice, blackberry tea, cola and spice. Not an ager, but impressive for its complexity.
Winemaker Chris Camarda is antiformulaic; his wines in 2008 feature radically different blends from the 2007s. This is a third each Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Cab Franc. It reflects the vineyard's penchant for tart berry fruit set atop astringent, mineral-driven tannins. It's tight and dense, with vertical power. Flavors roll gracefully into a medium-length finish.
Almost black in color, this powerful wine from vines in the Douro Superior region is impressively ripe and concentrated. Dark tannins, brooding black plum flavors and a solid age worthy structure will allow this wine to age. Drink from 2018.
Wood laden, this is a spice- and fruit-flavored wine. It's complex, dense and packed with dusty tannins. Still young, although already finely balanced, its structure is powerful and the wine is dark, full and rich. Age for 2–3 years.
One of the more surprising aspects of the glut is the quantity and quality of inexpensive Napa Valley wines. Michael Pozzan, whose forebears began growing grapes in California in the 1800s, has his own 50,000-case winery in Oakville. The Reserve line represents value across several varieties. This dry, stylish Sauvignon is citrusy and figgy, with great elegance, flair and nuance. Dry and crisp, it's as good as many wines costing far more.
Light straw in the glass, this wine is a nice example of the indigenous Turkish grape Narince. The bouquet yields soft notes of guava and white melon, while it is much bolder on the palate, offering flavors of grapefruit, carambola, and eucalyptus. The pleasing of interplay of tropical fruit and cool notes continues into a zesty finish with touches of mint.
Tannic and Porty, with a soft, simple structure framing baked blackberry and currant flavors. Seems hotter than the official alcohol reading of 14.1%.
From the classic sand and flint soil that makes up much of the Sancerre vineyard, this complex wine has both fruit and intense minerality. The touches of toast and almonds round out the still young wine, contrasting with the more steely core. Drink from 2017.
Pure Arinto, this wine brings lemon and pineapple flavors together, giving freshness and fruitiness. It is soft, open, the yellow fruit flavors offering some richness, while the citrus leaves a crisp, clean taste. Fine as an apéritif.
Full-bodied, lush and velvety, this Merlot-based blend from winemaker Steve Smith, MW, features aromas and flavors of smoke, roasted coffee and black cherries underscored by plummier notes. Finishes with dark chocolate flavors and a touch of warmth.
This is a really good Zinfandel. It shows the exuberant, lusty quality of the variety, with wild blackberry, mulberry, tobacco and spice flavors that have a briary mouthfeel. But it brings a classic structure and elegance. Fine now, and the refined tannins suggest ageability through 2012.
This plump, succulent wine is a solid value. Understated toast frames pineapple and melon in this fruit-driven style. Drink this crisp, appealing quaffer now–2018.
With floral violet aromas, leather and meaty notes, this smells bold and ready. A firm, slightly reduced-feeling palate offers blue and black flavors of blueberry, prune and bitter chocolate. The finish is a bit hot and narrow, but shows power and intensity.
Can't call this an elevated or complex wine, but we can say that it's big and bold, with plum, berry and dill aromas. In the mouth, it's not overly vocal but it is fulfilling. Flavors of plum, vanilla and aged cheese are nice, while coconut comes up on the finish. A wine to drink without contemplation.
A simple, rounded wine, soft and fruity. Pear and apricot flavors dominate along with a crisper, grapefruit edge. The wine is aging quickly, and will be ready in a few months.
This 100% Lagrein offers aromas of dark-skinned berries, violets and baking spices. The bright palate delivers ripe black cherries and nutmeg alongside velvety tannins. Enjoy soon.
Summerwood is an up-and-coming winery in western Paso Robles that's doing a good job with Rhône varieties. This Roussanne-Viognier blend is creamy and unctuous, almost honeyed in extremely ripe tropical fruit, buttery oak and spice flavors. Fortunately, the acidity is good.
Made entirely from Pinot Noir grapes, this marks the first offering of this rosé from this ranch in the heart of Carneros. Dry and simple in approach, it delivers a crispness of lemon, lime and strawberry, becoming rich on the palate as it lingers.
Released at the unusually old age of nearly five years, this Pinot Noir is quite acidic. That gives a tart bite to the cherry, cola and oak flavors. It's a bit angular and awkward, but is otherwise silky and dry. Could surprise with another 4–5 years in the bottle.
A tight Merlot, dry and tart, with cherry, tobacco and red currant flavors. A little coarse in texture, but the richness is just fine.

The English Reynolds family arrived in the Alentejo in the 1850s to deal in cork. The vines are in the east of the region, close to Spain. This wine, named after Gloria, the mother of the current owner, is a massive, mature cathedral of a wine. It is packed with dark leather, sweet plums and a dry core that's likely to keep the wine in this finely mature state for many years. Drink now.
A bit ungainly now, with massive red and black cherry flavors that burst out in jammy richness. But this is Mayacamas, whose Cabernets are built to last. The tannins are fierce, the acids entirely adequate to protect this wine through 2012, when it should begin to develop bottle character.

Imported by Wilson Daniels Ltd.

This has grip and polish; it's a terrific first effort from this new winery.
Ethereal aromas of baking spices, cinnamon and berry fruits convey exoticism. This Carignan from 90-year-old vines is saturated and a bit rubbery on the palate. Infinite flavors of nutmeg, spiced plum and berry fruits exude Priorat schist, while everything comes back on a strong finish with measurable tannins. Drink from 2019–2030.
A simple, soft, juicy red wine, full of ripe berry fruits. Delicious now; try it with barbecue. Juice and spice in a bottle. Screw cap.

A bit rustic in style, it's got black currant, raisin and tobacco flavors and lots of peppery spiciness, and the finish is thoroughly dry. But there's a brusqueness to the tannins that makes it feel rough and edgy in the mouth.
Violet, new leather, dark berry and herb aromas take center stage in this young red. The juicy palate offers crushed raspberry, tart cherry and licorice flavors, enveloped in soft tannins and bright acidity. This is what a Rosso should be: fresh, succulent and enjoyable.
This is a flat, broad style of Chianti Classico (with 10% Cabernet) that delivers thick notes of ripe berry, plum, prune, molasses, leather and spice. The tannins are tight and the wine has great length. It has the grit and staying power to pair with succulent cuts of beef or barbecued meat.

This wine is textured, with a firm backdrop to the ripe white fruits. Acidity cuts through everything, giving a fragrant character. Drink this developing wine from 2018.

This is a very fine, elegant Cabernet, with superfine tannins. It should age well throughout the decade.
Plush and rich, but not too meaty or thick, Mediterra (as its Mediterranean-sounding name suggests) delivers aromas of small fruit, wild sage, leather and moist earth. The bouquet paints a pretty picture of the territory in coastal Tuscany that inspired this blended red wine.

Full bodied and rich, this has flavors of apple and lemon, with a warm and ripe feel that is balanced by a final mineral character. It needs several months to come together.
Despite some almost citrusy and asparagus-like aromas, this well-built Cabernet compensates by offering a creamy, supple texture and moderately rich coffee flavors. Finishes a bit astringent and hard, but should soften in a year or two.

Popcorn and baked apple aromas are oaky but not overly woody. This feels fresh but with substance. Flavors of baked apple, woodspice and toast finish healthy, long and with acidic kick.
This is a ripe, soft wine that still tastes young and fresh. The palate is smooth, with a fine citrus zing on the clean finish. Drink now, or keep for two to three years. Available in 2007.

Delas's cuvée parcellaire is a rich wine that's almost syrupy in its concentration and tannic strength. But this definitely has plenty of fruit for balance, mixing cassis with black olive, espresso, cinnamon and clove. Not quite as rich as the '03, but still a classic, with great persistence on the finish. Best after 2015.
Thick, chewy, dense and powerful. The blend is 75% Merlot, 15% Cab Franc, 10% Cabernet Sauvignon. A very fine effort, it's smooth and supple, with alcohol listed (somewhat surprisingly) at 13.5%. Scents mix mocha, espresso, liquid smoke, iodine and black licorice; flavors also run to black and smoky. But there is fruit as well, deep black cherry and cassis, tightly packed and lingering.

This lovely wine is delicately structured, but quite complex and enjoyable. It has a silky texture framing cherry and red currant flavors that are subtlely tinged with sweet pea and oak. Drink now–2017.
Oaky cherry and raspberry aromas are clean and fresh. This feels muscular, with pounding tannins.

The addition of a few drops of Viognier was an important and intelligent winemaking decision. It takes Syrah's blackberries, cherries and currants, which are a little soft and direct, and gives them Viognier's acidic boost, as well as a stimulating cut of lime. Drink this wine soon, but decant it for an hour or two.
Very ripe in the modern style, with masses of jammy blackberries, black currants and black cherries and uplifted, smoky notes of oak. The tannins are thick and astringent. One defect is a certain sharpness that lasts through the finish and makes the mouthfeel tart.

This wine doesn't quite know what it wants to be when it grows up. It vacillates between an intensity of oak, matchstick flintiness and a misplaced sense of austerity.
Broad and sweet, but the sugars are amply balanced by this wine's dusty minerality and dried-spice character. Honey, spice and apple shadings on the nose glide easily into flavors of baked apple on the palate, while the finish possesses a tactile minerality that precisely brings all of the components into harmony. Drink now–2016.

Ripe in strawberry and pineapple and dark pinkish-orange in color, this is straightforward and dry. Smooth and tangy to drink, it's accented in a citrus finish akin to fresh-pressed juice.

A classic Dry Creek Zinfandel, dry, medium-bodied and spicy, with wild berry fruit and that inimitable briary note to the mouthfeel. Really pleasant, with rich, ripe berry, licorice and cedar flavors. Ideal with barbecue.
It's rare to find a varietally labeled Grenache that comes in under 13% alcohol, but here you have it. Blended with 10% Syrah, it has notes of white pepper, smoked meat, savory spices and red fruit. What it lacks in terms of depth it makes up for in purity and elegance.
Burmester's entry into the Douro table wine sweepstakes is a medium-bodied, somewhat leathery wine. Some glue and vinyl notes on the nose, strawberry and rhubarb notes on the palate, and a dry, dusty finish all make for a wine that's decent, nothing more.
Some earthy tones cling to the ripe pear and peach of this wine. A hint of bitterness on the palate is leavened by a bright, pure streak of lemon on a dry and slender body.
A massive Syrah that impresses for sheer volume. It's full-bodied and rich in blackberries, black currants, bacon, black pepper, anise and smoky oak, folded into thick, ripe tannins.

The mouthfeel is silky and delicate, yet the raspberry, cola and buttered cinnamon toast flavors are intense. Drink now–2020.
Dusty and a bit odd on the nose, this has a strange whiff of perfume and resiny oak. The palate is round and layered, with some minerality. Flavors of apple, pear and quince come with a lot of vanilla and raw oak. The finish follows suit with toast and resiny flavors.
Made with grapes from 50-year-old vines, this has a lush veneer of caramelized cherry lavished on top. Aromas include blueberry, leather and exotic spice; it's hard to imagine what to pair this sweet wine with other than aged cheeses.
The steely, mineral character of a Blanc de Blancs is resoundingly evident here. It's fresh on the palate with a crisp texture and vivacious acidity. It's so fruity, it's certainly ready to drink now, but wait a year, and it will show wonderful signs of maturity as well.
A real bruiser of a Zinfandel, dark in color, dry and tannic, brimming with massive flavors of wild blackberries, blueberries, dark chocolate and pie spices. The tannins are hard, in the way of this mountain. Drink Now–2013 before it loses fresh fruit.
Less weighty than some of the other top-rated Hawke's Bay Syrahs, Homage relies on complexity rather than raw power. Its sour plum fruit is perfectly balanced by black olive and roasted meat, hints of bacon and espresso, while the tannins are fine and silky, the acids bright. Drink now–2025.

Generally considered the best of the best single vineyard Pinots from Sineann, this new Resonance is—to quote the late, great Robert Palmer—simply irresistible. Fresh fruit flavors of strawberry, raspberry, sweet cherry and more roll into a lingering aftermath with nuances of cinnamon, cola, chocolate, nougat, coconut and caramel. None of this is overwhelming; the fruit rules. But the finesse and length, which sneaks up on you, are impressive.
Among the 2002 Dolcettos we've sampled, the ones from Dogliani have stood out for their greater depth and intensity of flavor. This one boasts a dark purple hue and dense, plummy fruit. It's a supple mouthful of flavor that goes down easily yet retains a sense of structure and balance.

Made from a slightly smaller percentage (81%) of estate fruit, with the intention of being approachable earlier, this wine has 19% blended in from Oakville Ranch, Knightsbridge and Young Inglewood, including 2% each of Malbec and Cabernet Franc. It jumps from the glass with yeasty black and red berry, a leathery, velvety mouthfeel and a fist of black pepper. Delicious now it should also age well, intense but bright in acidity.
Toasty and creamy, with just a touch of earthy mustiness on the nose; this is like a star just starting to do an elegant fade. There’s tangy fruit with a touch of oxidized maturity, a full texture, but a very faint bead. Good elements abound here and the wine still displays class, but it seems like it might have been brighter before
A full, integrated nose of tobacco, cedar and pepper give this Merlot from Moldova a sultry start. On the palate a nice integration of fruit and spice, albeit a touch oaky and sweet. A bit scrappy overall, but likeable and fun.

Ripe, soft and fruity, with dense sweet fruit. The wine is approachable, an enticing mix of tannins, spice and coffee. With its fruity finish, the wine is sure to please. The quinta was owned by the local postman, and correio is the word for post in Portuguese.
A pleasing nose of citrus laced with lavender paves the way for flavors of lemon-lime, peach and ripe red plum. There is a fleeting sense of stiffness at first sip that is quickly overcome by brightness of fruit that culminates in an apricot finish.
A wine with faults and a few positives. On the nose, it's roasted almost to the point of being overdone. It smells like baked fruit, roasted peanuts and tire tread. Doesn't sound great, does it? But in the mouth its more true and recognizable; flavors of tomato leaf, dried red fruit, vanilla and dill are known entities, while the finish is long and draped with even more dill weed. Drink now. This is not one to save.
Very dry, acidic and minerally, this is not one of those lush, decadent Chardonnays. It shows controlled flavors of citrus fruits, pears, wet stones and spices. The malolactic fermentation was prevented, giving it tangy acidity. Give it a try with shellfish and roast salmon.
A wine that combines richness with sweet cherry flavors and a firm tannic edge. Acidity and ripeness have produced a structured, food-friendly wine.
Smooth, floral berry aromas are easy to like. This crianza feels whole and plump. Lightly herbal tomato flavors blend with richer plum and berry notes in front of a balanced, mostly ripe finish.

A full-bodied, quite ripe expression of the variety with an abundance of baked apple offset by a zest of lime, this wine is rich in vanilla and marshmallow.

This wine offers red berry fruits, the softest tannins and texture and an earthy, rustic aftertaste. Drink now.
Tim Mondavi is back with this interesting Cabernet blend. It's very much in the modern Napa style, soft, rich and sophisticated, with cherry, red currant, Asian spice and new oak flavors. It's an elegant wine, but a fairly tannic one, with a dusty astringency that suggests mid-term aging. An auspicious, if expensive, new beginning.
A firm, structured wine, this is packed with dry tannins as well as rich blackberry and plum flavors. It's solid, chunky and full bodied, and it offers power and concentration. Age this for 4–5 years.

Forward and youthful, this Shiraz shows lifted blueberry and blackberry jam flavors, plus accents of tangy oak and earth. An over-the-top, drink-now wine. Imported by Paterno Wines International.

Aromatic notions of peach precede a fresh, light and easy-drinking palate with zesty acidity.
Trisagio is a Malbec-led blend with Cab Sauvignon and Petit Verdot. It's a dense wine offering the full allotment of berry, earth and meaty aromas. Plump and layered across the palate, this tastes of chocolaty oak, baking spices, herbs, cassis and a pinch of salt. A long, pure finish is a nice topping; drink through 2021.
A spritzy wine, with strongly herbal flavors. There isn't much in the way of fruit, just stems and herbs and chalky tannins.
Aromas of sweat, plum, mocha and melted butter seem dialed back, but they offer plenty of intrigue. The midpalate feels open and accessible, while the finish tenses up a bit with lingering tannins.

Cherry, earth and a tension of dried herb complement each other on the palate, before a lengthy finish of white pepper draped in violets closes things out.
This easygoing blend of Merlot and other grapes that are native to Verona delivers bright cherry flavors with blueberry and white almond. The wine is aged in stainless steel in order to maintain its aromatic freshness,  although it really does have enough heft and determination to pair with light meat dishes.
Pommard and 777 clone grapes were cofermented and aged in a single new Allier oak barrel. Ripe, round and bursting with flavor, this luscious wine is a paean to blackberry fruit. Veins of licorice, espresso and dark chocolate weave through the extended finish. Cellar this for another few years if you can keep your hands off it, but know that it is almost too good to wait for.
The Ursa blend is about 40% each of Merlot and Cabernet Franc, with Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon filling out the rest. Unsurprisingly, there is a forceful streak of herbal flavors running through this wine. It's more focused on the palate than the Star, with riper flavors of blackberry and bramble, albeit with plenty of pepper and stem.
Just a couple of barrels were produced of this vineyard-designate. Tasting of lush strawberry preserves, it's nicely focused, slightly peppery, and offers skin flavors as well as fleshy fruit. Sweet barrel spices carry a hint of clove, and round off a big, delicious finish.
A big, modern, lusty style with dark aromas of cola, chocolate, licorice and immense berry fruit. The palate hits with a wall of tannins, but there's also full-flavored blasts of blackberry, fudge, espresso and licorice. Finishes in form: it's blackened and toasty.
Nicely dry and crisp, with mouthwatering citrus fruit, lemongrass, gooseberry and mineral flavors. Marred by excessively unripe feline notes, however, that bother the palate.
Difficult aromas of cigar ash and hickory are forceful and dominate the nose as a pair. This Tannat stamps across the palate with loud acidity and hard tannins. Toasty woody berry and plum flavors are abrupt on a rough finish.
The wine is soft and lightly textured. It has fruit with ripe apricot and white peach flavors that are lifted by the bright citrus aftertaste. The wine is ready to drink.
This Roussanne, Grenache Blanc and Picpoul blend may be technically dry, but it's so rich in fruity extract, it tastes almost as sweet as an off-dry dessert wine. Yet the acidity is refreshing, giving balance to the peach pie, apricot, pineapple jam, vanilla and honeysuckle flavors.
Plastic and lemon aromas are neither exciting nor inviting. This feels flat and tastes bland and jammy, with mossy berry aromas.
A generic expression of the variety with some notions of ripe plum, dark cherry and black pepper, this straightforward wine is ready to drink now. It takes on full tannic strength on the finish.
Good flavors of cherries, currants and spices, and properly dry and silky, but too acidic. Gives a chili pepper burn throughout. Ready now.
The wonderfully earthy touch of russet pear peel and the freshness of lemon and green apple all appear on the nose. On the beautifully dry incisive palate, the lemon shines through and takes over. This is bright, vivid and fresh but comes with a lovely earthy texture that grounds the soaring lemon freshness. The long finish once again features ripe but tart apple and green pear, but ends in lip-smacking pure lemon zest. Drink 2017–2030 at least.
Super-fruity in pineapples, peaches and sweet vanilla oak, with adequate acidity, this is a rich, forward Chardonnay to drink now with shellfish or mushroom risotto.
Intense dried herb and fennel bulb aromas rule the bouquet, with faint glimmers of cassis and pepper breaking through every now and again. The mouthfeel is soft and the wine overall balanced with delicate tannins and a short finish.
Light fruit flavors run from melon into pale strawberry, with tannins that seem just on the edge of ripeness. Pleasant for the near term, but not for cellaring.
This was not an easy vintage in which to make wine with as much fruit and concentration as this bottling, but winemaker Luisa Ponzi has done it. Deep cherry fruit comes laced with cola and chocolate notes, filling the textural, detailed and full-bodied palate. It demonstrates terrific length and an elegant, balanced finish.
Organically farmed Montepulciano grapes produce a chewy and dense wine with clean cherry flavors and bright fruit nuances. The wine has a solid, slightly gritty texture, and offers muscular intensity and structure.
Sturdy in texture and a bit earthy in flavor, this medium-bodied wine has aromas like raspberries, core flavors like red cherries and a sense of good maturity for drinking now.
Everything about this wine is fine except the sweetness level. The millions of consumers who like slightly sweet whites will welcome it, while a more critical audience will raise an eyebrow. The pineapple, lemon, lime, fig and vanilla flavors taste overtly off-dry. But the wine sure is squeaky-clean.
This is De Loach's finest Zinfandel of their five new releases. In fact, it's their best Zinfandel ever, and one that defines Sonoma County cool-climate Zinfandel. It's brilliant in balance and structure, with beautifully sculpted tannins and fine acidity, and just the right touch of oak. Within that package are savory flavors of wild blackberries, picked at their peak under the summer sun. So easy to drink, yet so complex.
A fine, classic California Sauvignon Blanc that demonstrates showy ripeness balanced with dryness, crispness and low alcohol. The pineapple, lemon, pear and lemongrass flavors have a honeyed finish.
As is the custom, the blend includes 5% Viognier, adding some floral scents that lift the aromas. The 2007 is saturated with a candy/caramel flavor, not unpleasant, but quite prominent. It is not, however, flabby or over-ripe; the buttery flavors work smoothly with the pristine apple, pear and melon-flavored fruit, and the wine has a seamless proportionality that lingers into the finish.
Not clear what Viader was trying to do. Overly soft and featureless in texture, this wine has earthy, dusty flavors with hints of cherries and oak, and a thick, cloying finish.
Notes of honey and cinnamon combine with a slightly musky spice note to give this sweet auslese added interest. It's round in the mouth without being soft or flabby in the slightest, with lingering notes of baked apple on the finish.
A very pretty pale salmon color, this wine offers aromas of strawberry and cherry. The flavor concentration is wanting, not entirely able to hold it all together.
Pitch black, like midnight on a country road. Talk about saturated: the nose yields tar, char and more, and in the mouth it has that midlevel intensity that many of the 2000s don't have. Earthy at one moment, polished the next. It finishes with a sweet blast of molasses, black cherry and coffee. A head-turner, one that gets better with every sip. Imported by Vinifera Imports.
This is a well structured, rich wine. It has solid, ripe red-berry and black-currant fruits that dominate the firmer tannins, giving a juicy, generous feel. Well worth aging for 3–5 years.
This is an awkward, slightly unbalanced wine from northern Italy. It opens with intense notes of mature blackberry and oaky spice but follows through on the palate with sharp, steely acidity.
This 20-acre estate has produced a firm but already attractively ripe wine. It is still young and juicy, with black currant flavors dominating. The tannins are solid and need a while to soften. Drink from 2016.
). Has a Red Willow Cab ever shown this much dense cassis and black cherry fruit, with such high alcohol, massive, chewy tannins and a very long finish? It's almost over the top, but then there are the lovely fruits—a riot of berries and cassis—along with toast and iron, hints of earth and olive.
This is a lovely, lilting and light version of the variety, so rarely found in this appellation. Highly aromatic in white flowers and even a whiff of roses, it dances on the palate, the acidity tight and able to lift the texture to new heights of flavor and freshness. It shows best with food, preferably spicy.
While restrained on the nose, there's plenty of zesty apple, lemon and pear on the palate of this off-dry Riesling. It's an elegant yet quaffable wine with a brisk, crystalline finish. Drink now.

Intriguingly floral and savory upfront, this delicate wine then adds a deep base of ripe cherries that expand effortlessly across the palate, giving an impression of fullness without weight, suppleness without being soft. Finishes long, with a great deal of complexity.
Make this wine a little drier and the score would rise. As things are, it's just too sweet and one-dimensional in jammy raspberries and cherries, while oak brings buttered toast and roasted coconut flavors that are candy sweet. Good as it is, it palls after a while.
Bright aromas of tart apple, melon rind and fresh chrysanthemum dance in the bouquet, while the lively, lightweight palate offers notes of white peach and citrus pith. A subtle astringency graces the close. Drink now.
The winemaker left in a little residual sugar, which gives this pleasant wine a pineapple jam, green apple pie, vanilla sorbet and honeysuckle taste. It's balanced with crisp acidity. From the Los Alamos region, which should have its own appellation status.
This is very well made, smooth and supple. The round, approachable fruit tastes of red currant, red berry, and black olive. There is a flash of heat in the back of the throat, but it offer excellent value. Unfortunately it's very limited—just 99 cases.
This has the look and feel of a fine white Burgundy, with expressive acidity, pinpointed oak, rich creaminess and a certain stony minerality. Yet the fruit is pure California, tropical and succulent. The wine is from the Pisoni family.
This blends 62% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Cabernet Franc and 18% Petit Verdot. Spicy and lean, it was aged in all-new French oak that provides a nice background of structure and strength.

This remarkable wine offers soft luxury between its balance of fresh red cherry and cassis and the velvety grip of tannic concentration. Spiky persistent acidity guides a freshness of forest floor, sage and tobacco, the power entirely graceful in the glass.
A little on the sweet side, with lemonade and pineapple juice flavors that are sugared. Crisp acidity fortunately provides a clean finish to this slightly oaked Sauvignon Blanc.
To the blend of local Aragonez and Trincadeira, the producer has added the Dão's Alfrocheiro. That gives a ripe and attractively perfumed wine. It is soft and juicy, full of rich berry fruits and with a generous, warm texture. Drink now.
This blend of Stillwater Creek and Conner Lee vineyards conveys aromas of pear, yellow apple, pineapple and butter. The concentration is light yet creamy with a warm finish.
This Soussans estate has produced a well-structured 2001, filled with black fruit, underscored by tannins. It has flavors of spice, some herbs and dark, dry tastes. The layers of wood are there, but do not dominate.
Lavish freesia and honeysuckle perfume persists throughout this bristling, bright Riesling. It's delicate and spry in mouthfeel, but rich, round swirls of tropical fruit penetrate deeply on the palate. It's irresistably unabashedly forward and fruity.
Dark and minty smelling, this bears hints of blackberry, perfume and violet. It feels good and not too forceful, with regular Malbec flavors of dark fruit, red plum and spice. The finish is firm and slightly medicinal.
Despite a tough vintage, this is a lush, complete wine. Vanilla and cedar notes on the nose serve to accent the layers of intense—verging on syrupy—blackberry fruit. It's easy enough to drink now, but rich enough that you may want to hold it another couple of years. Just don't expect this one to age more than a decade.
This slightly disjointed wine brings a lot of good things to the table which should integrate with time. For now, there's mushroomy complexity, candied cherry fruit, tart acids and a long, warm finish. Drink 2016–2020.
A lovely, clean Sauvignon Blanc. With no oak, it stars ripe lemon, lime, pineapple, green apple and pear flavors, with the peppery spices the variety displays at its best.
This medium-bodied blend of Touriga Nacional (45%), Touriga Franca (35%) and Tinta Roriz (20%) lacks a bit of flesh, but you wouldn't call it lean, either. Instead, it's sinewy in texture and feel, with masses of blackberry and mulberry fruit upfront and dusty, slightly drying notes on the finish.
Offering aromas of black cherry and vanilla, this wine is soft on entry, with flavors of black cherry, raspberry, chocolate and anise. It is round on the palate, with smooth tannins and a light vein of brightness on the finish.
A Méthode Champenoise blend of 74% Pinot Noir and 26% Chardonnay, this is another in a line of small-production sparkling wines being made by still producers.

This 100% Sauvignon Blanc is forward in citrus, floral, spice and honey flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. A little heavy and full bodied, this has a touch of green gooseberry that makes it exotic and New Zealand style.
Asian pear and Meyer lemon curd form a viscous, sensual core of balanced richness and acidity in this lovely wine, from a set of vineyard blocks planted partly to 40-plus-year-old heritage vines. A stony quality permeates throughout the fruit, combining for a sense of refreshing complexity.
This is a very good Pinot Noir that shows how well the appellation can balance the variety. It has lush cherry, blackberry, tea, cola and cocoa flavors, and a rich, silky texture. Could develop bottle complexity over the next six years.
Simply lovely, from start to finish, this is a wine of breathtaking purity. Fresh boysenberries, blueberries and cherries combine, with a seam of light herbs. It's grounded in dark, precise tannins, and finishes tasting of dark chocolate.
A deep color and an aroma of extreme freshness are the first things to notice, then intense flavors of tart cherry and rhubarb kick in on the palate. This wine is light to medium bodied, and the texture is lively, with lip-smacking acidity and tannin. Best after 2017.
Spearmint and weedy red-fruit aromas lead to raw palate. This is more herbal than fruity, with a lean rubbery finish.
87—89 Barrel sample. Plenty of  fresh blackcurrant flavors here, in a wine that is charming, with its ripe fruits and lively acidity. The fruit is open, dominating the tannins. An early developer.

Intriguing aromas of earth, raw meat, cola, menthol and dark cherry lead into a surprisingly powerful palate of prominent but well integrated tannins, broody dark fruit, and herbaceous flavors. This Pinot should be fascinating to try after a few years in the cellar. Drink 2018–2024.
Rich, full and spiced with generous wood, this is deliciously fat Meursault. Almost honeyed in flavor and given backbone by some minerality; there's good ripeness here. An almost opulent wine.
In an earthy, rather rustic style, this is a wine whose lack of polish is made up for by its hearty berry fruits that blossom in the glass.
The blend includes 5% Viognier, a nice touch from winemaker Joy Anderson, as it adds both spice and lift to the Chardonnay. Lime butter and caramel run through the veins of this supremely smooth and soft offering.
Yummy. Exotically rich, ripe fruit marks this expressive, polished wine. Apple, peach, pear, vanilla, and toast highlight the aroma, and it drinks extravagantly rich without being over the top. The finish is complex and harmonious.
This blend of Roditis and Viognier starts with aromas of fresh lemon blossom, sea salt and jasmine, leading into a nimble and delicate array of citrus and spice on the palate. Clean and focused but with a curvaceous edge.

A very nice wine given the price. The nose features a likable combination of dense berry and leathery spice, while the palate is juicy, ripe and full of black fruit. Not ultra complicated or complex; it's just pure, ripe Malbec in its most approachable form.
A witch's brew of five grapes, the Abondante is a fine wine to pair with pizza, offering interesting flavors of berry and stone fruit. What it lacks in focus, it makes up for with plenty of fruit and some unusual complexity.

Sourced from several vineyards in the heart of the appellation, it represents the vintage and the location well.
A piney, minty, earthy aroma and citrus and herb flavors make this light-bodied wine appetizing. It's dry and well-balanced and has plenty of personality, so drink up.

A stunning and balanced Cab, the El Rom Vineyard boasts ripe blackberry, cherry and cassis aromas and flavors, dusted with accents of cedar, cocoa powder and cigar box spice. Round and hedonistic in the mouth with seductive dark fruit and a mocha-driven finish, this wine is approachable now but can also stand some years in the cellar.

This sweet wine, almost gold in color, is ripe and round. Honey and peach notes complement spice and white pepper flavors. It is soft, rich and ready to drink. Its label does not warn of its sweetness.
Classic Sauvignon Blanc, dry and racy, with high, mouthwatering acidity framing ripe citrus, melon, fig, vanilla and peppery spice flavors. Finishes long in ripe citrus fruit.
This Malbec rosé is peachy and heavy on the nose. That's followed by a plump palate without much acidic kick. Flavors of fading stone fruits turn mildly bitter on a waxy feeling finish. Drink immediately or wait for the next vintage.
This is so rich and saturated you can taste the sunshine in every sip. It bursts across the palate with bright, jammy raspberry and cherry flavors. It may not have great subtlety or ageworthiness, but it excels for its sheer deliciousness.
A full and rounded wine, touched by caramel as well as red plum and ripe strawberries. It is generous, with a soft, open aftertaste. There is a light texture from the acidity that creeps in at the end.

There's a measured richness on the nose of this impressive white, grown in the heart of the appellation's Westside Road neighborhood. Lemony salt and a touch of stone complement the integrated, present oak, rewarded by a complex texture and finish.
A rainy cement minerality on the nose of this sweet wine manages to cut through the sugared oranges, honeysuckle and ripe, tropical white fleshed fruit, from peach to cherimoya. The palate is full of honeyed apples, white peach and pineapple, but the decent acidity and chalky element stops it short of treacly.
Hard to tell the difference between this wine and a Pinot Noir. It's silky, brisk and lightly tannic, with savory raspberry jam, cola, sautéed mushroom and spice flavors. Drink over the next few years for freshness.
For lovers of the rich and ripe Paso Robles style, this is a high-value wine. Aromas of candied black cherry and vanilla pudding meet with roasted game and crushed gravel on the nose. Vanilla holds strong into the palate, where it blends with blueberry syrup and blackened caramel. Well-measured acidity and chalky tannins complete the experience.
Meaty, with a sexy bass line of plum. Tannins are smooth; accents are of vanilla bean, and some easy toasty, woody notes. Broad but not abyss-deep, but still very enjoyable and drinkable. Imported by USA Wine West.
This entry-level look at the family vineyard that overlooks Ballard Canyon and beyond brings scents of graphite, pepper, blackberry and dried, slightly dank herbs. It's tight and tart at first on the palate, with skins of black cherry and plum unwinding into pencil shavings, oregano, wood and emergent mushrooms. The tannins are best for drinking 2017–2025.
The grapey scent of Muskateller does not quite shine through on the nose of this light-bodied yet textured, unusual blend, but it freshens and colors the flavor. Refreshing and versatile with a satisfyingly zesty, dry finish.
Scents of exotic fruit and flower petal come doused with a note of peach yogurt. Overall, it smells bright and high-pitched, but it lacks some depth. It tastes sweet and feels pliant, with easygoing acids and slender flavors of golden stone fruit.

A wine with good bottle age along with yeasty acidity and a fine citrus character. It is a light style, with just a hint of toast. The acidity is delicious.
Ripe and jammy, with tons of blackberries, cherries, currants and chocolate, wrapped into smooth, drink-me-now tannins. Not a whole lot going on below the surface, but a pleasant, easy sipper.
This wine shows shows characters of berry fruits and soft tannins, matched by juicy acidity. Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend gives the structure while Trincadeira and Aragonez provide the smooth fruits. Drink now.
A controversial wine I'm sure, as I couldn't even make my mind up about it. Tasted from three separate bottles, on one occasion it was positively stunning and would have rated 94 points—it was filled with explosive stone fruit notes, ranging from peach and apricot to plum and cherry; lush but not unstructured. Unfortunately, the two other bottles showed some volatility and more subdued fruit, so I've tempered my rating to reflect that.
Good raspberry, cherry, orange tea, Dr. Pepper and Asian spice flavors in this wine, brightened with crisp acidity and wrapped into a silky texture. Seems a bit simple and direct though. Probably best in the next few years. From Hop Kiln.

Delicately scented, this offers subtle aromas of beeswax, yellow stone fruit, Spanish broom and a whiff of Mediterranean scrub. The vibrant elegant palate doles out yellow apple, nectarine and candied lemon drop alongside bright acidity. A savory saline note lingers on the finish.
With flavors that range from nectarine through grapefruit and brush up against bell pepper, this is a broad-spectrum Sauvignon Blanc that should prove versatile with food. It's medium-bodied, with a dry, slightly minerally finish.
This is an attractive, plump white blend for early consumption. Pineapple and toasted almond notes mark the nose, while the fruit flavors on the palate are subtly reminiscent of pineapple and melon.
Strong oak aromas and flavors wrap around this full-bodied, rather tannic and bold Merlot. It shows ripe fruit flavors and a gripping texture that makes it appropriate to match with red meat. Blended with 20% Cabernet Sauvignon.
Lots going on in this complex young Chard. It shows crisp, zippy acidity and a firm, steely minerality that marries well with the oak and lees to produce a coconut cream pie, macaroon richness. That's on top of the tropical fruit. Delicious now, and should hang in there for four years or so.
A very nice, sleek Chardonnay that shows you don't have to pay a high price for a good wine. Fermented in stainless steel, it received brief exposure to oak in the form of staves. The wine is bone dry and earthy, with rich flavors of pineapples, herbs, buttercream and cinnamon spice.
Iron Horse has one of the most consistent Viognier records in California, with a style all their own. From their mountain vineyard in Alexander Valley, the '06 shows tremendous balance, with an exciting tension between dry, minerally acidity and Viognier's exotic fruit and wildflower flavors. The wine was stainless-steel fermented and did not undergo malolactic fermentation, which helps account for the cleanliness.
This wine has a lovely rustic component that suggests forested earth and leaves. Juicy and explosive in cardamom and black cherry flavors, it offers a full-bodied experience of ripeness and concentration.

This is a soft fruity wine with ripe strawberry flavor. It has a touch of pepper as well as crisp acidity in the background. Drink now.
Smells young, closed and dusty, with toast accenting cocoa and cherries. Very dry, tannic and earthy. Finishes astringent in tannins. Needs lots of time but should be a very good bottle by 2008.
One of the best expressions from the classic Cannubi vineyard area, this fragrant red is all about finesse, opening with enticing scents of perfumed berry, iris, rose, chopped herb, baking spice and new leather. The vibrant palate boasts structure as well as an almost ethereal elegance, delivering succulent red cherry, crushed strawberry, cinnamon and licorice wrapped in refined tannins. Bright acidity lends impeccable balance. Drink from 2021 through 2043.

Beautifully feminine, with a delicate cherry-blossom perfume, this off-dry rosé sparkler blends juicy cherry and strawberry flavors, with a hint of earthy, mushroom goodness. Medium sized bubbles are brisk and tonic on the finish.
The honeyed wine has just a touch of botrytis as evidenced by the dry edge to the apricot and marmalade flavors. There is plenty of delicious refreshing acidity to balance the sweetness of this poised and stylish wine. Drink late 2017.
A full-bodied, ripe Pinot Noir that has gained concentration from the vintage, this has red plum and raspberry flavors, with smooth tannins and a dense texture. There is a smoky note from the wood.
Bright fruit freshness dominates this wine. The fruit is pure, vivid. light and crisp. The acidity is important here, driving the wine in a mineral direction.
Even by De Loach's standards of enormously ripe Zinfandels, this one stands out. It's a hydrogen bomb of a wine, fantastically rich in berries and fruits that have a slightly dried quality to them. The tannins are thick, and the alcohol seems higher and hotter than the stated 14.5% by volume.
Brisk minerality and a hint of hazelnut add savory tones to this blend of indigenous Georgian Rkatsiteli and Chardonnay. It's dry and full-bodied, yet surprisingly sprightly, with bright acidity and delicate flavors of stone fruit and citrus rind.
Tremendously delicious, this bottling combines hedonistic flair with elegant depth, satisfying both carnal and intellectual desires. Waves of hot cherry pie with vanilla ice cream and cola spice show on the nose, but the sip grows more dry and refined. Black cherry is enhanced with crushed nutmeg, black pepper and a pinch of dill, balanced via underlying acidity and a leathery tannic frame.
This is a ripe, somewhat creamy style of Côte Rôtie, with potent mocha notes complementing hints of clove, olive and plum. The tannins are silky-supple on the finish, so don't hesitate to pop a cork soon. Drink now–2021.
From the stony Kritt vineyard, this is a concentrated, youthful wine. It combines fresh acidity with fruity richness with a dry, firm character. It's an impressive wine and certainly appropriate for aging further. Drink from 2015.
The best wine in the El Origen portfolio is this Torrontés from northerly Cafayate. It's true to the blueprint, showing fresh lychee, honeydew and acacia aromas, which are followed by lemon-lime flavors, green-herb notes and a touch of citrus pith. Drink now to enjoy this one's lingering tropical freshness. Imported by Carolina Wine Brands USA.
This is one of Louis Latour's flagship reds, a powerful wine, with its dense, solid fruits, big tannins and concentration. Those black plum juices are building up behind a firm layer of dryness. Wait until 2012 before even considering drinking.
This straightforward red opens with aromas suggesting stewed plum, prune and a hint of nutmeg. The jammy, extremely approachable palate offers black cherry, clove and cinnamon alongside rounded tannins. Drink through 2018.
Cherry and plum aromas are dry, earthy and direct. This is a straightforward aged Rioja with grabby tannins but enough body and fruit to absorb them. Baked cherry and plum flavors are a touch rustic and stalky, while a roasted aftertaste sends this on its way. Drink through 2019.
High alcohol makes this Grenache seem hot and sweet in glycerine. It tastes candied, with cherry pie and red licorice flavors.
Classic spicy Muscat flavors show on a dry wine, giving notes of spiced pears, baked apples, nutmeg and the crispest acidity. Think light and fresh Gewürztraminer, but with acidity, and you are not far off. Glass stopper.
There's a slight pink hue to this light-bodied white. Citrus focused and a bit blossomy, this is simple and straightforward yet perfectly enjoyable.
Heavily stewed and frankly it smells vegetal, with soupy aromas of corn, tomato and squash. Lacks vital fruit and definitely smells and tastes heavily herbal. That said, the wine has good feel and texture. Not sure why this wine tastes significantly more soupy, corny and green than the previous vintage.
Deep, sweet and lusty on the nose, with a hint of animal and whole lot of black fruit. The palate is saturated and jammy, with roasted, ripe berry flavors and a ripe, silky finish. Not hard or tannic in the least, with a spot of Priorat's patented schisty minerality. Drink now through 2015.
Loaded up with toast and vanilla, as you might expect from Tardieu Laurent, but the wine shows plenty of weight and concentration under the wood, and some underlying pear and melon fruit ultimately finds its way out. It's a rich, succulent mouthful of oak and fruit for near-term drinking.
A big (15.6% alcohol) wine, the 2006 Bella's Garden nevertheless comes across as balanced and drinkable in its youth, marrying a rich, creamy texture with mixed berry fruit and hints of mint and vanilla. Avoids any cooked character, finishing long and fresh. Drink now–2015.
So rich and powerful in fruit. Blackberry and cherry jam, mocha, cola, tobacco, black pepper, anise, licorice, beef jerky, it's all there, on steroids.
This is the winery's third vintage, and they continue to make elegant, supple and snappy wines. This is the ripest to date, and has a healthy 14.7% alcohol level, but it retains many of the spice and herbal highlights that keep it interesting. The fruit brings on berries, plums and some of the brambly character of Zinfandel; the barrels add clove and nutskins. Cola and sassafras wrap into the sharp finish.
Vintner Roberto Cipresso presents a dense and rich blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot from Sicily with ripe aromas of prune, blackberry and black pepper. The wine is dark and thick in the mouth and would pair with grilled steak.
This bright, savory wine delivers aromas and flavors of juicy wild cherry, black raspberry, violet, white pepper and mocha. Polished tannins provide the framework. Enjoy through 2020.
Baked spiced apple on nose and palate is met with tangerine freshness and an almost quinine-like very slight but alluring bitterness. At the core there are power and heat, creating a counterpoint to the zesty fruity freshness. This is powerful and concentrated, moreish and just off dry.
This full-bodied wine has a smooth texture that is mouthfilling and rich. It offers mild, savory mineral flavors that complement the creaminess and prolong the finish, while subtle oak flavors contribute to its sense of smoothness and viscosity.
Hailing from a single vineyard in Michigan's southern AVA, this is a Cabernet Sauvignon-dominant blend (77%), with Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Petite Verdot making up the difference. This has cooked-down bramble berry aromas on the nose, and also brings to mind twings and stems. The medium-bodied palate shows a bit more character, with juicy black berry and red currant flavors elevated over green peppercorn and medium-grained tannins.
Made from organically farmed grapes, this 50/50 blend of Montepulciano and Sangiovese opens with funky farmyard aromas and notes of leafy underbrush. The palate oozes dense, overripe black berry and prune. The heavy, extracted palate finishes on a sweet note, but lacks balance and freshness.
This is somewhat lean, but its elegantly tailored in its brisk acidity and dryness. While the cherry and berry flavors are modest, the wine's austerity makes it versatile with an enormous range of foods.
This wine looks clear, with aromas of chewing gum, watermelon and cherry. The palate is regular and nebulous in feel, while flavors of melon and peach are slightly oxidized and pithy. A blend of 50% Tempranillo with 30% Garnacha and 20% Viura.
Roasted notes infiltrate aromas of raspberry fruit. This feels mostly chunky, choppy and soupy, while herbal flavors of tomato and blueberry finish scratchy and a bit hot.

More “red” in style, with medicinal cherry and raspberry aromas leading to a fresh, racy palate with tons of cherry and plum flavor along with a hint of cola and cough drop.

Heavily oaked and loaded down with butter and resin, this is a wine for those infatuated with the obscure. The blend is 90% Callet and 10% Fogoneu, and don't ask us to give you the history of these Mallorcan grapes. Suffice it to say that this wine is broad, a bit stewy and very different. It's not heavy like an anchor but it has its chunky shoulder pads to deal with. Only 25 cases made.

Not only is this 100% Assyrtiko, it's fermented and aged entirely in stainless steel, which completely preserves its biting acidity. It has some waxy, citrusy aromas and flavors, but they are secondary to the wine's dominating acids, which leave the mouth clean and tingling after each taste.

Soft and round, this is still coming around. Its fruit flavors are muted by wood and spice, although it already shows richness. It will be an opulent, full wine, with deliciously ripe fruits.
Here's a Cabernet to age for a while. It's very dry and richly flavored in classic varietal flavors of blackberries, black currants and cedar, with finely ground, intense tannins. But it has a youthful immaturity that simply isn't ready to appreciate now. Really needs time for all the parts to mesh together. Give it until 2012, and it should develop bottle complexity for another 5–6 years.
This still-young crisp wine is full of apple and citrus acidity. The mousse is lively, giving a bright character to this fruity wine. Because it is so dry, it needs another few months before drinking, so wait until 2018.

Nelson Family Vineyards is quietly making some mighty nice aromatic white wines, all estate-grown from their property. This Riesling is opulent and fragrant with orange blossom and honey on the tongue, medium in weight with a little residual sugar (officially off-dry) and 12.6% alcohol.
Stone fruit like apricot and white peach dominate on the nose of this wine that tastes slightly off dry, though no residual sugar content is listed. Hedonistic, it remains rich and creamy through the honey-laced finish.

This boutique Chianti Classico (only 600 cases are made) has a modern, sweet-smelling nose with evident tones of toasted almond, vanilla and coconut that are framed by delicate nuances of blueberry and blue flower typical of Sangiovese. It's lean and compact in the mouth with a burst of fresh fruit on the close.
This is a bit thin on the palate, with flavors of sour black-cherry candy and spice. It earns a few extra points for its elegance and fine tannins.
If a whiff of volatility doesn't turn you off, this tightly layered reserve from Hogue has a lot going for it. Gobs of cherry and cassis fruit, dense and deep, roll into veins of earth, olive and graphite. A big wine with plenty of life ahead.
From the warmer reaches of the appellation below Mount St. Helena, with vines that have been farmed by the same family since the 1920s, Falleri is a gorgeous wine.

Tight aromas of berry, tar, smoke and roasted hazelnut open this wine. It's linear, silky and long on the finish, with a fine quality of tannin.
Michele Satta's estate is located in the southernmost part of the denomination. This Sangiovese-based wine offers delicate nuances of blackberry, spice box and dried hay but also has natural rubber or Band-Aid notes that disturb an otherwise pretty picture. Drink now.
The aromas bring notes of dried and fresh herb, citrus twist, baking spice, wood spice and cherry. The cherry and pencil lead flavors show a sense of poise and polish.
Flavors of blackberry, black cherry and a streak of cola ignite the palate, with a layer of pure mineral underneath. At first a bit delicate, this never pauses, introducing umami and cinnamon highlights on the lingering finish. It's fresh and elegant, with a more gentle fade than some of the more potent Syrahs from Cayuse.
Stainless steel-fermented and kept on the lees for two months, this new vintage still feels a bit dilute—a function of the low brix and difficult vintage. Pungent with scents and flavors of rosemary and citrus, it is best drunk chilled and young.
A very limited production wine from a new Walla Walla vineyard, this was barrel fermented in neutral oak and softened up with partial malo. It leans a bit more toward the citrus/pineapple flavor side than does the winery's regular Chardonnay bottling. This is a bit crisper, with subtle grassy highlights adding some lift and interest.
Zippy and brisk, this light-bodied, dry Riesling is strikingly racy in style. Hints of white blossoms and fresh herbs add some complexity, but it's a fairly straightforward wine enjoyable for its squeaky-clean demeanor.
Wood aging gives this Reserva in the Periquita range an elegant and smooth texture. It's rich on the palate, while allowing plenty of room for spice and blackberry fruit over a layer of firm tannins. This is a finely structured wine that can age for another year.
For what should be a special bottling, this vintage of Icon SB seems a little deficient. It's still a nice wine, but gives the restrained impression of underripe fig and green tomato without being overly herbal or expressive.

Here's a simple, clean white wine that opens with grassy tones, citrus and stone fruit aromas. The mouthfeel is somewhat heavy and thick.
Here's another exceptional Oregon Riesling to add to the growing ranks of top producers. Lemon-drop fruit meets peaches and cream in the mouth, as this off-dry (20g/L) wine displays a spot-on balance between acid, sugar, fruit and honey. This is delicious already, and built to age nicely over a decade or longer.
Blended mainly from Grenache, with 20% Syrah, this is one of the biggest, most extracted red wines ever to come out of Paso Robles. The alcohol is a ridiculously high 16.2% by volume, but it's balanced the same way that high alcohol in Port is balanced. The flavors are enormously rich with raspberry and cherry jam, white chocolate and buttered toast. Heady and flashy in that distinctly California mode, and made for drinking now.
This young wine brings scents of cola, truffle and black cherry. It's light and lively, with those flavors coming along with notes of chicken stock and a juicy mouthfeel. Though not a big wine, it's complex and interesting.
This is the winery's top Cabernet. The '09 is very ripe, rich and forward, offering powerful blackberry, cherry and currant flavors that are wrapped into soft, gentle tannins. It's quite good, but it needs a couple of years in the bottle. Best around 2015.

Flavors of yellow fruits and pink grapefruit are balanced in this wine. There's a hint of spice, with attractive, taut acidity that adds structure to the wine.
A funky glint of smoke and yeast precedes rich notions of mirabelle and peach compote.

The wine is crisp and lightly herbal. It has a good citrus edge that is filled out with warmer peach and currant flavors. There is a good tangy texture as well that gives an attractive bite. The wine is ready to drink.

There is huge concentration and big aromatic intensity on the midpalate with a lovely bitter edge that lasts long. There is a medium-sweet finish.
Dark gold in color and mightily textured, this lovely wine is medium-bodied and salty in pear, mango an pineapple. The flavors are subdued and nuanced, finding their way within layers of acidity and refined oak.
This Brunello offers interesting complexity in its cola and balsam notes. The wine has a big, bright intensity, with crisp acidity and a lean, compact mouthfeel that's rather austere and stern. Ultimately the wine is more generous on the nose than in the mouth and finishes with lasting freshness.

Let this very young, tart Sauvignon Blanc breathe for a while. That will get rid of most of the feline essence, which are really strong on opening, and let richer notes of figs, melons and citrus fruits emerge.
This wine is particularly fruity with red-currant and raspberry flavors right up front. Crisp and lively, it is bone dry and packed with acidity as well as the great fruitiness. Ready to drink now. The 12th-century estate has been in the same family since the early 19th century.
A very good showing for this wine, which should be on all value-conscious shoppers' lists. Mint accents black cherry and cassis fruit enriched by some chocolaty notes. Tannins are plentiful but ripe, giving it the necessary heft to stand up to grilled steak.
Ripe, juicy and simple, with blackberry-infused espresso flavors that finish with some sweetness.

The balance between the wine's richness and more ethereal components is nicely drawn.
Very lush and ripe in blackberry, cherry, currant and cassis flavors, with an oaky overlay, and there's a minerality toward the end that smacks of the soil. With an acidic jamminess and fierce tannins, the wine feels austere and remote. Give it 6 or 7 years in the cellar to come around.

Not as impressive as Galoupet's white or rosé, this blend of Syrah (60%), Grenache (20%) and Mourvèdre (20%) shows a strong earthy, minerally component garnished with bits of cedar and spice.

Nicely done for an entry-level wine, with slate, fresh floral greens and briny minerality all wrapped up in an off-dry cocoon of green apples and citrus fruits. Fresh and clean on the finish.
Four qualities distinguish this Barbera. It's bone dry, high in acidity, rigidly tannic and rich in cherries. By itself, it's rustic and old-fashioned. But it's the kind of wine the oldtimers drank with the cheese, meat, bread and sauce, and so should you. Like any respectable Barbera, it will age for decades, softening and sweetening without necessarily gaining complexity.
A wonderfully funky notion of yeast precedes the full ripe yellow plum fruit on the nose and segues into a salty, spicy and peppery palate. Concentration and flavor reverberate with a lemony citrus zing. A great varietal expression of Grüner's dual spice and fruit nature in an elegant package with lots of drive.

Not quite off-dry, but with a little sweetness, an earthy, chocolatey wine that's neither here nor there.
Silly name but pretty good wine. A tidal wave of cherry/berry aromas is authentic, natural, youthful and floral. The palate is just as bright and bouncy, with red fruit running away with things. A touch of mineral and chocolate at the end gives it some darkness to match the vibrancy.
Here's a sound, everyday-style Cabernet for drinking now. It's dry and tannic, with rich flavors of blackberries, black currants and plums, enhanced with sweet, smoky oak.
The ripeness of this wine stands out. The cherry flavors even have a slightly raisined edge. The wine is also fairly tannic. Additional flavor nuances include tangerine zest, wild raspberry, red currants and white pepper. This is a great Hanzell. Give it until 2010, and it should develop interesting bottle complexities for many years.
Give this wine as much airing time as possible, because she starts out with pickled, rustic Carmenère aromas that haven't been softened by oak or anything else. Oxygen tames the funk and allows cherry and plum flavors to emerge. As for mouthfeel, it's clearly the wine's calling card: the palate is racy but smooth, with proper tannins and lively acidity.
A barrel-selection from multiple vineyard sources, this offers black cherry fruit highlighted by root beer and black licorice. Aging nine months in 25% new barrels adds pleasant toastiness to the finish.

This combines bold fruit flavors reminiscent of peach or nectarine with leafy, herbal notes. The tomato and celery leaf tones provide a cool contrast to the ripe fruit, and a burst of crisp acids on the finish keeps the wine refreshing.
This is a ripe, full and fruity wine. It is packed with attractive red-berry fruits and a crisp dry backbone. The acidity and the bright aftertaste make it a fine food rosé. It comes from a small appellation surrounded by the large Côtes de Provence area.

Opens with a spicy nose of raspberry, Christmas cake and plum pudding. There isn't a lot of ripeness or concentration on the palate but this is a very likeable wine that is crisp, elegant and light on its feet. There's only a gentle dusting of tannins, making it a suitable partner for heartier varieties of fish. Drink up before 2012.
Totally sumptuous peach notes dance on nose and palate. They are boosted by plump sweetness and given shape by zesty freshness. Everything about this is opulent and intense. The freshness of 2014 makes it lip smacking and bright, despite all of its richness. This finishes medium sweet while the peachy flavors last and last.
Firm and minerally, with zippy acids framing oak-touched mango, pear and sautéed banana flavors. Not a big Chard, but an elegant, crisply dry one.

Dark violets, sagebrush, olallieberry and a touch of smoked plums greet the nose on this bottling by Jeremy Weintraub, winemaker for Adelaida and formerly Seavey, who is focusing this project on renowned vineyards. The palate is high and tight at first with sanguine and iodine elements, opening toward black pepper, licorice, black and red currants and broader cherry flavors.
A compellingly fresh herbal component characterizes this wine, particularly in the aroma. Still-tight tannins give a bitter note. Soft and ripe in blackberry and black licorice, it's a wine to enjoy now with a grilled steak dotted in peppercorns.
Here's a nice Merlot that's drinking well now. It has soft, fine tannins and a crisp spine of acidity, while the flavors run to ripe blackberries, coffee, cocoa and smoky leather.
Not at all a typical Sauvignon Blanc, this smells like apricot and honeysuckle and tastes like marmalade. It is dry, yet tastes like a late-harvest dessert wine. Expect a little taste adventure here.
Chunky aromas of tomato, saucy berry fruits, asphalt and tire rubber are somewhat harsh. Flat and lazy in feel, this chunky, full-bodied number from Bío Bío tastes of baked cherry and plum fruit. A finish with low acidity and not much kick is the ending.
This wine includes 8% Petite Sirah and smaller amounts of Petit Verdot, Syrah, Zinfandel and Merlot, fleshing out a rich, full-bodied embrace of chewy tannin and extracted blackberry and brick tar. Let it hang in the glass awhile and swirl a time or two to get it to speak.
The aromas and initial taste are all of new wood. Only later does some fresh red fruit appear, giving the wine a lift. There is enough fruit here, but this needs time for the wood to calm down. Then the wine will show the vibrancy the structure suggests.
Herbal blackberry aromas include gritty notes of road tar and eucalyptus that are derivative of the Petit Verdot and Cab Franc that have been mixed into this Carmenère. Sandpaper tannins create a dry scratchy mouthfeel, while peppery, spicy, blackened berry flavors finish with massive tannins. Drink this bullish bomber through 2023.

Plump and ripe in style, with a lot of charm to its personality. This is very nice and simple Tempranillo (with 15% Garnacha and Graciano), and it's ready to drink now. The feel is on the flush side, and there's jamminess to the palate along with light pickle notes and vanilla on the finish. Coming along nicely; this review reflects an improvement over a tasting done in May 2007.
Serious and earthy, like walking into a wall of minerality. The fruit takes a back seat here, but is lusciously peachy and fresh while the long finish is sparked by hints of exotic spices. Give this two to three years to show its best.

This is a medium- to full-bodied Pinot with plenty of concentration and ripeness. You get ripe black cherries upfront and all the way through the long finish—the only thing this wine really needs is more complexity. Pretty good value.

Lovely and lilting, like a cloud in a glass. Shows true Pinot essence in the silky texture and rich flavors of cherries, black raspberries, cola, mocha and pepper spice, firmed and toned with crisp Carneros acidity.
Crisp, clean and clear Chardonnay, soft and attractive, the fruit on the citrus side, but with some red apple skin juice to make it richer.
Fresh juicy pear has a touch of bergamot zest on the nose that lends a heady enticing note. That same aromatic zesty touch pervades the entire palate, perfuming the rich ripe pear fruit and providing a wonderfully bright firm structure. There is a warm energetic core to this wine and quite some warmth, but this is beautifully countered by the citrus freshness. Right now all the notions are primary and delicious but this will evolve and develop. The concentration certainly is there. Drink 2017–2035.
This bottling shows the richness that a well-grown Santa Lucia Highlands Pinot Noir can achieve, seemingly effortlessly. You'll find deeply ripe raspberry, cherry and cola flavors, wrapped in a silky texture. However, there's quite a bit of sharpness that draws into question the wine's ageability.
Valamasca is a bright and foamy Moscato d'Asti with cheerful aromas of white flower, honey, peach and dried hay. The creamy effervescence feels thick and smooth in the mouth and the wine would pair with baked desserts or fruit.
A finely perfumed wine, but one with a tight initial structure. Ripe wild strawberries and mulberries appear with dry tannins and spice from wood. The finish underlines that this is a wine for aging, with its structure and firmness. Keep for 4–5 years.
With grapes from the Limoux region, the coolest in Languedoc, this wine goes for structure, with stalky, dry tannins. Those flavors, and the black currant fruits, are offset by considerable soft finishing sweetness.
Juicy and smoky with a taste of tar, this full-bodied wine is soft and integrated in terms of oak. Black cherry, blackberry and strawberry play on the palate against measured acidity and weight.
A slightly darker shade of yellow in the glass, this bottling offers a creamy cider-like nose, full of corn tortilla, dried mandarin and lemon-pith aromas. The palate is quite tart at first, but the midpalate offers that corn-like warmth before the finish shows more sour apple and ashy cheese-rind flavors.
A clean, light wine with cherry and cinnamon notes on the nose and in the mouth. This isn't heavy or deep, but tasty, and evenly textured. Elegant herb and mineral shadings show on the close of this attractive easy drinker. Would do well with a very light chill. —M.M.
A beautifully crafted, elegant red wine with sharp acidity, violet aromas and dense and wild red fruits. Still compact and young, this vintage and cuvée will need a lot more time to evolve. Deep purple fruits and streaks of earth and licorice and coffee suggest a long life ahead for this baby.
Big-time tannins make this blend of all five classic Bordeaux varieties tight in character. Underneath the astringency are intense flavors of blackberries, cherries and currants that are liberally oaked. Dry and refined, the wine will develop bottle complexity after 2018.
A proprietary red blend, nonvintage and nonappellation-specific beyond California, this is a soft, thin rendition of Tempranillo and friends, boasting notes of game and pepper that might do well alongside a roast chicken (or duck) coated in buttery herbs.
Rubbery, smoky berry aromas turn more dusty and earthy with airing. The palate is forward and fresh in feel, with herbal plum and spicy red-berry flavors. Notes of herbs and olive dominate a solid finish.
From a relatively cool growing region, this Shiraz-Viognier is appropriately peppery and bright, with a hint of violets and crisp blueberry and blackberry fruit. The tannins are soft, making this wine instantly accessible, and it finishes peppery and fresh. Drink now–2012. Imported by Tom Eddy Wines.
The firm tannins of Saint-Estèphe are strongly in evidence in this wine that is dry, dense and only hinting at fruit. While there is some juicy acidity, it also has a bitter character that needs some time to soften. It will probably always be on the dry, structured side. Drink from 2019.
Soft and pretty, this marries light spice to fruit flavors of apple and strawberry. Think blanc de noir without the sparkle and you're on the right trail. It's got substantial palate weight and a fairly thick mouthfeel.
Candied berry aromas include a mild spice note. This 50-50 blend of Cabernet and Malbec feels juicy but short on depth. Spicy, briny red-fruit flavors dry out on a finish with red bell pepper and black-pepper notes.
Chalk and the merest touch of honey, a little lanolin and lots of lemon and lime peel: that describes the complex nose of this dry Riesling from the wondrous 2008 vintage. The palate is poised and dry, its lightness accentuated by the rich, stony flavors around its core. Lemon freshness runs throughout. The finish is gloriously long.
While there is crisp, green fruit here, this wine is much more about its richness, softness, roundness. There is some minerality, and the flavors of pear and citrus come through strongly on the finish.
Subtlety paints an emergent nose of lemon zest and honeysuckle, given richness with dollops of cream. It's light and airy on the palate, but flavorful with lychee, roasted nuts, sea salt and buttered popcorn, ending in an oak-kissed finish. This will be fun to track over the years, so drink 2018–2022.
Extremely woody aromas of cedar meet with prunes, tobacco leaf and nutmeg on the nose of this bottling from a property south of San Jose. That woody character also plays powerfully on the palate, mixing with baked blueberry flavors to achieve a sort of balance. The tannins makes for a squeaky texture on the finish.
Bold lychee, honeydew and stone-fruit perfume adorns this varietally classic Gewürztraminer. Its tastes just a shade off dry, its hibiscus-nectar sweetness accenting sunny tangerine and peach flavors. Sunny acidity and integrated alcohol tie the package together smartly. Drink now through 2020.
Smells nice as aromas of lemon curd, honeysuckle and lychee fruit make for a very Viognier-like bouquet. But it is indeed Chardonnay, and the palate of lemon, apple and orange is driving and touched up by forward but controlled oak. Lengthy on the back end, with a kiss of butterscotch. Not refined or Burgundian, but good for Navarra.
Just about the most perfect Sonoma Zin from a typicity point of view. It's gorgeously balanced, offering polished wild cherry, cassis, cola, lavender and white peppery spice flavors in an opulent, smooth texture. The finish is richly dry and crisp.
Tart cherry, baking spice and dried chaparral show on the nose of this appellation blend from pioneering vintner Richard Sanford and Nick de Luca, making for a soft and easy entry. It's light and refreshing on the palate, with a bit of tannic depth, offering dried cranberry, juniper and garrigue-inflected flavors. Lively and vibrant with herbal depth.
Just bottled, this wine is young, fruity and full of black cherry and red plum flavors. Combined with this is a firm character and a structure of tannins that demand aging over at least 2–3 years.
Heavily reduced citrus on the nose, with more piercing citrus and mango on the palate. Finishes racy but scouring. Some nuttiness and charm lurks below the spiked acidity, but you have to work to find it.
This is a small property under the same ownership as Château Paloumey. It is unusual in the 20% Petit Verdot that goes into the blend. That gives the wine its deep color and rich generous black-plum fruit. Solid and dense, the wine will age well. Drink from 2020.
The ripe aromas are the sign of a wine that is rich, weighty and intense. This is a vinous Champagne, rich in full-bodied yellow and white fruits, definitely suggesting rich foods. Ten years on, it is developing well, but could be cellared for several more years.
There's a hint of violet perfume that permeates this dry yet honeyed wine. The palate is fruity, with abundant ripe cherry and grapefruit flavors, and layers of crushed chalk and stone lend a minerally complexity that builds on the midpalate.
Strikes a nice balance between the softness of the '08 and the firmness of the '07. A beautiful Zinfandel, made in the winery's style of big, ripely extracted fruit and high alcohol. Massive in raspberry and cherry jam, red licorice, gingersnap cookie, cola, clove, black pepper and smoky cedar flavors, its extraordinary richness is balanced with fine, thick tannins.
Stewed dark fruit with leather and spice accents show on the nose of this angular, narrow wine. Very dry on the tongue, it offers black coffee and smoke flavors and high acidity. A taut finish closes this lean machine.
This luminous vintage-dated sparkling wine from northeast Italy recalls the freshness and ease of the popular Prosecco category. Cut grass, spring flower, talc powder and citrus form the bright bouquet.
Quiet aromas of peach and nectarine are subdued in nature. This feels melony, with pulpy weight cut by solid acidity. Nectarine, melon and apple are standard-issue flavors, while the finish is mild and fleshy in feel.
Aromas convey cedar, savory herb, earth, black licorice and cherry. The dark flavors are reserved in style but still display richness, supported by fine-grained tannins.
Rose, eucalyptus, espresso and exotic spice aromas lead into a linear, structured palate offering sour cherry, pomegranate star anise and roasted coffee flavors in this wine. Close-grained tannins leave a firm, tight finish. Drink 2023–2033.
With just the merest hint of rosé color, this beautifully dry wine has delicious acidity, refreshing red berry fruits as well as a fine depth of ripe fruit flavors. It tastes young, and would benefit from a few months more in bottle.
Huge black-fruit intensity rushes to the nose and gives this wine a sun-drenched, jammy feel that is soft, but not necessarily sweet. In fact, this ripe Primitivo shows balance and a touch of refreshing acidity.
Winemaker: Louis Strydom. This Cabernet Sauvignon-dominant blend, with 30% Shiraz and 10% Merlot, opens with a lovely mélange of just-ripe aromas of blackberry, cassis and black plum, laced with notes of licorice, blackcurrant leaf and toasted whole spice. The mouthfeel is robust and full, with assertive tannins that lend a firm structure and perfectly frame the ripe black-fruit flavors. Flavors of plum skin, wood spice and bittersweet cocoa hang on endlessly to the finish. It's delicious now, but still a baby, with plenty of maturing and evolution ahead; try after 2020 and through 2026.
The clean, brisk mouthfeel gives this slightly oaked Sauvignon Blanc instant likeability. It's dry with a rich streak of honey that sweetens the citrus, pear and tropical fruit flavors. Pair this with Asian fare, ham or a green salad with grapefruit sections.
Hot gravel, fresh mint, dried basil and dark red fruits entertain the nose on this bottling of 44% Cabernet Sauvignon, 43% Cabernet Franc and 13% Merlot from the Frankel Family Estate. Playful red fruits make for easy drinking, with complexity coming from licorice and a buttered finish.
Wild berry, fragrant blue flowers, pipe tobacco and sun-baked earth aromas come together in the glass. It's bright, with notes of clove, white pepper and tobacco adding interest to the black cherry core. Lithe tannins and fresh acidity support the juicy flavors.
Big, structured tannins lie over the ripe fruit. The wine has a dense character, the young tannins dominant. Given a year, the fine fruit will come through to give a sweeter blackberry character.
Touches of smoke and grain extend throughout this uniquely savory off-dry kabinett. Rich streaks of peach and marmalade brighten the palate, accented by bursts of lemonade acidity, but overall, there's a bit of disarray throughout.
Cool, crisp and tonic from start to finish, this is an easy-drinking wine with ample sweet apple and wildflower notes, with shades of smoke, hazelnut skins and delicate lime-juice acidity. Drink now.

Citrus and apple aromas are straightforward. This feels mostly good on the palate, with some flab and grab. Citric-leaning flavors of grapefruit and orange are softened by nectarine notes, while the finish is clampy like the palate.
Initial aromas are suggestive of turpentine and alcohol, but with time things improve. This is chunky and low on pulse; flavors of tomato, green herbs and red fruits are marginal, while the finish carries some burn and heat.
Mostly Merlot (51%) and Cabernet Franc (40%), rounded out by Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot, this wine opens with aromas of black cherry and dark fruit alongside floral and barrel--spice accents. The palate is focused and layered, bringing waves of fruit flavors supported by enough structure to go the distance.
Polished cherry, blackberry and coffee fruit flavors comprise this Merlot. It's bone dry, with rich tannins and a smattering of oak. Has a jagged quality that's not likely to age out, but it's a pretty good wine.
Sensational wine for the money. The Cab and Merlot work together seamlessly, as the nose exudes raspberry and sweet leather. Tastes warm and toasty, with ripe fruit softened by chocolate and pillowy tannins. Argentine red at its affordable best.
This is a lovely bottle, sourced from the eastern Yakima Valley. It's a classic Washington take on Malbec, 100% varietal, with bright and crisp flavors of tart berry, hints of baking spice, plenty of acid but a pleasing softness to the tannins. The lightly leafy, herbal character of the grape shines through, making this a consummate food wine, finished at a pleasing 13.4% alcohol.
Too sharp in acids, giving the cherry and raspberry flavors a real bite. Almost sour on the finish. Drink now.
All about fruit, this is a ready-to-drink Port, although it could also age. Red fruits and dried raisins are lifted by the intense acidity as well as the tannic structure, producing a wine that is on the dry side for Port. Because it is not filtered, the wine will throw a sediment; however, that also means that the wine could age, although it is delicious, ripe and fruity now.
When a producer renowned for its red wines can turn out an elegant, understated white of this quality, you know Australian Chardonnay has firmly arrived. Subtle accents of toasted nuts frame citrusy fruit, and while the wine is full-bodied and round in the mouth, it remains focused and long and on the finish. If you're fortunate enough to get some of the 600 bottles imported, drink the wine over the next couple of years.

Here's a savory blend of Sangiovese, Sagrantino, Cabernet and Merlot that delivers ripe red cherry, white and black pepper, with a hint of orange peel. It's still very tannic, and finishes and on a note of espresso. Drink 2015–2020.

This tastes bone dry, with a caramel note that's followed by light, bright notes of red berry and apple. The finish is crisp and tight.
A solid producer of Naoussa, Karydas has crafted a good Xinomavro  with this vintage. Aromas come on strong with lush purple fruit, violets, pepper and menthol, then pick up lemon, charred burger and distinctive earthy elements. Flavors of pomegranate, menthol and plum all have a meaty feel, while hard tannins are matched by firm acidity. More of a curiosity wine than one to consume over light conversation.
Lip-smacking is an inelegant yet apt word to describe the unctuousness of this nectar of honey, saffron and marmalade. It's delightfully rich and creamy, yet gorgeously balanced, seared by a razor's edge of lemon-lime acidity. It's an exceptional wine now, penetrating and persistent, but will surely delight for decades to come.
Spicy, new wood aromas dominate this firm and structured wine. It has weight and a density that comes both from the wood and ripe fruits. Big and solid, it has a fine red berry aftertaste.

Asparagus and green-herb aromas run smoothly into grapefruit, passion-fruit and sweet green-pea flavors. More citrus fruits emerge on the tart, cleansing finish.
The aromas of dried flowers and green herbs have yet to fully blossom, seeming light and elusive, with green pepper providing accents. The blackberry and black currant flavors are light and layered, with well-balanced tannins and an extended finish.

From the head winemaker at Zaca Mesa, a phenomenal wine from this top vineyard. Easily one of the best California Pinot Blancs I've ever tasted. It's rich and honeyed, almost decadent in marzipan flavors, but richly dry, with a wonderful streak of acidity. Try as an alternative to a top Chard.

Valentina Cubi is a quality Amarone producer to look out for especially if you like big and brawny wines with skyscraping intensity.

The 2001 is the youngest and boasts nutty spice, poached apple and pure integrity of fruit with firm tannins and long cherry flavors on the finish.
Herbal notes mingle with aromas of kirsch, violet, tobacco and tanned hide. Sweet spice and pepper unfold on the palate, integrating seamlessly with the black fruit flavors. The structure is firm but not too tough or unapproachable now, with medium acidity and a long, lingering finish.
The best of the 2006 McKinley Springs reds, this overcomes a fairly heavy dose of vanilla-flavored oak and moves into mixed cherry, plum, mocha, coffee and spice. The barrel regimen is a bit much for the pretty fruit, but there is a good base for future improvement.
You'll find lovely, complex flavors of raspberries, cherries, red currants, spices and smoky vanilla notes from oak in this dry, pleasant wine. It's also very tart, biting into the palate with a cut of acidity, which seems to be a trait of the vintage. Good now, if a little direct.
This is relatively light, with straightforward fruit aromas, flavors of pomegranate and strawberry, and a smooth, soft texture.
There is some extraction here, giving a dry character to this wine, but it also has enough berry flavor to act as a balance. This wine has a promising future but demands a few years to age. Drink from 2015.
Huge and rich, this offers ripe black fruits and a concentrated structure. It's packed with a seemingly sweet blackberry flavor that serves as a counterpoint to the firm texture. With both density and a dark edge, this will age over several years.
The musky touch of botrytized fruit appears immediately, adding even more allure to the golden color. An explosion of golden apricot and luscious peach provide mouthfilling sweetness on the palate. All this is countered by very concentrated lemon freshness. This is not one of the tooth-achingly sweet SGNs—this is fresher and still has vivid fruit flavors. The finish has so much freshness it is lip-smacking. This will be a killer with fruit-centered desserts. Its sweetness-acid balance is of utter poise and a wonderful class act. Drink 2017–2050.
There is an almost tropical touch to the apple and lemon fruit: this is almost like vanilla-spiced apple tart with lemon zest. Very appetizing with that unusual vanilla-edge and more of that tropical lychee. Overall, this is balanced and very fruit-driven.
Here's a pretty Barbera d'Alba with cheerful aromas of blackberry, sweet spice and cinnamon. The wine is soft, round and smooth and that touch of sweetness on the close makes it a good candidate for roast tomatoes with chèvre chaud.
The aromas are quite reticent, with notes of herb, purple fruit and abundant wood spices. Still, the palate delivers plush-feeling fruit flavors, speckled with attractive barrel accents.
Strong berry aromas come with ample leather, earth and tobacco accents. The palate is tough and tight, but loaded with powerful, earthy flavors of black fruit, mineral and a can't-miss briny, salty element. It's aggressive, savory and potent on the finish. This needs food or a couple of years more aging.
Intense acidity gives this wine character. It is taut and nervy, with a mineral texture. The bright, crisp red-fruit background to this acidity will assert itself over the coming months. Drink from late summer 2017.
An attractive entry level Port, fruity with a light tannic structure and a sweet character. Blackberry jam dominates the fruit flavor of this everyday Port.
This Sangiovese is deeply concentrated, redolent of raw blueberry, simple red fruit, spice, leather and perfumed candle. The sour cherry notes on the finish add a tart, crisp point on the tail end of this wine.
A real surprise! Who in their right mind could expect so much quality from a Cab Franc-Tempranillo blend from Penedès? But try it and we guarantee you're going to like it.

Not much going on with this thin, watery wine. It's dry and tart, with a splash of citrus flavor.
From a section of the vineyard planted to only one clone, Paige's is luscious and velvety, smoothly decadent in sanguine, tangy fruit. Full bodied and in balance, it suggests a wild note of mint or bay leaf, something savory as one would find in a cassoulet or beef stew, two things with which it would pair well.
Mouth-watering scents of Old Bay and black cherries emerge from the glass, but the palate does't quite live up to the early promise. It's ample in weight and well balanced by acidity, yet the black cherry fruit seems a bit simple and turns drying on the finish. Give it until 2015 or so and see if it comes around.
Donum is at the top of it's Pinot Noir game. This is simply wonderful, offering a wealth of red fruit, cola, spice, mineral and earth flavors.

Extra Dry is almost indistinguishable from its Brut; not noticeably sweet. But there is a somewhat soft quality that mars the finish.
Shows some rustic spicy and herbal notes, along with strawberry and herbal tea flavors. Light in body, and a bit tart and tannic on the finish, this lacks the generosity shown by the other 2004 reds in the lineup.
A great mouthful of rich sweetness, toffee rounding an already velvet texture. The wine, with its liquid honey and mango flavors, feels full-bodied. If balancing acidity is less apparent, it does show in the fresh, lifted finish. Screwcap.
This is a smooth, easy-drinking and rather light-bodied wine, not unusual in the tricky vintage of 2011.

The texture is almost delicate but livened up with a good touch of acidity.
Made entirely with Nero d'Avola, this offers aromas of black-skinned fruit, tilled earth and cake spice. The concentrated but also focused palate shows ripe black cherry and crushed raspberry while nutmeg and carob add depth. Lithe tannins and lively acidity provide the framework.

This is the winery's Merlot-driven second wine, generally composed of barrels not used in the flagship Chaleur Estate.

Cedar, lead pencil and black fruits suggest its pedigreed sibling. Very tannic, earthy and substantial compared with previous vintages of D2.

From 100% Pinot Noir given extra time en tirage, this is part of Sumac's top-tier Pinnacle series. Made only in the best vintages (2000 was the winery's 25th anniversary), it is a rosé in style if not in name, with rich toasty flavors and good grip throughout.

This famous vineyard in Calistoga always produces red wines with gigantic, hard tannins, and so it is with this '09 Cab. It's so astringent that it's not drinkable now.

Made entirely with Garganega, this offers aromas of maple syrup, pressed white flower and candied orange zest. The round palate doles out dried apricot and tangerine while a hint of orange blossom honey backs up the finish.
There's an overripe taste to this wine, suggesting raisin and prune, and it has high alcohol. Although it's dry and rich in tannins and oak, its rustic quality makes it difficult to enjoy.
A finely balanced wine that shows structure as well as rich fruits. It has ripe red fruits, spice and toast that hang well together, the fruit held in check by the structure of the wine. This would be worth aging for two years or more.
This limited-production, aged wine incorporates 8% Merlot, sourcing grapes from several vineyards across the Napa Valley.

Pinot Gris has been a Lange highlight since the winery was founded in 1987. Fermented in neutral puncheons, this is a distinctive, focused wine, with pretty pear, spicy apple and a touch of citrus. The puncheons add a light hint of vanilla cookie.

Strong in gooseberry flavors that are unripe, with those notoriously green, sour feline elements. Despite some citrus and apple flavors, it's a hard wine to warm up to.

Tannins provide a sturdy architecture, but they're ripe and accessible.
Initial aromas are floral, candied and medicinal, but with time the nose rounds into form. The palate has a grabby, simple feel to it, while flavors of red plum and cherry have a lactic aftertaste. This is a generic Priorat, but it seems to get better the longer it sits in the glass. Drink now, but give it as much airing as possible.

Aromatic and loaded with sweet blackberry fruit, backed with black olive and clean earth, this polished effort shows excellent midpalate concentration and a nicely sculpted finish.
Powerfully oaked but awkward, with bruising aromas of fresh-cut wood, sawdust and campfire smoke. Amid the woodiness and thick body you'll find roasted plum and berry flavors, but on the finish resin reappears and lingers. Tastes too saucy and resiny to be called “clean.”
The winemaker aged a majority of this wine on the lees in new French oak, and the rest in stainless steel. This combination is easygoing and very fruity in aroma and flavor. The body is medium while the texture is soft and agreeable.
A fresh, clean, very green wine, which has delicious crisp fruit flavors. It seems to dance on the point of a needle in its fine, delicate flavors and very mineral character. Imported by Bayfield Importing Ltd.
An eccentric Chardonnay. It's certainly not shy, offering a blast of pineapple, Meyer lemon and Asian pear fruit flavors, brightened with good acidity and elaborated with oak. The trick with this kind of Chardonnay is to make it finish dry. This one doesn't.
Intensely crisp and perfumed, this is a green-fruit flavored wine. Its tangy character is reinforced by a mineral texture. The wine needs another six months, so drink from 2018.

A broad, ripe wine, with peach and apricot flavors to go with a fine citrus tang. Full in the mouth, very fruity and attractively textured with green plum skin juiciness.

Light raspberry fruit carries a suggestion of clean earth and dried herb. The tannins show some substantial grip. The overall balance is fine, though the wine drinks younger than most 2012s. Best after 2020.

Heady aromas suggest cinnamon and clove wrapped around black cherry and chocolate. Silky on the palate, it's structured in juicy red fruit and black licorice, lingering on the balanced finish.
Showing sweet toasty oak, brisk acidity and pure flavors of citrus fruit and apricot, this is a very rich, dry Chardonnay, although all of its parts haven't quite come together. While it's not an ager, it will benefit from holding until mid-2013, but not any longer.
The nose is rather closed but this bursts into life in the mouth with lip-smacking citrus freshness and notions of tart stone fruit along a linear, driven palate. Whistle-clean and just a little bracing, this is a textbook Riesling from the fresh 2014 vintage. It's light-bodied but shows lots of verve.
Overtly grapey aromas are joined by scents of fresh weed-whacker trimmings. Seems very soft in the mouth, with sour notes of camphor and toast joining in on the palate. Finishes short. Try slightly chilled, as you would a Beaujolais nouveau.
Seductively light in color, this is based on Pinot Noir. It has a fine balance and a touch of toast. The fresh red-fruit and citrus flavors harmonize into a complex whole. Like many Bollinger Champagnes, it's a delicious, full-bodied selection that's best suited for food.
This is a wine for anyone who longs for an old fashioned Barbara. An interesting, funky  and very complex nose of menthol, wet fur, coffee, and strawberries. On the palate, it seemed surprisingly soft (one would have expected more acidity) and the flavors less funky than the nose, with a core of sweet strawberry fruit at the finish.

The vineyard is in the interior part of the appellation, toward Carneros, and the wine displays the firm, acidic minerality of that cool, foggy region. It has fantastic limpidity. The oak is remarkable for the purity of vanilla and smoky honey, while the underlying flavors of Meyer lemons, pineapples, nectarines and kumquats are decadently good. A masterpiece of Chardonnay.

Round and ripe, with woody hints, a note of bramble patch and plenty of saturated red fruit. Flavors of plum, berry, pepper and espresso drive the palate, followed by light oak and butter on the finish. Well structured and well made, it's another fine super Tuscan from the top-shelf 1999 vintage.

With its sweet wood, dense fruit and jammy character, this is a rich wine. It has some solid tannins, but they are almost lost in the welter of soft strawberry, nutmeg and juicy red berries.

Big in flavor, with a touch of ripely rounded heat, this wine dances in coconut and black olive flavors, a sweet savoriness that's enhanced by cedar and pencil seasonings. The finish comes with a bittersweet taste of tobacco.

At first the lick of oak-derived vanilla overlays the fruit but then aromatic notes of ripe red currant and red cherry appear. The palate is silky and offers exciting snatches of white pepper and welcome earthiness. The body is light but full of subtlety. It is white pepper rather than oaky spice that lingers.
Cassis spritzer and pine tree-like herbals provide a promising start on the nose. It's rich in the mouth, with cherry, blackberry and a nice edge of black pepper.
Gentle scents of perfume, wild berry and cedar blend seamlessly on the nose. The palate is more punchy and tight, with heavy extraction creating narrow flavors of blackberry and cassis. A short, sinewy finish limits the wine's breadth.
This lively sparkler has played an important role in making Prosecco one of the most popular wines in the United States. Its a textbook rendition, with peach nectar, tangerine and a soft, creamy finish.

Aromas of black currant, licorice, plum and dried herb are followed by elegant flavors. The tannins show a touch of dryness.
This is a tremendous young wine, enormous in fruity stuffing. It's fairly tannic, but the Grenache-like cherry, cassis, plum and fudgy chocolate flavors are so powerful, so evocative, nothing could mask them. Grilled steak will tame it, but this is a good cellar candidate to open between 2008 and 2015. You can also decant for a few hours.

This almost colorless sweet wine is made from Macabeo, not your most expressive grape variety. Aromas are funky and cheesy, with a low-acid palate that's on the flabby side, while creamy vanilla and caramel flavors don't allow for much fruit to shine through.
Kestrel remains one of the most enigmatic Washington wineries; brilliant at times, disappointing at others, possessed of excellent old-vine fruit and yet plagued with inconsistency. This Co-ferment Syrah was excellent in 2002 and even better in 2003, but falls a bit short in 2004. It's got the purple-black color but not the density to match; the fruit flavors are chewy and tart, and the wine has an acidic edge that leaves an impression of unripeness.
Maple, brown sugar, caramel and cinnamon powder aromas portend sweetness. In the mouth, this is fairly heavy and syrupy, with moderate acidity. Caramel and mushroom flavors finish fragmented but with potency.
Just what you want in a Sauvignon Blanc-based white Bordeaux-style wine. It's bone dry and mouthwateringly tart in acidity, while the citrus flavors suggest gooseberries, but don't fall into the trap of green underripeness. Sémillon constitutes 20% of the blend.
Easy-drinking and straightforward, this approachable Pinot offers bright notes of red cherry, blueberry and strawberry framed by dusty tannins and a softly herbal finish.

This shows toasty, petrol richness, but has preserved much of its original freshness, leaving a good few years' potential.
This wine starts with aromas that recall farmyard and wet fur; these burn off to reveal leafy underbrush and forest floor. The palate offers dried cherry, blackberry, fennel, tobacco leaf, oak and fennel. It closes on a jumbled note of sugary vanilla and bitterly astringent tannins.
This is a welcome return for this value Merlot after the 2004 vintage was skipped. The smooth and chocolaty flavors that consumers love are there, but they have been pulled back, letting more of the cherry fruit and subtle accents of forest floor, fungus and earth show through. It's textural, complex and thoroughly enjoyable.
Dark berries or plums, cedar and spice notes sum up the aromas and flavors you can expect from this Heathcote Shiraz. It's medium to full in body, and while it's not overly lush, neither is it overly lean—making it a balanced drink with moderate complexity. The firm finish suggests cellaring another year or two, or pairing it with grilled or roasted meats.
Dark in color, this is a concentrated wine that's very firm in structure, with dense tannins. It's powered by ripe, mature black fruits as well as acids that cut through the dry texture. This needs several years of aging.

Light and crisp, this wine has a smooth apple flavor and soft acidity. It is fragrant and fruity, with some sweetness on the finish. It would make for a good apéritif.

Sweet and grapey, but with enough darkness and structure to rank. Blueberry and cherry aromas precede snappy cherry and raspberry fruit. Rock solid and ripe at the core, with no funk or green. What a bargain Chilean Merlot is supposed to be.

Additional hints of black pepper, licorice, dried herbs and mocha lend depth to the palate, while medium tannins lend ample structure but not too much grip through the close. Balanced and approachable, drink now–2021.

Good as far as it goes, but common, with ripe black cherry, cocoa and herb flavors, and oaky accents. Could be from anywhere. Drink now.
This is a lush, complex Pinot Noir. It shows classic cool-climate acidity and dryness, and long hangtime flavors of raspberries, cherries and cola. But there also are exotic notes of wild berries, spices, cured meats and dried herbs, which make the taste fascinating and elusive. The texture is silky and pure Pinot Noir. Should develop over the next 6–8 years.
This is a big-boned wine, showy in spearmint and eucalyptus, burly blackberry and tar. With integrated oak and tannin, it presents a respectable showing of approachably lush texture and succulence, the finish persistent in juicy fruit.

90—92 Barrel sample. Complex, this is a wine that is slashed through with fresh fruit, but that only enhance the dense tannins and solid structure. Yet it preserves a lightness and freshness.
This lightly toasty, vanilla-flavored wine shows good, light, tropical flavors. It opens well, with green plums and ripe fruit.
Edgy with mountainous berry flavor, Easton's 2010 Shenandoah Valley Zin is full-bodied, generous in savory spices and blackberry flavor and intoxicatingly aromatic with a peppery, leathery finish.

This blend of Syrah, Grenache and a few other varieties feels hot in the mouth, even though the alcohol is officially only 14.5%. It's thin and dry in jammy berry flavors.
93-95 Barrel sample. Richly smooth wine, with great polished fruits and solid tannins. Power and juicy extract.

Despite oak-infused pineapple and mango flavors this Chardonnay is a bit brittle and tart, with an acidic sharpness all the way through. Drink up.
This is one of Failla's riper, fruitier 2012 Pinots. Classic Sonoma Coast Pinot, with brisk acidity and complex flavors, it shows wild raspberry, cherry and blueberry fruits, persimmons, cola, and earthier notes of sautéed wild mushrooms and truffles. It's dry, tannic and tart, but as good as it is now, it will improve by resting until 2020.
Pretty good for this price, a balanced red wine, brimming with blackberry and cherry flavors, smoky oak, and the full-bodied richness you want in a Cab. Easy to find, with 76,000 cases produced.
A big, hugely rich, wood-dominated wine, oozing power and ripe fruit. This is almost Chard-like in its buttery weight, but is the usual Bordeaux blend of Sémillon and Sauvignon Blanc. Those who like power, line up here.

A perfectly simple, stainless-steel fermented Lake County SB with tangy lemon and lime notes, subtle at first. The finish falls off fast.
Barrel aromas are in the lead here, with notes of sawdust and cedar, along with Band Aid and gamy notes. Dark fruit aromas are in the background. The full-bodied flavors reveal more of the same, showing a lot of heat.
Brunello Assunto is a bright, balanced wine with simple aromas of wild berry, cherry and spice backed by a gritty, textured mouthfeel. The tannins are firmly tight and the crisp acidity suggest that this wine should age a few more years.
Light and frothy, this clean, palate-refreshing sparkler seems ideally suited to be an apéritif. Citrus and apple notes are gentle, underscored by some chalky minerality.
This aromatically unusual wine, with notes of cocoa and green herb, seems to show some oxidation. The purple fruit and orange-peel flavors are on the lighter side of medium bodied, pulling up on the finish.
Light lemon-lime and slight mineral aromas lead to standard apple, lime and orange-zest flavors. It's refreshing, easygoing, totally as expected and not the least bit disappointing, which is really what you're looking for from $10 Prosecco.
Roasted, woodsy, rubbery aromas are gamy and staunch, with berry notes interspersed. Grabby, rubbery tannins make for a rugged palate, while roasted plum and gamy flavors are a touch salty. A tannic finish doesn't change much.
Marked by passion fruit and pineapple, with a bit of honey included in the mix, this is beginning to broaden out and lose a little bit of its vitality yet still remains attractive. Drink this medium-bodied wine before the end of 2014.
Certainly intense, dominated by dry botrytis, with the syrup element here in texture rather than taste. The wine has a great tension between richness and intense acidity, a wine with a potential of 15 years aging or more, but for the moment an intense glass of wine.
This captures all the ripe fruit and fresh mouthfeel you could ask for in a young Riesling. Succulent and peachy, with references to other mixed tree fruits, this also brings highlights of orange pekoe tea. Residual sugar is 20 g/L.
An attractive pale, salmon-pink-colored wine, this is soft and ripe with strawberries and a smooth texture. Drink now.
Rubbery blackberry aromas are concentrated but blunt. This has a pinched, saucy feel that's related to high acidity. Saucy, rubbery flavors of blackberry show graphite and raw oak accents in front of an earthy, almost briny finish.
Deeply flavored, offering a flood of ripe blackberry and black cherry fruit, liberally enhanced with sweet, smoky oak. The tannins are rich and soft, and acidity is brisk. Immature now, and needs time. Give it a good five years and see what happens.
Smells good, with berry- dominated aromas. The palate is solid but acidic at the core, with sharpness on the palate that creates a juicy, crisp set of raspberry and plum flavors. Flattens out on the finish, where moderate oak-based butter notes rise up.
These are still young vines, and showing rather simple, though attractive, fruit flavors of raspberry, strawberry and red currant. Vague hints of pepper and rock suggest good things to come, but for now this is a bit of an underachiever for the price.
Tobacco box and cedar notes lend savory nuances to this stately, but slightly subdued Cabernet Sauvignon. Delicate black plum and cherry flavors are crisp and cool, fringed by soft fine tannins. Drink now through 2018.
Light and fresh smells of Key-lime pie, grapefruit rinds and ripe nectarine show on the nose of this versatile bottling from the veteran San Jose-based winery. The grippy, assertive flavors are bright, tight and pithy, with lime rinds, kumquat tang and chalky minerality, proving refreshingly sour.
Brambly blackberry and leathery tar make for a full-bodied atmosphere around what is actually a fairly light, integrated and smooth wine. Clove and black currant give the finish a spicy edge.
The aroma recalls ripe, juicy pear peel. Likewise, the palate sings with ripe pear notes, framed by a phenolic texture and countered by lively freshness. This wine is brisk, clean and fruity.
Ripe pineapple, apricot and honey aromas presage a full-bodied, ripe wine. The melon and stone fruit flavors are broad and soft, lingering on the finish despite relatively low acidity. Drink now.
Black tea leaves and sweet spices season the fresh black-cherry and cassis spine of this attractive red blend. A good grip in the mouth lends structure to the fruit-forward palate and gives longevity to the dry finish.
Classic Howell Mountain Cabernet. The fruit is intense and concentrated in black currants and cocoa, the tannins are strong and hard, the acidity is perfect, the finish is entirely dry, and there's a firm minerality. So deliciously elegant now, it's hard to resist, but this Cab will surely reward cellaring through at least 2017.
Felton Road's Pinots have been among the best in NZ, but the 2007s step things up another notch. The Block 3 combines a briary, slightly herbal element with black cherry aromas, then unfolds on the palate to reveal layers of fruit, coffee and spice. It's lush yet structured, with a long, textured finish. Drink now–2015.
From the hot 2003 vinatge, this is a bold, chewy expression of Amarone with deep layers of mature fruit and cherry. It delivers plush background notes of cinnamon, leather, chocolate and smoked cedar wood as well.
It's a midnight-black wine, full-bodied and tannic, with immense black currant, grilled meat and black pepper flavors that finish bone dry. Already throwing some sediment, it will live for two decades, without gaining in complexity. Drink now–2025.
Finely balanced, simple Sauternes with light apricot and honey flavors. With just a touch of botrytis dryness, the aftertaste is more sweet.
The lime, kiwi, orange and lemon fruit flavors are so delicious, you won't miss the oak accents at all. Its bright, vital acidity makes it shine like polished silver. This is a very good food win at a reasonable price. With 20,000 cases produced, it should be relatively easy to find.
Shadings of menthol and anise add a spicy character to the fruit-forward notes of strawberry, rhubarb and currant on the nose and palate. The tannins are soft and approachable, with clean yet fleeting flavors of red-fruit skins. Drink now.
Notes of thyme, cocoa and broad dark fruit lead to a malleable, medium-full palate. The finish conveys tang and iron.
This fiery Grenache delivers heat, bold fruit and cured meat aromas on what amounts to a flaming bouquet. Red fruit flavors dominate this forceful wine, while the finish turns meaty and salty tasting.
Dilute yet raisiny aromas struggle to stir interest. This wine feels wide and flat on the palate, with no real focal point. Chunky, slightly bitter flavors of apple skins and wood spice finish with a blast of oaky clove.
One of a range of single-vineyard wines, this is a selection from the producer's oldest vines. It has great white fruit, and is generously textured and ripe. Hints of yellow fruit in the background add richness. It has a soft aftertaste, suggesting it is ready to drink.
Séguret wines often have a firmness to their tannins, and this is no exception. Attractive notes of red cherries, dusty earth and garrigue are framed by starching tannins, which leave the finish spicy and drying. Drink it now with fatty red meats, or give it a couple of years in the cellar to mellow.
Delicate pear, honeydew melon and hay aromas lead the way. The linear, elegant palate offers yellow apple, fresh herb and citrus zest alongside crisp acidity. A mineral note further brightens the finish.
This wine is a blend of several vineyard designates for the producer, including Campbell Ranch and Baranoff. It's pretty and floral, its aromatics an inviting mix of cinnamon-clove and cherry-plum. Exotically spiced in cardamom, it offers a tangy texture and lingering bite of oak on the finish.

This 100% Zin erupts in briary, peppery wild raspberry, blueberry and cherry flavors. The tannins are firm, and the acids crisp and savory. What a lovely Zinfandel, made in the soft, velvety style of Merlot, but with Bradford Mountain power.
Off-dry, with sugary flavors of pineapples, lemons, limes and honeysuckle flowers. Good acidity keeps the finish clean.
Inky oaky aromas of graphite and black fruits introduce a palate that's supremely saturated. Flavors of roasted plum and blackberry are savory and meaty, while this feels lush on the finish but also strapping and sinewy. Dos Mundos purports to represent both Portugal and Argentina, but this is all Argentina in character. Drink through 2023.
Brilliant golden hay in color, this is a dry, intense sparkler, made from 75% Chardonnay and 25% Pinot Gris. It offers complex highlights of lemon and apple on the palate with plenty of minerality.
This light, bright and remarkably floral white from the Musqué clone impresses in its balance and lingering mouthfeel. Subtle flavors of nectarine and peach invite one in and become more pronounced in the glass over time, providing refreshment and elegance.
As in 2009, the 2010 Bully includes 10% Petit Verdot, and was aged in 100% new French oak.

Give it aerating and it shows plenty of depth, with dense raspberry fruit, notes of white pepper and crushed rock, and a lively streak of lemony acid.
There's a savory, slightly demure quality to this elegant Pinot Noir. The palate is not deeply concentrated, but crisp black cherry and plum flavors are shaded by tones of granite and dried herbs. Persistent, fine-grained tannins mark a moderate finish.
Aromas of maraschino cherry, medicine cabinet, Band-Aid and leather on this 100% varietal wine are followed by slightly dried-out-seeming fruit flavors. Smoke flavors persist on the finish, but the wine presents a sense of elegance.

This 50% Merlot, 50% Cabernet Franc has been barrel aged for 22 months, resulting in a fruity nose of cranberry, cherry and plum and flavors of red fruit, pepper and spice. A touch angular, but food will soften the edge. Overall a good, assertive red for everyday enjoyment.
This is an unusual blend of Columbard, Sémillon, Chenin Blanc and Chardonnay, and it's a nicely crisp white with plenty of fruity flavors that finishes dry. Easy to drink with Asian fare.
This ripe, full-bodied wine has ripe green fruits that are lifted by lime and made richer by apricot.

Drink from 2017.
Ripe, jammy, berry flavors are fruity, with a roasted overtone. This feels round, rubbery and fresh, while broad berry flavors include hints of herbs but not much in the way of minerality or nuance. An extracted, slightly tannic finish is weighty and smooth, but ordinary.
There is a definite touch of stalkiness here, perhaps a consequence of the vintage. It has black currant fruits and balanced acidity, needing a few more months to be developed. Drink from 2016.
A little light in body and flavor, with dried Provençal herb flavors and a hint of cherry. Does a yeoman's job of expressing basic Santa Rita Pinot Noir character at a price that's about half that of the top bottlings.
A new wine for this winery, this comes from declassified barrels from its other programs. This blend of Merlot (36%), Syrah (26%), Cabernet Sauvignon (23%) and Petit Verdot delivers a whole lot of immediate appeal with its notes of smoke, char, black currant, huckleberry and plum. The flavors are full and lush with a creamy, supple feel and soft tannins.
This has intriguing aromas of marzipan and white cherry, plus touches of apple and mineral. A medium-bodied wine, it offers acidity that becomes mouth-puckering on the finish. Pair this with some goat cheese to help tame the tartness.
This wine is spicy, fruity and packed with herbal and lemon flavors. It will soon be a refreshing wine, lively and with swathes of acidity. Drink from late summer 2017.
Harmonious aromas of cassis, vanilla and mocha are inviting. The palate, however, seems narrow and high in acidity; it's grinding and choppy, with herbal, tangy flavors of berry and cassis mixed with tobacco and herbs. Finishes rough and scratchy, with a lasting olive flavor. A very good wine but not the best Le Dix by any means.
A clear color and agile, minerally aromas of pear and apple announce that this is mild and not too pushy. Elegant and fresh on the palate, this Verdejo tastes of orange, grapefruit and mango, while the finish is lasting and focused.
There's a creamy, full quality to this wine that is backed by aromas of mature peach, yellow flower and honey. It has an easy approach and would pair well with salmon or swordfish carpaccio.
When Aveleda's Guedes family purchased Quinta da Agueira, it came with its own grand house, a 19th century folly (a great term in the British lexicon). So, being fans of follies, the family named this spicy wine after the house. This wine is dense and concentrated, with dark fruit balanced by structured tannins. Drink now–2022.
Strong in flavor and smooth in the mouth, this soft, juicy Syrah is like velvet made of blackberries, blueberries and chocolate. It is, in a word, delicious, and while it's somewhat sweet, the acidity and minerality balance it.
Sweet peach nectar and fragrant white flower open the nose of this lush Gewürztraminer. The wine feels slightly sweet and sticky on the palate with rich density and a waxy finish.

The wine is structured and with intense acidity and a tight texture. A mineral character goes through the wine, contrasting with the red fruit. It is a serious wine that will repay aging, so drink from 2018. This organic vineyard is switching to biodynamic.
Shows some wonderful botrytis aromas of dried apricots, but also a disturbing amount of volatile acidity. If you can tolerate notes of shoe polish and nail polish, you may find this rating woefully conservative.
A very uncommon California version of a grape originally from Southern France, this shows broad and welcoming aromas of cranberry-raspberry juice, light purple flowers and cola. Served with a slight chill, it goes down easy, with plump plums and root-beer spice.
The nose shows black cherry, cherry cola, eucalyptus and toasty cedar. Brambly and leafy flavors open themselves to more cherry and eucalyptus on the palate and an enjoyably long and smokey finish.
High acidity marks this wine, giving it a crisp character with subdued fruitiness. That should change over the next few months, so drink from late 2017.
This is a pretty Pinot Bianco from Alto Adige (the extreme north of Italy) with fragrant aromas of green melon, white flowers and peach. The wine doles out delicate flavors in the mouth and boasts good persistency and staying power.
Light cherry-red in color, this nuanced Pinot is bright in raspberry and tart grenadine, floral, with a spicy undercurrent of garden herb. Easy to like and approachable it's well-priced, high-quality and elegantly balanced.
An earthy wine that has red berry fruits and acidity alongside a rustic barnyard character. There is a mineral edge to the wine as well, so maybe giving it a year will help.
Yeasty aromas of banana and white bread feed into a round full palate that's not at all edgy despite this being brut nature. Bready, yeasty flavors of citrus and nectarine end with a flash of peach and excellent clarity, length and elegance. Both this and AA's Privat Mirgin prove that elevated Cava can compete with the world's best sparkling wines.
Modest, dry dark fruit flavors struggle for presence in this opaque, toasty-oak-veiled red. Medium-full in weight, it's even in texture and has some length. But the overoaking is intense and it's doubtful the fruit will ever have a major role in this play.
Pungent and stiff, but clearly it's Sauvignon Blanc. The palate is a pure citric wash of tight lime, lemon and cucumber flavors. Turns toward crisp tangerine on the finish. Lean and bright in style.
Nice Albariño, no ifs, ands or buts. The nose is floral and clean, and that's backed by a no-fuss palate of citrus, namely orange and grapefruit. As it holds form from front to back, you know this is a good wine. Will go great with light salads and shellfish. Drink immediately.
Rubbery and rhubarby on the nose, then confected and frankly sweet-tasting on the palate, with a short finish.
Mainly melon and fig here, without the green notes or pungency that New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc has become so noted for. It's a pleasant, medium-bodied white that should prove versatile at the table for just that reason.
Dineen vineyard fruit contributes ripe flavors of blueberry and black cherry, yet retains the peppery, herbal scents and flavors of Yakima Valley Syrah. It's front-loaded for flavor, complex at first taste. The follow-through turns slightly minty, with acids tasting of lemon zest and pineapple, giving it a sharp and precise finish.
Dry wine, with bitter almond and final grapefruit flavors over a base of tight, smoky acidity. The wine is ripe, nutty in character. on the way to closing up for 2–3 years.
Pomele is a sweet red wine made from the Aleatico grape that could pair with salty and sweet foods. The wine offers bright tones of black cherry, blackberry and a touch of exotic spice.
Intriguingly complex aromas of plum, herb and game don't quite follow through on the palate, where the fruit becomes more dominant, delivering superripe blackberry flavors. Mouthfeel is round and soft but not unstructured; drink now or hold 2–3 years. Imported by Kobrand.
95-97 Barrel sample. Big and ripe, a wine that showers you with ripe tannins, black plum and licorice flavors, and the most dusty tannins. An impressive and seriously concentrated wine.
Full-bodied, yet floral and velvety on the palate, this wine is sourced from the cooler southern parts of the appellation. Spicy and fruity in equal measure, it's balanced and elegant while offering lush texture around crisp red fruit.
This bright, aromatic, vivid wine opens with a bowlful of berries and cherries. There is plenty of acid under the ripe fruit, which takes center stage at the moment. The significant addition of Carmenère (from the Seven Hills vineyard) adds black pepper to the engaging mix of flavors. Despite its youth, the flavors persist for a remarkably long finish.
This broad, mouthfilling dry Riesling features powerful flavors of baked apple and dried spices, uplifted and amplified by oily, minerally accents. It's just a touch off-dry, balanced on the finish by crisp acids and pronounced minerality.
This is a lush wine, rich in fruit. It offers waves of cherries, blackberries, plums, cola, currants and licorice, and turns very spicy on the finish. Feels good and softly tannic and interesting in the mouth, with a fine bite of acidity. Seems best now and over the next 5–6 years.
This is a good, if somewhat soft and simple wine, with blackberry, cola and oak flavors. Structurally lean, the palate longs for something to grip onto and doesn't find it.
Very crisp, and loaded with tart green apples and lemons, this would be an ideal match for light fish or shellfish dishes. This is what unadulterated cool-climate Chardonnay tastes like.
This rounded, likable wine is integrated in oak and offers aromas of clarified butter, its fruitiness more tropical and stone fruit-driven than anything else. Concentrated, it finishes with simplicity.
For price and quality, Le Dix 2010 takes things to a high level. The nose on this Cabernet-led blend is full of violet, lilac, cassis and mild oak. The palate is multilayered and has a complex feel to it, while flavors of baked berry, cassis, coffee and marzipan finish with size and length. This is one of the most balanced and complete versions of Le Dix to date. Drink from 2014–2022.
I liked Cobblestone's regular Cab; at nearly half the price, it's better. Like that one, this is very ripe and rich in jammy blackberry, cassis, cherry and milk chocolate flavors, but seems oakier and riper, which intensifies the sweet flavors almost beyond table wine levels.
This 100% Sangiovese Chianti opens with iris, new leather and vanilla aromas. Structured and savory, the palate delivers black cherry, tobacco and licorice flavors, while chewy tannins lend structure. Enjoy through 2021.
Tropical fruit carries the bouquet, while the palate is citrusy and lively as it ranges from ripe grapefruit to pineapple and on to orange. Fresh on the tongue, with laudable balance and structure. Nothing outrageous but perfectly good.
Generous, sweetly perfumed aromas of melon and lemon oil lead into a wine with precision and penetration. Spicy, candied ginger complements the citrus and tropical fruit, and barrel fermentation gives it a gently buttery mouthfeel.
Big, fleshy and dark in color, with a bold, heavy nose of black fruits, baked richness and sweet characteristics. The palate is chunky and full, with blackberry, baked plum, fig and herbal flavors. A saturated, lusty style of Malbec that's deep like cake and just about as sweet.
A blend of Pinot Bianco, Friulano and Ribolla Gialla, this structured wine discloses aromas of white fragrant flowers and exotic fruit. The round palate offers yellow apple, pear, almond and vanilla with  a hint of toast.
This is quite a fine Zinfandel that shows the benefits of a relatively cool vintage in Paso Robles. The fruit is entirely ripe, but without the Porty sweetness that can mar Paso reds in a hot year. Although there's a caramelly edge, it's not over the top, lending a soupçon of honey to the blackberry and spice flavors.
Hailing from high-altitude Tupungato, this dense but fresh Malbec issues good plum, berry and earth aromas along with some smokiness and tree bark. It's fairly rich and full across the tongue, showing blackberry, blueberry and chocolate. Finishes warm and spicy, with good girth and weight.
A superior Syrah for its dryness, firm texture and restrained yet powerful flavors. Feels really fine in the mouth, with complex, rolling tannins that support waves of blackberry, bacon and sandalwood flavors, as well as something floral—violets, perhaps. Distinguished all the way through, it's fine for drinking now with foods like duck, game, steak or roasted chicken.
A partnership between growers Corinne and Charles Reichel and winemaking team Denis and May-Britt Malbec, this is a soft, round, oaked Cabernet Sauvignon that's blended with small amounts of Cabernet Franc and Malbec. It dances in blackberry, tobacco and chocolate, still chewy on the back of the palate.
This wine is soft and subdued, inviting in its full-bodied embrace of vanilla. With all five red Bordeaux varieties involved, it makes an impact, showcasing rich red berry, cassis and cherry, while a dusting of clove spice finds length on the finish.
Quite a good wine, rich, full-bodied and succulent. Shows a wealth of blackberry, red currant, licorice, bacon and black pepper flavors that finish with a touch of heat. The winery actually has lowered the price on this wine from previous vintages, which makes it a good value.
Rather soft and candied, with fruity-sweet flavors of cherries, raspberries, chocolate and cedar. Drink now–2010 for freshness.
A perfumed wine that shows delicious acidity, but also solid tannins. The wine is spiced with vanilla and nutmeg, then fruited with bright blackberry juice. The structure is in balance, with just the right amount of taut tannins.
A semisweet Vouvray, with its honey flavors still tasting very young. The acidity is all green apple, with freshness coming from the white currant edge. Lacheteau is a négociant, based in the Muscadet region.
The aromas of black currant, black cherry and plum announce this warm vintage wine. The flavors are plump and easy drinking, trailing slightly toward the finish.
While it is on the soft side, with sweetness, this Champagne also has an attractive lemon freshness to go with the vivid mousse. It's a fine apéritif style of Champagne.
This wine has a bright, crisp character that is reminiscent of Chablis. It has refreshing lemon and apple flavors, and it's ready to drink.
This wine is aromatically reserved with notes of milk chocolate, char, berry, barrel spices and high-toned herbs. It's silky and polished in feel, with richness and elegance to the coffee flavors.
Expensive, but aims for a Zinfandel touchdown and largely succeeds. With firm tannins and acids, it has explosive flavors of wild forest berries, currants, spices and oak that are complex enough to warrant a second, maybe even a third glass.
Good, deep flavors of blackberries, currants and spices mark this dry wine. It has a coating of smoky new oak. The texture is a bit harsh, which is really its only minus. Otherwise, it's a nice Merlot to drink now.
A first for Animale, and a terrific success, despite the almost 16% alcohol. Bursting with ripe berry flavors, this complex and flat-out delicious wine goes well beyond its highly-extracted black fruit. Wet rock, chalk and mineral extend and enhance the finish, with a chocolaty kiss at the very end.
A difficult wine to like, as it lacks charm. There's something rustic in the orange marmalade and sugared herb tea flavors that accentuates the tannins and acids, making the finish harsh.
An opulently ripe, wood-aged wine that's both fruity and textured. It has weight, richness, a lightly mineral texture with crisp apple and green plum flavors. Give this attractive while serious wine until the end of 2014.
Chianti's Castello Bossi owns this coastal Tuscany estate and has released a very attractive rosé with pretty floral tones, fresh fruit and a touch of menthol-cherry for extra dimension. Try it with pasta, fish or white meat.
King Estate makes several different versions of Pinot Gris, but this belongs at the very top, with pitch-perfect pear fruit at its core. Fresh, textural and brightly racy, it's an elegant and generous wine with a crisp, lingering finish that suggests it will continue to improve through 2020.
Herbal red-fruit aromas come across scratchy and suggestive of fresh field greens. The palate is tight and angular, with not much cushion and herbal-leaning flavors of currant and baked raspberry. This finishes herbal and warm tasting, a natural reflection of a hot year. Drink this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Carmenère now.
Here is a remarkable rarity. The Terrantez grape is the rarest of all the Madeira grapes and also produces the most long-lived wines with examples from the 18th century still drinkable. This much younger wine, with its old-gold color, is the epitome of that tension in some Madeira between sweetness and intense acidity. Lime marmalade and huge concentration mark out this very fine wine.
This wine is massively fruity and grandly structured without being heavy or overpowering, but it will need time for the firm tannins to mellow. It smells and tastes like pure, concentrated black cherry and feels full of fine-grained tannins and sour-cherry crispness. It will be best after 2020.
Subtle pepper and undergrowth notes play as strongly of a role as the gentle red currant fruit in this understated, lighter-bodied but spicy wine. Made in a very traditional vein, it is an unobtrusive, versatile red for lighter lunches where its pepperiness will score extra points.
Yellowish rather than pale in color, which indicates some overripeness that's confirmed on the chunky, apple-driven nose. Big on the palate as well, with tropical fruit preceding a lazy finish. Big in flavor but lacks touch. Imported by Cabernet Corporation.
Light and fresh, marked by flavors of pie cherries, cranberries and fresh herbs or grasses. Crisp and tart on the finish.
Smoked nuts and dusty minerals accent lemon and pink grapefruit notes in this off-dry, refreshingly brisk Riesling. Tart tangerine and white peach flavors are juicy on the palate, lingering into a finish that's softly astringent in tea-like tannins.
The draw for Cristalino has always been its crispness, but this bottling seems more thick and savory, with ham-like aromas and bulky lemon, orange and pineapple flavors. When this used to be $6 and simple we were all over it; but this is soft and tastes like the fruit you get at a buffet breakfast.
The stylish label puts this in the “bro” wine category, yet it's quite a good get for the price. Light aromas of crushed cherry candies, charred wood and fresh chopped mint drop into a palate laden with cherries and menthol. It's a nice, easy and not overpowering wine.
The latest release in this series of wines with its Belle Epoque bottle is, as always, a blend dominated by Chardonnay. So although the dosage is relatively high, that is balanced by fine acidity and minerality. It is a stylish wine, ripe and with the maturity to drink now.
This is a lovely wine, softly integrated and lean in muscle strength, with enviable complexity and length. Cedar, cranberry and currant are all represented, along a dusting of dried herbs and blackberry pie. This ripe, full-bodied wine never slips through the cracks, maintaining itself with grace under pressure.
89-91 Barrel sample. Ripe and juicy, with delicious blackcurrant flavors, the wine ripe, accessible and fruity. While it is not big, it is finely structured.
This wine has aromas of black berry, dried red raspberry and blueberry. In the mouth there are flavors of blueberry juice and black plum. The finish is slightly jammy yet persistent.
This has a strong steely, mineral character. It offers plenty of citrus and green plum but, at this young stage, the wine is more about crisp texture. The aftertaste hints at the future, ripe and warm. Drink from 2017.
From 53-year-old organic and biodynamically farmed Grenache vines, this elegant wine could easily age for 10 years but is drinkable now. Bursting with red cherries, strawberries, herbs, vanilla and violets, the palate's ultrafine tannins are backed by juicy fruit and a long, herbal, cranberry finish.
Ripe and sweet, this wine is full of generous red plums and berries. It is immediately attractive with its spice, structure and tannins playing a supporting role to the almost jammy fruit. Acidity at the end adds some attractive freshness to this ripe wine. Drink from 2020
Evidence of a warm vintage is sketched on the bouquet. Aromas of raisin, black licorice and mocha are quite sweet. The palate is wide and mildly tannic, with earthy, oaky black cherry and raspberry flavors. For a ripe wine with significant extraction, it's well balanced. But all along there's a hint of prune that tells you it's ripe and ready.
This blend of 45% Cabernet Franc, 44% Merlot and 11% Cabernet Sauvignon impresses with its accents of dried herbs, cherry and bittersweet chocolate. It's palate-coating in feel, with a dazzling sense of texture backed by fine-grained tannins.
The wine is spicy and laden with wood. It has an extracted character that produces chocolate and bitter coffee flavors. The fruit is hard to find at this stage.
This wine is distinctive, but not easy to cozy up to, with its dry, steely, lime and green apple aromas and flavors. On the finish, chalky, minerally notes seem almost tannic. A bit weird, but will have its fans. Imported by Cordon Selections.
Ripe and textured, this is a juicy, black-fruit-flavored wine. Power behind the fruit gives firmness and concentration. Acidity and berry fruits contrast with pepper and a bitter edge that needs to soften. Drink from 2019.
This concentrated but not overwhelming wine has charred-wood aromas and ripe, almost sweet blackberry and raspberry flavors. It's ripe enough to be syrupy, but doesn't go over the top.
This young Aglianico is still closed but the palate eventually reveals black plum and black cherry accented by notes of black pepper. It has a brooding character, with bracing tannins that leave a drying finish. Drink 2016–2022.
This is an oak aged wine that is trying too hard. It's only toast and juicy acidity from wood. It could possibly fill out with fruit although that is unlikely.
If this is the reserve, I'd hate to taste the regular. There's almost no fruit, with only a drop of citrus swimming in the alcohol and acidity.
Very pale, with a green tinge and aromas of vanilla, nectarine and lychee, this blend, (70% Roditis with Sauvignon Blanc and a touch of Gewürztraminer) is an enjoyable quaffing wine. You'll find citrus, orange and spice flavors accented by vanilla in this fine, balanced offering.
Mount Etna's Don Peppino vineyard is responsible for some of the volcano's most precious and highest quality fruit. This wine opens with a light hue and delicate aromas of violets, white almonds, cranberries and fresh plums. The nose is polished and refined. It's hard to believe that sucha violent volcano can produce such a feminine wine.
Nutty, oaky and tart, this stainless steel-fermented white shows a shock of acidity wrapped around freshly cut grass and tropical flavors.
Big. ripe and generous, showing some mineral character while also having concentrated apricot, peach and pineapple flavors, leavened with honey and layers of acidity. Like all fine Rieslings, this needs to age. Hold for at least four years.

At first it's quite dense and unyielding, but it opens slowly over a period of days—not hours—remaining dense and compact, with a remarkable array of dark fruits and barrel flavors. As with its companion reds from Quilceda Creek, this is a wine to cellar for decades.
A full-bodied wine, showing the richness and super-ripe grapes of 2003. It is soft, with dusty tannins showing through the ripe damsons and almost jammy character. It's all well in balance.
Fresh, crisp and tonic, this light and luminous wine made from Piedmont's Arneis white variety boasts pretty aromas of citrus and white mineral. The wine is fun and easy to drink, especially with summery appetizers.
Simple green-apple aromas are innocuous. This is fresh, easy and light on the palate. Flavors of apple and sweet greens finish mild and clean. Overall this wins by keeping things basic and fresh.
91-93 Barrel sample. Smooth wine, the tannins firmly placed within the ripe fruit. It is not heavy, only lightly extracted, full of the ripest fruit.
A Merlot and Malbec dominated Bordeaux-style blend with a splash of 7% Syrah added to the mix, it's lightly aromatic with notes of herbs, plum and blueberry. The fruit flavors are light in style, with quite firm tannins that need some time to unwind.
Cascades of fresh white grapefruit and pineapple take center stage in this invigorating dry Riesling. Nimble-footed and delicate in texture, it extends long on a rippling mineral undertone. Drink now through 2020.
A good, ripe Zinfandel that really needs food to wake it up. By itself, it's a little aloof, with firm tannins and acids hiding black currant, pepper and tobacco flavors. Better with cheeses, barbecue, pizza.
Here's a genuine and straightforward Barbera d'Alba with good quality of fruit (this wine is neither too dense or extracted) and ripe tones of cherry and raspberry. The mouthfeel is compact and firm. This is your quintessential pizza or pasta wine.
A selection from different parcels in the Château de Fuissé vineyard, this is a rich wine, initially soft, then showing a more textured character. It has weight, concentration, the wood adding another dimension to an already complex wine.
Too hot, with 15.6% alcohol, and it shows in the chile pepper heat. Also too soft, lacking structure. With the glycerine, it tastes like a sweet Starbucks drink with raspberry, mocha, vanilla and cinnamon flavors.
This refined, vibrant Pinot Bianco opens with floral aromas and apple scents. The juicy yellow apple carries over to the palate along with a refreshing citrus note and crisp acidity that gives a clean, quenching close.
Faiveley makes the most of the powerful tannins associated with Nuits-Saint-Georges. The dryness is blackberry tannins; the wood is kept in check. Full, concentrated, a powerful wine, needing aging.
It's a little late to be releasing an '04, but this may actually be all the better for the extra bottle age. Richly scented with rose petal soap, chewing gum and lychee, it delivers concentrated, oily flavors with a sharply floral streak. It's bone dry and highly extracted, and tips the scale at 14.4% alcohol.
This bright and nicely layered Chianti Classico opens with characteristic Sangiovese aromas of forest fruit and blue flower followed by leather and tobacco. Since the wine spends many months in oak, the finish is soft and spicy.
Bright and tonic, this cheerful Barbaresco delivers pretty aromas of perfumed spice, wild flowers, licorice and light shadings of talc powder. In the mouth, it offers an especially smooth and silky feel. Pair this elegant wine with lamb chops topped with crispy fried shallots.
An ever-so-slight astringency greets the nose on this 60% Rousanne-40% Viognier blend, with buttered apple and burned lemon aromas most prevalent. Apple leads the very even, almost subdued palate, perfect to pair with fruit salad to kick off a summer picnic.
Picked a bit soon due to an early freeze in 2009, this had plenty of sugar ripeness but lost a bit of the complexity that extra time on the vine can bring. Fruit forward with flavors of boysenberry and some brown sugar, this is a wine to enjoy while it's young and fresh.
Good price for a semidry blush wine, crisp and clean in acidity, with such rich fruit. The raspberries and cherries have a minerally component that adds structural elegance.
Another nicely made Viognier for this up-and-coming winery, the third in a row. Vivid acids define lemon drop fruit flavors. It's a clean, juicy style, with lip-smacking tartness and excellent focus in the midpalate. The finish is long and concentrated, with immaculately pure tasting fruit, and no alcoholic heat or excessive bitterness.
Tastes thin and metallic, with minerally lemon and lime citrus flavors. Partial barrel fermentation adds some creamy richness, but this is still a fairly lean Chardonnay.
Nearly all Merlot, with just 5% Cab Sauvignon, this Bordeaux blend is from a vineyard in the cooler, southern part of Napa Valley, influenced by Carneros breezes. Yet in this hot-hot vintage, it's too ripe in jammy cherry and blackberry flavors, and the tannic structure has a rustic edge. Drink now.
This is a ripe, generous wine. The structure typical of Touriga Nacional is submerged in the perfumed blackberry and ripe plum flavors. It's a big wine, with tannins softly cushioned in the rich fruitiness. Drink from 2018.
Pineapple and sugar-cookie notes waft sweetly from the nose of this off-dry Gewürztraminer. Dense and mouth-filling, it's a bit brawny in structure, but refreshing grapefruit acidity and subtly sweet honey tones lend brightness. A hint of bramble lingers on the finish.
Licorice aromas are matched by herbal, horsey notes on this earthy, muscular Monastrell. A bold, high-volume palate is home to plum, currant and blackened flavors, while an integrated, lightly herbal finish is fresh and powerful, with a firm structure that will ensure at least several additional years of life. Drink through 2023.
This is a wine that feels heavy, with rich apricot flavors that lack freshness and balance. It's not a wine for aging, but will go well with cakes or pastries.
A lovely Pinot Noir whose light, silky texture houses enormously complex flavors. The alcohol is nice and low, giving the cherry and pomegranate fruit a limpid translucence. Delicious now, and should develop for 5–6 years.
There are slightly dulled or aged characteristics of apricot, melon and butterscotch. It livens up in the mouth thanks to its stone fruit flavors although the finish tastes heavy and thick.
This wine enters dry, then turns raisiny sweet on the finish. It's big, voluptuous and soft in acidity, with furry tannins.
A second Rhône-style blend from Ott & Murphy, this one based upon Cinsault (38%), Syrah (37%) and Mourvèdre (22%) with a splash of Viognier. It is the most interesting of the winery's 2008 reds, with spiced apples, plums, clove, cumin and other exotic accents, a soft earthiness and medium complexity.
Great price for a Chardonnay of this quality. The grapes come from cool coastal areas, and the wine brims with crisp, long hangtime ripeness, accented with toasty oak. Feels rich and creamy, with pineapple, tropical fruit and vanilla flavors.
A touch of 7% Sémillon rounds out this Sauvignon Blanc, the fruit from both Rutherford and Yountville in the heart of the Napa Valley. Subtle on the nose, it offers elegant layers of tart squeezed lemon and a bite of melon.
There is a nice lift to the aromas, which focus on sweet black-cherry fruit. Streaks of cola and brown sugar come into play in the mouth, but the rich fruit is the star of the show.
This is a new, mid-priced line from venerable Napa producer Raymond. It's okay, maybe a little pricy, but there's some good cherry-berry fruit. Loses a point or two for roughness and sweetness, though.
This easy and bright Chianti Classico opens with tasty flavors of cherry and ripe raspberry backed by pipe tobacco and pressed blue flowers. It's a smooth, crisp wine that does a good job of showcasing Tuscan and Sangiovese typicity.
Fairly rubbery and smoky on the nose, with hickory aromas vying with blueberry and plum notes. Feels good and full, with sweet berry flavors and plenty of oak. In fact, this is a woody, modern style of Mencía that's lengthy and round.
A full-figured cuvée from older vines, this wine is estate-grown, bottled and left unfiltered, a grand concoction of butter, baked pear and crème brûlée. Given almost two years in 50% new French oak, it's intended to offer richness and concentration, and does it well.
Potent and intense, this has a dark red color that goes to the rim and exotic huckleberry and dark cherry aromas. Thick layers of fruit, dark chocolate and spice on the palate combine with firm, framing tannins and acidity for a lip-smacking finish. It will get better with age through at least 2018.
A bright, light and fruity wine that's already delicious to drink. With lemon and green apple fruit, it also has acidity that cuts through the aftertaste.
This is a superb wine, broad and rich but with complexity from mature vines and wood aging. For a 2003—a hot year—this still brings together some great acidity. Can drink now, but will age over the next 10 years.
90—92 Barrel sample. Dry botrytis is the theme here, with richness rather than sweetness. Somewhere under all that dryness is acidity and flavors of sweet pears, but these are a long way off.
A vibrant yellow-gold color and a good blend of delicate citrus and butter in the aroma and flavor give this understated and medium-bodied wine the balance and interest to satisfy.
A pure expression of Petit Verdot from sunny, southern Tuscany, Per Cecco features deeply etched aromas of chocolate, ripe cherry, espresso bean, leather, plum cake and savory spice. The tannins are firm and need a few more years to evolve and soften.
Pear and creamy apples round out a soft, fruity wine. The Arinto grapes give a plum skin tightness to the structure, but the main character is of a full, ripe but also fresh wine.
With enough Syrah to qualify for a varietal label, the wine is certainly high in alcohol and sweet in ripe, jammy fruit. But it works. It's sweet but not cloying, with cassis, cherry liqueur and chocolate flavors, and a sexy, velvety texture. Combines power with softness.
This is a wildly exotic wine, vibrantly abuzz in cranberry, pomegranate and rhubarb, a side note of barnyard-like earth and pretty rose petal. Tight-grained acidity remains firm in the glass and supportive of a grittiness of texture, notes of clove and black tea spiked throughout.
This is an acidic, sharp wine, in the manner of many California Sangioveses. It's severely dry and tannic, with only modest flavors of cherries.
This is a smooth and supple expression of Syrah from Sicily with soft tannins, good structure and a whole lot of juicy berry flavors. You'll also detect a hint of tobacco or smoked ham on the close.
Crisp, lightly herbaceous wine with a delicious creamy apple and pear character. This is finely balanced with a lively, crisp aftertaste. Screwcap.
Loamy, soft aromas of plum and berry don't show much punch. In the mouth, this is mostly fresh, with a solid feel. Flavors of plum, raspberry, red currant and herbal notes skew toward red, while a punchy, bright finish is upbeat. This is 75% Cabernet Sauvignon, 18% Carmenère and 7% Cabernet Franc.
This is fermented in neutral barrels, so it is a rounder, more open style than Pinot Gris done in stainless steel. It is therefore more approachable at a young age, and also tastes leesy and creamy—a treat for the palate. The fruit is lean and fresh, and a bracing minerality infuses the finish.
This is an interesting six-grape blend that's not like most other Chilean specimens. It starts with a leathery note as well as eucalyptus, licorice and lightly minty fruit aromas. It feels cheeky and tannic but mature, with baked berry, raisin and chocolate flavors. Dark, spicy and chocolaty until the last remnants of the finish conclude; this needs lots of air to show its best.
Earthy aromas of truffle, leather, dried herb and dark berry slowly take shape in this full-bodied red. Smooth and concentrated, the palate doles out fleshy wild cherry, raspberry compote, and savory orange zest and star anise notes, framed by fine-grained tannins. Drink 2019–2025.
One of the best Cabernet-Syrah blends out there. The Cabernet dominates, with firm tannins and blackberry and currant flavors, but Syrah brings a meatiness, like teriaki beef. Terrifically interesting, this wine should develop over the next four years.
This New Mexico red blend offers a nose of herbs, currants and pepper and a balanced red fruit and acid character. A touch of oak and a spin of leather give it added dimension. Though the tannins are soft, the wine has an ageable character. Pair with southwestern cuisine and grilled meats.
Rusty in color and mature on the nose, with classic aromas of tobacco, cedar, spiced raisin and delicate red berries. At its peak, with mouthcoating, rendered tannins and a core of berry and spiced plum flavors. Fades on the finish; best to drink this soon.
While 2011 has been widely seen as one of the great Port vintages for long-term aging, there are also wines, like this, that are so attractive they can be drunk early. This wine, with its perfumed character and red fruit flavors, is soft, fruity and will be ready to drink from 2016.
There's plenty of toast for the new-oakies, but it's wrapped around lovely raspberry and plum fruit. Light notes of mint and leather add interest; the wine resonates nicely and gently fades rather than falling off a cliff. Not as massively ripe as the 2003, but equally fine.
Caramel and spice flavored that is full-bodied and rich. With its weight, this red plum and ripe strawberry flavored wine is for food, dry and finishing with just the right amount of acidity. Screwcap.
Pineapple, pear and honey on the nose are followed by tropical fruit and melon on the palate. Sweet and fruity with a honeyed finish, it's not the most sophisticated wine in the world, but will please fans of sweeter styles.
Structured wine with a severe edge from the dry, concentrated tannins. It's serious, stalky fruit layered with a more juicy element and tight acidity. The wine does need aging to soften its austere character.
A wood-aged wine, with aromas that are certainly dominated by toast. The taste is more fruity, with pineapple and mandarin orange flavors giving a fine edge of acidity. Age for a year for the wood to integrate more.
Lots of crisp, crunchy acidity in this Chardonnay, with distinct flavors of pineapples. Oak adds vanilla and buttered toast. Rich and elaborate, although lacking complexity. Drink now.
Yellow fruits and apple juice combine in this fresh, mineral-driven wine. It's tangy, tight with acidity while allowing room for pineapple and tropical flavors at the end. It's ready to drink but will be better in 2016.
Herbaceous aromas of mint and catnip are heavy on the nose, which also gives off a note of licorice gumdrop. This Malbec is tight and raw in feel, while herbal, spicy plum and currant flavors finish somewhat green.
With a high proportion of Mourvèdre in the blend, the wine is structured and finely perfumed. It has some firm tannins that are well integrated into the red-berries. While the wine is richly textured, it is also bursting with fruit at the end. Drink from 2018.
Jammy and lush smelling, yet more racy, acidic and flashy in the mouth. Flavors of cherry and raspberry are saturated and dense, but the feel is kind of hard and narrow. Minty and a little warm on the finish. 70% Malbec and 30% Petit Verdot.
There's an unripe, green edge to this Zinfandel that detracts from its appeal. Yet it has some good blackberry fruit, and it's nicely dry and tannic. Pair this with rich meats and cheeses to coax out the sweetness.
Fazio's expression of Insolia offers a slightly denser concentration and a more saturated color than you'd expect. The wine is redolent of mature fruit, peach, melon and almond. In the mouth, it is soft and slightly fat.
This has the richness of barrel fermented Sémillon (“French stainless steel”) without actually having any. Residual sugar just over 1%; gives it roundness and a hint of honey.
The top wine from Quinta Nova is hugely rich, rather extracted and over the top. Chocolate, rather than fruit, dominates, giving a bitter edge and bringing out the wine's dark tannins. It's certainly impressive, and will soften in 3–4 years.
Ripe berries and violets scent this heady, perfumed Riesling. The palate is rich and confectionery in style with candied cherry and honey notes that linger amidst a dusty, earthy backdrop of crushed stones and minerals. It's a brisk, but slightly unbalanced wine, yet refreshing through the finish.
Totally fresh, crisp and with great acidity, this wine is all abut fruit. Citrus and crisp green apple dominate. The end conveys a bright, tight, mineral texture.
Here's a cheerful Montepulciano d'Abruzzo that would pair with garlic bread or cold cut appetizers. The wine boasts a defined mineral vein and loads of berry fruit on the nose. In the mouth, it is solid and firm with a touch of spice at the end.
Chardonnay and Sauvignon grapes are blended to produce this fragrant white wine from Calabria, southern Italy. The Chardonnay component adds structure and creamy density, while the Sauvignon offers fresh floral aromas.
Big and rounded, this tastes rich and packed with ripe fruit. It as weight and a yellow fruit flavor, with notes of red apple and canteloupe. It is soft, delicious and almost ready to drink.
Veins of sweet cinnamon and chocolate run through the body of this thick, concentrated wine. Exceedingly soft and supple, it has penetrating endnotes of cherry preserves, blackberry pie and Middle Eastern spice.
Bright but spotty on the nose, with salinic red fruit aromas that are one part raspberry and one part pool water. The palate is in the narrow, tannic field but the flavors are good, with blackberry, bitter chocolate and generic darkness working the the palate and finish.
A blend of Grenache and Syrah, this is a soft, gentle wine. It's made for drinking now, and has delicious, forward flavors of cherry jam, red currants, milk chocolate and pie spices.
There are lots of orange, pineapple, Meyer lemon, lime, honey and spice flavors in this blend of Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Arneis and Gewürztraminer. It's brisk in acidity and a little sweet. Try pairing it with Chinese, Vietnamese and Thai foods.
Simple and jammy, this Zin shows fruity flavors of raspberries, cherries and oranges. It's a little sugary sweet.
An unusual nose of cinnamon, lychee and Christmas spice holds promise. Unfortunately, the palate is one-dimensional and lacking in flavor intensity, though some pleasant banana flavors peak through briefly before dropping in to a short finish.
This full-bodied blend of grapes from a wide assortment of top vineyards shows fine acidity, a good phenolic frame of citrus rind, and core flavors of lemon and grapefruit, green apple and white peach. There's a seam of butterscotch also, from aging in one-third new French Burgundian oak barrels.
This Prosecco-based sparkler (with fruit from outside the traditional Prosecco zone) offers creamy froth and sweet notes of peach, mint leaf and almond nut. It has medium intensity, nice crispness and a slightly sour note on the finish.
Who said Chile doesn't make cellar-worthy reds? This vintage of Montes Alpha M is well-oaked, strapped and structured. Early attackers will find coconut, mocha and chocolate running the show, but if you hold the wine for another two to five years, it will likely settle, balance out and become an excellent model for what is high-end Chilean Cabernet Sauvignon (with 20% other Bordeaux grapes).
This medium-bodied Bordeaux blend features deep spice, pepper and red cherry flavors. It's a soft wine with gentle tannins and a subtle overall character.
Made from Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a soft, rounded rosé, with red fruits right to the fore. With its attractive acidity, it is dry and very food friendly. Ready to drink.
A little burnt and rubbery on the nose, but with enough lemon and apple to balance things out. The palate is fleshy and soft, with banana and lemon as the lead flavors. Shows a bit of pithy bitterness late, but overall it's good if you like sweet, warm Chardonnays.
Tasted beside Stemmler's estate Pinot, this one's richer and more concentrated, but very similar, even though it's from a different appellation, suggesting a consistent winemaker approach. It's medium-bodied and silky, with ripe rhubarb, cola and cherry-pie flavors finished with oak and vanilla. Drink this elegant and complex wine now.
Aromas of scorched earth, game and a whiff of farmyard lead the nose. The palate offers dried black cherry, leather, anise and sage alongside bracing but fleeting tannins. It finishes abruptly, leaving a rather astringent close.
The vineyard lies in the Van Duzer corridor, and the regular winds thicken the grape skins, giving chewy, astringent tannins. Tart plum and wild-cherry fruit flavors carry a peppery bite. The wine was aged for nine months in a neutral barrel of Oregon oak.
86–88. Barrel sample. This is a soft, open wine with light acidity and some balancing tannins. It's a fruity wine that's light in style and finishes with freshness.
Most Domaine Serene single-vineyard wines are grown right on the Dundee Hills estate; this one reflects a different home, in the Eola Hills AVA. It's a delicious riot of red and blue fruits, with toast, chicory and a touch of licorice threaded through. The balance and muscle are there to keep this in fine shape through at least 2027, but it's delicious right now, so why wait?
Chalky, intensely mineral aromas stand out in contrast to the plush, intensely fruity palate of this Cabernet Franc rosé. Slightly off dry in style, its black plum and cherry flavors are voluptuously rich and ripe, accented by fresh cranberry acidity.
Elegant and initially timid, this opens slowly to reveal notes of cinnamon bun, baked cherry, blackberry pie and chopped rosemary. The close is spicy and bright, showing structure and power.
Rustic and rough in the mouth, but shows basic Champagne-style dryness and yeastiness, with pleasant citrus flavors. Good price for an everyday sparkler.
Simple and straightforward aromas of red berry and mineral cap the aromatic nuances expressed in the Brunello Riserva. What the wine lacks is complexity, although it does feel rich, smooth and bright in the mouth. A Marc de Grazia selection; various American importers.
Malvasia is one of the workhorse grapes from southern Italy that never gets enough respect. This expression from Molise offers mature aromas of yellow fruit, summer flowers and pear. It has an easy disposition and cheerful character with a lean texture and sweet fruit flavors.
This has fragrances of ripe black cherry, raisin and a touch of leather. The palate delivers raisin and raspberry flavors, along with spicy black pepper notes. The palate is a bit evolved, showing tertiary notes.
The aromas of lychee, lime, herb and white flowers are pungent. The palate brings a light spritz, with the concentration seeming wanting.
A dusty, yeasty nose is simplistic but friendly. On the palate, this foams up in an aggressive manner, yet orange and peach flavors ride a wave of bubbly foam towards a lightly citrusy but plump finish.
The dark raspberry, plum, herb, vanilla and spice aromas and flavors are rich and high octane. It's not for the faint of heart but offers plenty of appeal.
This opens with balsamic aromas, leather, ripe raspberry, iris and a heady whiff of pressed powder while the succulent, delicious palate delivers ripe black raspberry, cake spice and aromatic herb. Firm, polished tannins provide structure and envelope the palate. Drink 2018–2025.
Made in the modern cult style, this 100% varietal Cabernet is soft and lush. While it's technically dry, it tastes sweet, the result of ripe fruit, high alcohol and lots of charry new oak. Shows oodles of chocolate, black currant and plum flavors that end in a swirl of Asian spices. Now through 2012.
This is a simple and soft wine. It has semi-sweet flavors of cola and cherry.
Ripe and forward, this attractive and well-balanced wine is delicious now but also shows the stuffing to evolve over the next few years. Complex yet focused, notes of apple, yellow melon, citrus zest, toasted brioche and beeswax mix harmoniously, ending with a long and evolving finish that transitions from bright fruit to lush oak and finally subtle sweet spice.
The briary, red fruit aromas are slightly prickly slightly, becoming fuller and deeper with time in glass. This feels solid and fairly dense for the price, with berry, peppery spice and light herb flavors. Fruity and friendly on the finish.

The palate is tight and crisp, with choppy tannins. Flavors of toasty oak and berry fruit compote finish resiny, with juicy, zesty acidity. Drink through 2021.
Principally sourced from the winery's oldest block of Cabernet Sauvignon, this offers a solid core of dense black cherry and cassis fruit. There's a streak of cola and sassafras, and the wine seems to lighten up as it sails into the finish. The blend includes 10% Cabernet Franc and 5% Petit Verdot.
The flower and peach aromas are quite subdued for the variety. The stone-fruit flavors provide more generosity while still displaying elegance.
This wine starts on the shy side but with several minutes in glass reveals delicate notes of lemon-lime, watermelon rind and grass along with a touch of butter in the background. It's the palate that's of real interest here. Prickly acidity is backed up with a chalky texture, a hint of spice, and a long lemony finish. This is a light and refreshing drop, with a hint of seriousness thrown in for good measure.
Colheita must be barrel-aged for at least seven years, but Poças went for the long haul, bottling this in 2017. The result is a deep-gold color and richly mature flavors. Caramel, spice and a dry edge from the wood aging gives it character, just hinting at the brandy, with acidity at the end. It is rich and ready to drink.
This is overtly charred and blackened on the nose, as if it were exposed to maximum-toast oak during the aging process; additional aromas of charred beef and herbs add complexity.

This Bordeaux blend offers a bouquet of cassis fruit with earth, tobacco and slight herbaceous flavors with a licorice note on the palate flow to an elegant, tart black-cherry, pepper and earth-tinged finish.  Drinkable now, but still taut, it should develop well over the next three to five years.
This is light and seems a little sparkly, as if there is a hint of secondary fermentation going on. For Cab Franc it's light and generic, without the spice or substance of the grape.
Powerful, youthful and still a bit raw, the newest release of DeLille's signature red blend shows a range of fruit from cherry and blackberry to dark notes of raisin and balsamic. It's still melding together its aggressive barrel toast, showing good structure and balance for long-term aging. Despite its almost 15% alcohol, it is balanced and even.

Heavy and extracted, with jammy berry-cherry flavors wrapped into firm tannins. Oak adds sweet caramelized vanilla. Drink now.
In this lightly fruity wine, apples and citrus flavors come with a bright, crisp character. Ready to drink. Screwcap.

This 50-50 blend of Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon shows dried strawberries, violets, lilacs, chocolate sauce and cappuccino on the nose. The palate offers dark chocolate, strawberry and cherry flavors, along with a leveling effect from pencil lead and graphite. Watch for a future in this sort of blend from the Central Coast.
Winemaker Billo Naravane (Rasa) has a handle on Syrah. This brings unusual sweet/tart candy fruit flavors wrapped into a juicy, tart, tightly wound wine that flows gracefully across the palate. Though aged for 18 months in 40% new French oak, the barrel flavors are well in the background. It's a clean, sappy wine, with a soft, gentle fade.
From a fine vintage, this is a rich and dense wine. While it does have structure and firm tannins, the fruit is so generous and opulent that it could almost be drunk now. It's ripe, juicily sweet and full of blackberry juice flavors. It will develop, though, and will be even more tasty in 2016.
This old-vine Zin tastes of tar and overripe fruit and is blandly sweet.
A great value white with 8,000 cases imported, so it should be relatively easy to find. Tart gooseberry and lemon flavors integrate with hints of fresh herbs, green hay and soft smoke. Medium weight but lively with gently prickly acidity that lingers through the finish.
The nose starts nicely, with plenty of plum and dark berry fruit, a hint of green adding character. Upon entry the wine picks up some barnyard flavors which vie with blueberry and anise. If not for this wine's dry and chalky tannins, it would have scored higher.
Minerally on the bouquet, with apple and oceanic notes. Turns citric and acidic on the palate, with pineapple, orange and tangy flavors. Shows astringency on the finish, but at least it's juicy and driving.
Briny stone-fruit aromas are sweetened by notes of apple blossom. A full, slightly foamy palate is lively but brusque, while this tastes of yeasty peach and apricot in front of a mildly bitter finish.
Earthy, spicy aromas suggest tilled earth, Mediterranean brush, ground black pepper, cedar and clove. The vibrant palate offers blackberry, black currant, tobacco, dark spice and anise alongside firm tannins.
A dark, brooding and concentrated wine, this boasts rich black-fruit aromas and flavors of blackberry, boysenberry and cherry that are flecked with accents of tar, licorice, leather and peppery curing spice.

Delicious now, but this should age well through 2022.
Black cherry and blueberry mix on nose and palate of this fruit-forward red. They are joined by a lively, invigorating pepperiness and balanced by freshness. This makes for joyful, uncomplicated but still sophisticated drinking. The cherry fruit lingers beautifully.
This is a bit Sancerre-ish in its light to medium body, aromas of struck flint and crisp flavors of grapefruit. Riper hints of fig and melon betray its New World origins, but it still finishes tart and racy.
A pleasant, if somewhat light offering, featuring bright Grenache fruit highlighted by red cherries and hints of black pepper. Finishes with a touch of stemmy astringency that adds needed grip.
Forest floor, iris, menthol, mature blackberry and leather aromas unfold on this firmly structured red. On the palate, ground pepper, licorice and a green note of powdered sage accent a core of mature black cherry. An assertive tannic backbone provides support but leaves a somewhat gritty, astringent finish.
There is just the slightest whiff of barnyard here, delicate enough to be a feature rather than a flaw. Baking spices, tanned leather, and pretty red fruits mingle seamlessly through a satisfying mid palate. Perhaps it's just an early phase, but for the moment it fades rather quickly.
For the second straight year, Chacayes scores major points among serious Argentine wines competing for the world's attention. This blend of 80% Malbec and 20% Cabernet is deep, dark and seductive. It's all about compact, intense fruit supported by hefty tannins. Very nice and perfectly ripe. Hold a couple of years for best results.
Great structure, depth and polish are the talking points of this wine that remains stubbornly young, tight and primary, with Bordeaux-like herbaceousness. There is plenty of power and future potential—if the light, pickle barrel and herbal rawness can be tamed.

Beyond those are steady, savory pulses of tobacco, leather and dark cedar. The wine is plush, textured and rich, with a polished firmness that keeps it grounded on the palate.
This old domaine dating from the 16th century is run by one of the most famous families in Burgundy. It produces a ripe yet crisp Hautes Côtes de Nuits, with enough lively acidity to balance its rich yellow and citrus fruit. It will be ready to drink soon, certainly from late 2017.

This is a sweet, honeyed wine that's powerful and concentrated. It's full of spice, ripe tropical fruits and pleasurable sweetness. Just behind all this richness lies a great acidity that's so attractive. The wine could be drunk now, but it will be even better from 2017.
Belnero is a Sangiovese-based wine (with a tiny percentage of outside grapes) that shows loads of Montalcino typicity and elegance. If the rules governing Rosso di Montalcino are changed, those new wines might resemble Belnero.
A traditional and relatively light garnet color is the first sign that this is not a blatantly commercial wine. Savory, almost meaty, and cranberry-like aromas confirm the impression. Take a good sip and more crisp fruits like raspberries and red cherries emerge along with hints of cinnamon and clove for complexity. While medium bodied, it's vibrant in texture and elegantly balanced. It should improve through 2022.

Aromas suggest stone fruit, peach blossom and Spanish broom. On the palate, notes of banana and nectarine accent a core of juicy yellow peach. It's balanced with crisp acidity that leaves a refreshing finish.

Herbal berry aromas include a heavy dose of spent coffee grinds and oak. This has an edgy, hard mouthfeel and oaky flavors of plastic and vanilla that sit on top of herbal berry notes. A creamy finish maintains the wine's oaky theme.
Green apple and tangerine figure into this thin-layered wine that's sourced from estate vineyards as well as purchased Russian River Valley fruit. Straightforward and unfussy, the wine is ready to enjoy now.
Cheese and crackers on the nose, meaning it's not all that fruity and clean. In the mouth, it's also bisquits and cheddar city. And the feel is round and foamy, with a dry, chalky finish that erases much of what came prior. One can only say this bubbly has its issues.
This is nominally a step up from De Bortoli's dB Selection Petite Sirah, but this fresh, directly fruity wine doesn't seem to offer much beyond jammy fruit. It's medium-bodied, with a crisp finish and just a hint of tannic structure. Drink now–2012.

With a hint of yellow color, this fuller-bodied Torrontés presents classic aromas of bath oils, white flowers and tropical fruits. The palate is plump and melony, with modest acidity that says “drink me now.” Flavors of melon and lychee finish soft and creamy.
This is a darkly fruity and spicy wine from a site overlooking the Marin Coastal range, often shrouded in fog. Planted to five clones, the site provides plenty of cardamom, clove, forest floor and black tea while allowing for a wildness of plum tart and crusty bread. The oak imprint is light.
Bright and plump fruits of black plum and boysenberry are drizzled with tar and dusted with savory peppercorns on the nose of this bottling, which also has a gamy hint of roast lamb. The palate is a tad thin but full of flavor, with boysenberry, lavender and thyme flavors.
Light fruit suggests strawberries with a slightly green edge. The tannins are still a bit rough and tumble, with a peppery kick.
The aromas are a bit candy-sweet, like pink bubble gum and Lifesavers, and in the mouth that impression of sugar is confirmed. The flavors are firmly on the peach side. It’s clean, but simple, and finishes a little sugary and syrupy.
A little choppy and tannic, with thin red-fruit aromas. The palate is of medium depth, with a bit of tannin-driven rawness to make things a little harder than ideal. Otherwise it's steady and warming.

This is an ripe and fruity LBV that is bottled ready to drink.

It has a reminiscence of the perfumed character that is typical of Taylor Fladgate Vintage Ports while being more immediately approachable. Drink now.
Young, fairly tough in tannins, and with a sappy, grapy taste, this is a wine that badly needs time in the bottle, as do most S&B; Pinots. It shows primary fruit flavors of cherries and blackberries, offset by crisp acidity despite full malolactic fermentation. Should begin to come into its own by 2008, improving through 2012 and holding for years afterward.

Domaine de la Mordorée's 2014 rosés are fitting tributes to proprietor Christophe Delorme's final vintage (he died in June 2015).

This is young, quite sharp and still showing some rough edges. The fruit is crisp and pure, with well-defined flavors of raspberry and cherry candy. The tannins have a green tea, earthy quality, but some additional bottle age will help round them out.
Forward aromas and flavors of vanilla and melted butter give a lot of richness to this medium-bodied wine. It has a candy-like quality and a creamy sweet-seeming finish.

This is a tense, textured wine that is still young. Bright, tangy acidity is balanced by apricot and pear flavors, bringing out a delicious yet refreshing character. The wine needs a few more months, so drink from 2016.
Exuberantly rich in cherries and blackberries, with a huge, sweet and smoky coating of oak. The tannins are thick and dusty and flashy. A young, dramatically structured wine, it could easily develop in the bottle over the next 6–8 years.
A selection of the better barrels from the Home Ranch, the Reserve is fantastically rich and complex. No mere fruit bomb despite scads of flavors ranging from apples and peaches through pears and mangoes, there's also a sleek backbone of steel, all of it wrapped in a rich, honeyed texture. The finish is long and intricately constructed of dusty brown spices.
Truffled earth, sage and cedar rise from thick, harsh tannins that are still tightly wound and domineering. From a single vineyard site and aged in bottle for a few years, it features a density to the blackberry fruit that plays nicely with the vanilla oak.
This classically styled red with 9% Merlot and 2% each of Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot impresses with perfumed violet and its soft, smooth and succulent black cherry and currant flavor. Approachable and round, it has cedar and mocha undertones that make it memorable and compelling.
Not many wineries make Charbono anymore. It's a bone-dry wine, strong in tannins and earthy, with a resemblance to Barbera. Summers' 2008 is quite fine and elegant for the variety, with dried berry, currant, leather, coffee and spice flavors. It should slowly develop over the next dozen years, mellowing and sweetening.
This Rhône blend is ripe to the point of off-dry, with flamboyant flavors of ripe white peaches, lime pie, vanilla custard and smoke. With a creamy texture, it has a long aftertaste.
There is no sign of the tannic punch of Malbec in this wine. Instead the texture is soft and open with just enough tannins to give shape to the delicious black currant fruitiness. The wine is ready for a glass now.
This wine is soft and creamy, with a layer of herbal fruitiness. As the name indicates, the grapes come from near two seas (mers): Sauvignon Blanc from the Atlantic and Viognier from the Mediterranean. The combination is refreshing and attractively, with a balance of crisp fruit and a soft texture.
Some 85% of this was whole-cluster fermented, bringing plenty of grip and tannin along with plum and cherry fruit. There are typical Eola-Amity Hills suggestions of clean earth also, and the aging in one-third new French oak brings a little fullness to this substantial, still youthful wine.
This opens with sweet, compact aromas of raisin and spice. It feels more perky and crisp in the mouth, with a slight acidic cut and flavors of roasted berry, herb and chocolate. The finish is lightly herbal and minty, with peppery spice and plenty of length. A classic Bordeaux blend of roughly one-third each of Cabernet, Merlot and Cabernet Franc.
It may be vendange tardive, but the sweetness is the least of this wine's qualities. It is more to do with how it relates to the terroir of the Heimbourg vineyard, with its mineral character, and its fine structure and texture. The fruit is still young, and would benefit from 5–10 years aging.
An intense and spicy wine, with textures of cream and flavors of pepper. Very dry, it doesn't stray far from its mineral character, giving richness as much as freshness. Imported by Vin Divino.
This is a supple, spicy wine, with a core of black cherry fruit. It's complemented with lighter flavors of cola, earth and coffee. At first it seems to fade a little too quickly, but with some breathing time the finish expands and brings in notes of cracker and toast.
It may have had a few winemaking controversies in recent years, but Giscours is now on a roll, under the ownership of Dutch businessman Eric Albada Jelgersma. How good it is, is shown in the 2001 wine, which is generous, almost opulent, rich and dense. Despite the richness, though, this is still Bordeaux: Dry tannins, tarry black-fruit flavors and firmness place the wine definitely at the table.
Inky red-violet in the glass, this wine has aromas of black cherry and chocolate. It is pleasing on the palate, with fruit-dominated flavors of cherry, raspberry, pomegranate, vanilla and espresso. Smooth soft tannins linger a moment past a finish marked by a splash of cranberry with a touch of freshly ground coffee.

The alcohol is nice and low, just 13.3%, but the wine tastes like it has residual sugar, with apricot jam and pineapple jelly flavors. Crisp acidity helps, but it's really too sweet for a table wine.
This is a solid, darkly tannic wine balanced with black fruits and brisk acidity. It is a powerful and concentrated wine, solidly structured and full of fruit, but it needs to age. Don't drink before 2016.
Although it's not indicated on the front label, this is 100% Shiraz, sourced from 60-year-old vines in the Ebenezer district and 90-year-old vines near Gomersal.

Not jammy or overblown, it has enough structure to suggest a drinking window from 2010–2020.
Chalky in texture, the wine has an edgy texture lightened by sweet currant flavors. It has freshness from sweet apple acidity, the sweetness kept in check by minerality and structure.
Shows the ill effects of age on this style of wine already. The vibrant, fresh fruit is fading, being replaced by some dusty spice notes.
At five years, this Cabernet is not aging well. It's soft and simple, with the black cherry fruit flavors thinning out, letting hot alcohol show through.
This appellation has shown great promise with the variety and this wine demonstrates why. Aromas and flavors of dried and baked plum center on a juicy, soft core, accented in pencil shavings and cedar. Red cherries and a long finish complement the whole.

Unlike many '05 Rhônes, this is made in a soft, silky, approachable style, marrying brandied cherries with cinnamon and clove and supple tannins. Shows a touch of warmth on the finish. Drink now-2018.
Here is a delightfully creamy and fragrant Chardonnay with smooth qualities that transfer to the nose as peach cobbler, honeysuckle and exotic fruit. The wine is crisp and snappy in the mouth with a playful touch of exotic spice that breaks up the fullness of its naturally rich texture. Excellent price tag too.
A wine that is dominated by the perfumed Colombard, leaving the more herbaceous Sauvignon Blanc to one side. It is soft with just a light lemon zest edge. Screwcap.
Aromas of resin, coconut and ripe plum lead the nose. The forward, ripe palate offers prune steeped in spirits, dried black cherry, vanilla, coffee, coconut, oak and drying tannins.
A severe wine, its structure deriving from an important wood element and fruit tannins. It brings out apple and green plum skins, with a tangy texture that demands a few months aging.
Honeyed, botrytis aromas come with notes of peach, nectarine and cinnamon. This is lifted but a touch sticky on the palate, with flavors of honey, spice and white pepper. All these flavors carry onto the finish, which quickly loses its steam.
There's hardly any oak on this wine, so what you get is pure, clean Sauvignon character. With crisp acidity, the wine brims with lemon, lime, green melon, vanilla and spice flavors, with a hint of tart gooseberry. It's totally dry.
Clean and varietally correct, this Cab offers direct flavors of blackberries, currants and smoky oak. It's a balanced young wine made for immediate consumption.

So good now, you can hardly keep your hands off the cork, but it should develop for many years.

A core of ripe, dense blackberry and cherry flavors pulsates from within this lusciously textured red blend. It's a bold, robustly structured wine, but elegantly composed with spry acidity and fine-grained, persistent tannins. It's ready to drink now with a brief decanting but could improve through the next decade.
This is nearly perfect, a massive, monumental wine whose sheer power is matched only by its grace and refinement. The flavors of blackberries, cassis, dark chocolate, buttered toast and cedar flood the mouth, tightly controlled by firm tannins and good acidity. Decant for several hours if you open it now, but better to give it 6–10 years in the bottle.
A Sardinian red with beautiful violet, root beer and dark fruit across the bouquet. Quite racy on the palate, where red fruit and spice combine in a forceful, full-flavor way. Melted chocolate and coffee flavors make for a fine finish. A touch hard, however, due to firm, unyielding tannins.
Super-fresh, this is tight, full of green fruit and crisp apple flavors. It has some concentration under all this freshness, a structure coming from the cool year. This is classic, but very superior, seafood-friendly Muscadet.
It's easy to throw high scores at almost any well-made P.X. because the wines are so viscous and overwhelmingly sweet. And while this one fits that bill, it has a couple of holes in it, namely a nose that stumbles out of the gate and a mouthfeel that's almost too thick and rich. Very nice but not at that ultrahigh level.
Made from organically grown grapes, this wine is structured and still firm, with ripe berry fruits buried in the structure. As it matures, this rich wine will open out generously. Drink from 2019.
Quite pleasant and true to the variety. Punchbowl aromas of melon and passion fruit are friendly and not the least bit harsh. The palate is fresh and lithe, with layered, defined flavors of passion fruit and tangerine. Like a mountain stream in terms of freshness, with just enough intensity and style to draw attention.
The blend sees 90% Chardonnay and 10% Pinot Nero and the wine rests for 36 long months on the lees to produce an extremely creamy and inviting sparkler that is elegant and sophisticated yet genuine at the same time. Yeasty notes of bread crust and apple pie are the most obvious aromas but are soon followed by stone fruit, honey and well-balanced mineral tones.
Whiffs of blossom and preserved red cherry lend delicate perfume to this exceptionally light-footed Pinot Noir. Tart cranberry and raspberry flavors are refreshing and crisp, but almost ephemeral in concentration. The finish is swift. Drink now.

Pronounced aromas of charred wood are imposing on the nose, but intense black fruit shines through on the palate, taming char into a more palatable blend of rich blackberry preserves, smoke and barnyard. The long finish ends with supple tannins and a touch of vanilla and mocha-kissed fruit.
A straightforward Syrah, it's solidly based on berry and black cherry fruit flavors, with clean earth and a vein of licorice running through. Drink now–2019.
Among an outstanding lineup of well-defined, beautifully refined Pinots from Le Cadeau, the Diversité takes top honors. Sourced from the winery's vineyard in the Chehalem Mountains, it shows excellent varietal character, with exceptional depth and detail. It beautifully melds the notes of mixed red fruit, light earth, and sensitively-applied barrel.
This opens with a classic Rioja nose of leather, dried cheese, roast berry and spice. It feels chunky and quite solid, with roasted fruit, tomato and herbal flavors on a deep palate. This is long and a touch warm on the finish, but healthy and ready to drink.
Deep and leafy, with a rich, almost murky-mossy note. The palate, however, is raw and acidic. Thus the plum and berry flavors are in your face and short, with a peppery aftertaste.
A waxy lemon-peel note and a whiff of lanolin lend a mineral-driven slickness to this delicately textured, penetrating Riesling. Ripe tropical-fruit flavors are honeyed and intensely concentrated, yet the finish is elegant with a swathe of fresh, clean flowers.
With 4% Cab, this is a dry, tannic wine that tastes hot even though the official alcohol is 14.4%. The flavors are of raisins and stewed blackberries and cherries.
Perfumed in rose garden and earthy compost, this effusively aromatic wine is tightly wound in oak. Yet it's youthful in characteristics of wild strawberry, tea and cardamom, the flavors still waiting to be fully revealed.
Mint aromas, followed by young, fresh fruit topped with firm tannins, make an impressively dense wine from one of Portugal's top winemakers. Flavors of mint and eucalyptus go with dark black fruits and concentration.

While forward, plump red-cherry and strawberry notes are buoyant, a deep vein of granite and minerals adds gravitas and complexity to this elegant wine. Fresh cranberry acidity drives a swift finish.
Fragrant and soft, this has a touch of spice that adds interest to the fresh lemon and bright apple fruitiness. With a gentle texture, it is ready to drink.
From another of Andy Beckstoffer's sites in Oakville, Missouri Hopper is a mix of cassis, kirsch and leather, its full-bodied structure marked in generous toasty oak. Tea and leather provide a savory edge, balancing the richness of the red fruit. Drink now through 2023.
A beautifully smooth, opulent, wood-aged wine, with a great depth of ripe fruit, spice, vanilla, fresh herbs and concentrated tannins. Good aging potential. Drink now.
This dazzling, dry and restrained wine was matured in new French oak but with such a light touch that it feels more lean than fat in texture. It has enough fruitiness—crisp apple and lemon flavors—and spice to make it tempting now, though it will improve with age. Best after 2020.
For an unwooded Chardonnay, this is unusually plump and pillowy in texture, with layers of tropical fruit given shape on the finish by a squirt of citrus. A hint of spice adds extra nuance to this crowd-pleasing wine.
Gerhard Markowitsch's house wine reveals his skills as a red winemaker. Blending Pinot Noir and Zweigelt brings out the earth character in both grapes, but also offers rich tannins and a packed palate of fruit flavors, backed by tannins. Screwcap.
Rustic and fruity, with jammy flavors of cherries, raspberries, mocha and spices. Drink with short ribs.
This is a solid example of straight-ahead Washington merlot. The fruit is pretty and polished, bright with raspberry and cherry flavors, forward but with the palate presence to age for some years. There's a foundation of herb and a hint of silage, adding character but finishing just a bit on the funky side.
Grilled vegetable, celery and camphor aromas lead the nose of this wine. The palate is raw, tight and tense, showing oak, roasted coffee bean and bitter sage flavors alongside raspy tannins.
This Aglianico offers a mélange of aromas, including vanilla, toast, ripe plum, prune, tobacco and a whiff of leather. The palate opens with juicy black fruit accented by notes of vanilla, mint, tobacco and espresso, but excruciatingly aggressive tannins dominate the finish and give it an abrupt, drying finish. Give this time to unwind.
Co-fermented with 3% Viognier, this Tablas clone Syrah offers red and purple berry flavors that are deep and pure. Snappy and focused, it's layered with notes of smoke, dust, citrus, blood orange, baking spices and mineral. Beautiful indeed.
This bright, savory wine offers yellow peach, citrus and green melon sensations accented with a light almond note. Crisp acidity gives a refreshing, clean finish.
A classic cava from top to bottom. The nose offers familiar baked apple, mineral and saline aromas, while the palate is exceedingly fresh in its delivery of pineapple, apple and nectarine flavors. A fruity yet crisp number that foams up nicely on the palate but doesn't lose its focus or form.
This new Chardonnay from chalky soils smells of lanolin and waxy orange. On the palate, this shows some minerality but mostly it's bulky and citric. Briny stone-fruit flavors finish flat.
Here's a supple, velvet-textured Merlot from the all-around successful 2012 vintage in California. It pulls together baking-spice aromas and attractive, ripe flavors of raspberry and cherry on the medium-bodied palate. It conveys a sense of breadth and meatiness without being heavy.
Red in color, with sweet aromas of sugar beet, Red Delicious apple and cherry. It feels zesty, with simple flavors of red fruit and red apple. The finish is dry and a touch peppery. Drink immediately while it's fresh.
Smoked strawberry and concentrated red plum aromas meet hickory smoke, fresh herb and rose petal scents in this great bottling. The zingy palate is fresh, lively and quite complex, from its oregano, thyme and tarragon notes to its core of pomegranate and dark raspberry fruit to its savory, leathery finish.
Coconut and toast from the very American oaking here predominate, with a hint of mint and faint wild berry flavors peeking through. Still, it's more espresso-like than overtly harsh, though puckery woody tannins rule on the back end.
One of Bouchard's signature wines, this is beautifully textured, a series of bright fruits, strawberries and sweet acidity. There are tannins, but this is lighter than in some vintages, a wine for short-term aging.
A very rich, opulent Pinot Noir. It's almost as sweet as a dessert, like a cherry and chocolate tart, but it's actually quite dry. Crisp acidity gives it a balancing snap. Now–2014.
This is a dark, plump expression of Sangiovese Grosso that delivers finely-tuned aromas of succulent fruit and blackberry. Notes of espresso and dark chocolate give the wine added dimension and staying power in the mouth.

Stunning aromas of rose, violet, licorice, Asian spices and mature dark-skinned fruit waft out of the glass. The juicy, savory palate offers wild cherry, crushed raspberry, orange zest, anise, clove and chopped herbs alongside bright acidity and soft, supple tannins. A fantastic Barbera.
Although this Cab is too young and tannic to drink now, it's impressive for its volume and depth, as well as the future possibilities. Shows a huge core of blackberries, currants and cassis, with a mineral tang and near-perfect oak application. Grows more complex and generous as it breathes in the glass. Give it 4–5 years in the cellar to soften and mellow.
This savory young wine has forward flavors of pineapples, Meyer lemons and green apple sauce. However, there's a brisk, underlying minerality and great acidity, making the wine seem exceptionally clean. Try pairing it with broiled or fried chicken and cole slaw.

Sharp and minty-green, with modest cherry-berry flavors that finish dry and tart. Drink now.

This flagship Prosecco Superiore offers rich smoothness accented by fresh notes of apricot, honey and white flower. It ends with a playful endnote of succulent sweetness.
Pale peach in color, this wine starts out a bit reduced, which causes initial distraction. The citrus flavors are light, with the concentration not seeming to be all there.
From the Heideboden vineyard, this mineral, structured wine has serious, dark fruits and an initial austerity. Spice, firm tannins and a dark character offer the potential for aging over a good few years–give it at least 4. Screwcap.
This blend of 66% Touriga Nacional and one-third Syrah is unique for Spain but qualifies as “international” in style. Cola, blueberry and floral aromas dominate, giving way to an easy feeling palate with cola, molasses, brown sugar and blackberry flavors. It's flavorful and rich but not overly complex or layered; drink this magnum now through 2017.
This is a ripe, lightly pink-colored wine, full of red fruits as well as crisp acidity. It is soft, with a gentle creamy mousse that rounds out in the mouth. It's ready to drink, leaving a warm while fresh aftertaste.
Bold Malbec with aromas of berry liqueur, cassis and black cherry. The palate is fresh in feel, with some edginess and snappy acids. Tastes full of berry fruit, creamy oak and vanilla, while the finish is round, lengthy and big. A little oaky and forced, but nice as Malbec goes.
This honest effort at a terroir-driven Cabernet starts with currant and blackberry aromas, although they’re a little on the weak side. Nice berry and spice flavors with a dash of wood. High acidity gives it a real bite, and it finishes a little sharp as well.
Light tawny in color, this palate-pleasing effort boasts stone fruit, orange blossom and fresh herb flavors. It's elegant and food-friendly in style, with the sort of detail that usually comes with a higher price tag.
Very tough and tannic now, and dry too, so that the ultimate impact is disagreeably harsh. That, despite a solid core of blackberries, black currants, violets, bacon and minerals. The question is one of ageability. The answer is that it's a gamble, as the wine, like the stock market, could go either way.
Minty earth tones frame this wine from a dramatic vineyard perched high amid the redwoods and shale soils of this mountainous region that impart forest underbrush, dried lilac and olallieberry aromas. The dark blackberry fruit flavors on the palate are enhanced by marjoram, dark clove, crushed fennel and Christmas spices.
This has a vivid, ripe, black cherry flavor, with fresh sweetness and bursting acidity. It makes for a gorgeous, generous character buoyed up by firm tannins, a lively texture and finish, and no noticeable oak. A great find from a small, ambitious Lake County winery that loves Italian varietals.
Layers of butter and spiced caramel accentuate the richness of this sumptuously ripe, full-bodied wine. Fresh, crisp apple and pear flavors freshen the midpalate, leading to a lingering sweet-spice finish.
Primarily composed of Syrah, this Rosé is delightfully tart and spicy, wrapping tangy strawberry fruit in light flavors of malted milk chocolate. Plenty of acid keeps it lively and fresh.
Blackberry and pressed violet aromas lead the nose of this bottling, while charred beef, lava rock and black soil scents provide depth. A roasted game flavor dominates the palate, spiced with black pepper and soy sauce and bolstered by a concentrated base of black fruit.
Aromas of white flowers and mild tropical fruits turn more gritty with time. In the mouth, this Viura is dilute but not empty. Flavors of Bartlett pear, lime and nectarine finish tangy and lean.
The great darling of Valpolicella, Campofiorin is a ripasso-style red that undergoes a special double fermentation, although the label does not mention “ripasso.” It shows impressive personality and complexity, with spice, ripe fruit, leather and dried ginger aromas.
Here's a big, gutsy Syrah that's ripe in blackberries, but also a little ungainly. There are some raisiny flavors as well as minty ones, giving it the taste of a Chinese sweet and sour cherry sauce.
A wine that relishes its juicy fruit and acidity. The tannins, by contrast, are light. Close to Macau, south of Margaux, Gironville is in a fresh, black currant-fruit style, not for aging.
Cygnus is a hearty blend of Nero d'Avola and Cabernet Sauvignon that opens with perfumed aromas of red rose and cinnamon potpourri followed by warm aromas of leather and spice. At the wine's core are black fruit and chocolate flavors.
Smells inert and dull, tastes soft and sugary sweet in cherry pie filling flavor. Production on this is 14,374.
With its gorgeous scents of spice cake and dates, this is a seductive LBV from the very start. It's ripe and round in the mouth, soft and lush on the finish, with a cavalcade of fig, date, chocolate and dried-spice flavors. Drink now. Imported by Premium Port Wines, Inc.

The finish is quite long, with delicious notes of raspberry and plum pudding buoyed by sinewy tannins. Keep several years for more complexity, then try with roasted venison.
A full-bodied style, dominated by flavors of almonds, which indicate that this is moving from fruity youth to maturity. But there is still plenty of acidity there. Has a few years of life yet, but it is a pleasure to drink now.
An intriguing nose of pine needles, slight barnyard, and a hint of dill is layered over ripe black cherries. A dense, yet soft and seductive wine that should reward cellaring with even more complexities.
A tremendous concentration of cherry, white pepper, coffee and thyme flavors marks this distinctive, complex Zin. It's very dry and supple, with good heft and fairly thick tannins. Best over the near term.
Sweet tones of prune, ripe cherry and moist pipe tobacco give this wine appeal and personality. The palate shows soft tones of chocolate and cooked cherry.
One notch up on the aromatic intensity ladder but slightly muddled in its complexity. The aromas are fresh, but lie somewhere between flowers and fruit. Silky, rich and smooth on the palate.
Baked blackberry, vanilla, dust and chocolate show on the nose of this blend of 69% Petite Sirah, 22% Grenache and 9% Tannat. The palate is ripe with plum, blueberry and black currant and lifted by dried ginger and nutmeg, but the dazzling acidity and tannic firmness is what takes it to the next level.
Rough, sinewy and oaky, this full-bodied wine is concentrated and thick, a robust expression of bitter black fruit and leather.
This is the second wine of Château Balestard, and there are suggestions of high extraction and very ripe fruit. It does have balance, however, the black fruits need time to calm down. The acidity is all here, offering freshness to this rich wine.
Peppery and mushroomy on the nose, this wine also features earthy, leathery notes that call to mind the Rhône. It's a pleasant drink in a rustic red sort of way, distinctive for NZ Pinot. Imported by Cordon Selections.
This creamy, mouthfilling Pinot Gris isn't particularly aromatic, but makes up for that on the palate, where it offers a modicum of pear fruit, plenty of weight and richness and just hints of oak and spice. Drink now.
Le Battistelle offers a thick and generous Soave Classico with loads of yellow fruit and floral intensity. It's a simple, clean wine with a crisp, refreshing mouthfeel.
Spicy and roasted on the nose, with little that's typical of Cabernet Sauvignon. Astringent like a rubber band across the palate, with roasted, earthy flavors that offer some sweetness but not much else.
Brilliant in color, with lots of oak and derivative aromas. The palate is sweet and rich, as if syrup and caramel had been infused into the package. Turns fiercely tannic on the back end, where an espresso bitterness rises up and steals away the finish. A bumpy ride with highs and lows. Imported by Laird & Company.
Whiffs of wildflowers, fennel and slate combine in this deliciously blossomy, complex wine. While dry in style, it's a touch softer and riper than the HJW or Josef Vineyard bottlings, coating the palate in a supple silk of peach and grapefruit flavors. Powerful and concentrated, it lingers long on the finish. Delicious now, but sure to improve through at least 2023.
A dash of Sémillon adds to the playfulness of this wine, which is medium-built and moderate-to-high in acidity. Tangy curls of lemon, lime and grapefruit evolve into a bristling back note of crispness that just begs for oysters.
This tiny maverick winery is doing wonderful things. This well-structured firmly textured wine offers a nice combo of ripe berry flavors, while touches of earth and oak give plenty to savor. It's medium to full in body, has moderate tannins, good balance and a lingering finish.
This delicious, fruity, lightly sweet wine blends ripe berries and black cherries on a smooth, supple texture. A touch of lip-smacking tannin balances it out.
Hot and chocolaty, with briary flavors of blackberry jam, plum currants, mocha and pepper. Turns Porty and raisiny on the finish. The alcohol is 16.5%.
A deliciously likeable Pinot Noir, sweet as a raspberry crumble pie, yet with qualities of mushrooms, minerals and something formidable from the earth that give it great complexity. The winemaker, Drake Whitcraft, has kept the alcohol to a relatively low 13.4% by volume, so the wine feels light and airy. Yet it possesses great seriousness. The vineyard is within a touchdown pass of the Santa Rita Hills boundary. Drink now–2020.
The aromas of this wine are slightly high-toned, offering bright notes of apple skin, tart cherry and small red-berry fruit. A touch of black pepper livens up the medium-weight palate and spices up the clean finish.
Smoky elements of roasted nut combined with jammy fruit make for an offbeat aromatic assembly. This is a raw, chewy wine with a dense, plush mouthfeel that needs a year or two to fully integrate.
Les Origines contains 30% Syrah and 20% Mourvèdre, both matured in oak casks, so there's always some baking spices and a somewhat open texture. Cinnamon and clove join plum and licorice in this full-bodied, velvety wine. It's powerful and rich, with a long finish. Drink now–2025.
Youthful, fresh and simple, Brillando (a blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet and Merlot) offers a solid core of berry flavors and a clean, smooth close. This is an informal Tuscan wine that could pair nicely with pasta or pizza.
An interesting blend of 50% Pinot Noir, 30% Pinotage and 20% Chardonnay, this sparkling rosé boasts bright aromas and flavors of watermelon rind, strawberry hull, peach pit and citrus rind. It's soft and approachable, with a subtle smoky spice tone to the finish.
This is a cave cooperative's top white Crozes bottling, fermented and aged in oak. Smoky, toasty notes support exotic apricot and pineapple fruit that's initially attractive, then doesn't quite follow through on the finish. Drink now.

Dark and meaty, soft and full, with a very light touch of leather, this nicely catches hold of the varietal character, yet here it's coupled with vivid, fresh and ripe cherry fruit. It's a fine expression of the evolving style of Tempranillo in central Oregon, styled for both immediate enjoyment and cellaring over the next six to eight years.
A warm, ripe and fruity wine that holds a mix of crisp apple acidity and richer yellow fruits. There is just enough acidity to give freshness while the wine has a richer, full character. It should age until 2015.
This is a perfumed wine with yellow fruit and baked apple flavors. Attractive and with delicious acidity, it's ready to drink now.

Minerally and neutral on the nose, this tastes fresh and crisp like a green apple, with dry flavors of white fruit and bitter almond. It retains that almond character on the finish, which turns even drier and more bitter.
Sweet and fruity, with a slight prickle of carbon dioxide and bright flavors of pineapple and tangerine. Fresh and clean, but drink up.
This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Sangiovese opens with plush layers of cherry and blackberry and touches of spice and toast that are never overdone. In fact, the wine shows power and determination allied to delicacy.
A lighter style Zinfandel, it's also lighter in color. Aromas align more with fresh minerality than deep fruit, though there is tobacco, plum jam and some pepper on the nose. Once sipped, cranberry and pomegranate compete for the fruit side, while cedar and pepper form the spice element. It's great for sipping on the porch and shows how Zinfandel can be impressively lean, even with 14.7% alcohol.
Classic old-school Gran Reserva. The nose is full of barbecue, molasses and dried plum, while the palate has complexities in the form of tobacco, tire rubber and earth. It goes somewhat citrusy and quick on the finish, ending in a wash of orange-infused leather and chocolate. Drink now or hold for another 5 years.
Nature seems to have condemned California Barbera to be a rustic, hard wine, at best and this is a prime example of the species. Black in color and very tannic, it shows ripe berry and coffee flavors accented with peppery spice. These wines live forever, without gaining much complexity, so best now through 2020.
Montée de Tonnerre, just to the south of the Grand Cru slope, gives rich wines like this with density and ripeness. From the warm vintage of 2013, this is a ripe, apple- and pear-flavored wine that has just the hint of a tighter, mineral texture. It can be drunk now.
Nicely done in an Alsatian style, this Pinot Gris has subtle aromatics that blossom in due time into lemon, pear and tart apple, the whole richly layered and ideal for pairing with rich wintertime foods.
This budget-priced Syrah is lean and peppery, with plenty of color and tannin. There are simple flavors of red currants, supported with lightly earthy tannins and proportionate acids.
Stainless steel fermentation has yielded a yeasty, beery wine. There's plenty of fruit, a bit too reminiscent of canned peaches, and a finish that seems constricted and short. Residual sugar is right around 2%.
Bringing out the ripe fruits of the vintage, this is soft, rich and sweet in character. Acidity accompanies the flavors of red berry and red cherry. From Quinta do Cachão and other Messias vineyards, this is soft and developing quickly.
With a metallic aroma that follows through to the palate, this tight wine is all about texture and not much about fruit. Mineral and concentrated, it might round out, but is always likely to be firm in character.
Tasted in early spring, this Chard was still tingly with acidity, but by the time you read this, everything should have calmed down. It's terrifically ripe with green apple, nectarine and tropical fruit flavors that are so rich, you won't even miss the oak.
Apex has just released this 2002, which makes it, as far as we know, the last of that vintage to see daylight. Dark and smoky, it is already heading into more mature, secondary fruit flavors, and has a pleasing softness throughout. Time has sanded away the rough edges of the tannins, and rounded out the herbal components as well. This is drinking very nicely, and gives you a cellared wine at a new wine price.
We all wonder if those cult Cabs will age, but there's no doubt that this is a cellar guarantee. Cathy Corison makes her Cabs less ripe than many others, so the alcohol is lower and the acids and tannins are harder and drier. That's in youth. But such is the depth of cherry, blackberry, cassis, cedar and mineral flavors and overall balance that this complex young wine should easily negotiate the next 15 years.
While it has sufficient tannin, the wine also has a feeling of generous black currant and berry fruits. It's dry with considerable concentration, but it's future looks good, so keep for 5–6 years.
This wine's sharply etched, bright pineapple and underripe peach flavors gain depth from aging in 13% new French oak. A touch of honeyed apple and butterscotch lingers on the finish. Drink now through 2022.
Hard, rubbery, leathery aromas are balanced off by black-fruit scents. This is tight on the palate, with condensed flavors of berry, plum and minty herbs. The finish holds onto that herbal character while showing solidity and adequate structure.
Merlot is one of the benchmark wines at this winery, wholly-owned by the Osoyoos Indians. Roasted aromas of plum and cherry don't entirely disguise a bit of funk. A year in mixed oak adds flavors of mocha and dark chocolate to rather thin fruit.
This Livermore producer has sourced from Livermore and Amador County—both Portuguese varieties and Cabernet Sauvignon—to make this Port-style wine, a mouthful of caramel toffee melted and toasty. A hint of marshmallow's there too.
A splendid Chardonnay, rich, vital and elegant, with so many layers of interest. Framed by a cut of brilliant acidity, it evolves with complex flavors of citrus and tropical fruits, minerals, flowers and honey, then finishes long and savory in a swirl of spices. Oak adds the perfect touch of buttered toast, while the wine is a study in the creamy effect of sur lie aging. It's perfectly dry on the finish.
Delicate and kind of ethereal at first, but seems to grow a spine the longer it sits in the glass. Aromas are of talc, vanilla and citrus; the palate feel reprises the dusty-talcy impression. A dry twist of lemon drop on the finish completes a very pretty picture. Imported by Cumulus Wines Inc.
Inviting macerated strawberry aromas mix with light plum, pink peach flesh and the original Hubba Bubba bubblegum scent. The delicious palate is driven by a subtle sense of cotton candy, all cut with a lime peel acidity.
Light and clean, with dust, toast, raspberry and flowery notes to the bouquet. Fresh and properly round in the mouth, with a lot of red fruit and length. Bright, lifted and likable on the finish, with good flow. Better than most rosé Cavas.
The complex, seductive nose promises a bit more than the palate delivers. Nonetheless, there is good complexity and a moderately long, if somewhat watery, finish. The slight residual sugar will make this a good choice with drier Asian dishes. Drink now.
Alluring aromas of exotic spice, purple flower, dark-skinned berry and a balsamic note lead the nose. The concentrated palate delivers dried cherry, ripe plum, mint, licorice and a hint of game alongside velvety tannins that wrap around the finish. It nicely balances weight and finesse.
With fresh, jammy blackberry and cherry fruit, this Cab tastes like it's right out of the fermenting tank. It's bright in acidity and simple, but gets the job done.
The structure and pedigree of this fine wine are immediately apparent. It hits the mouth with a wonderful balance of ripe fruit, fine tannins, firm acidity and perfectly integrated oak. The deep flavors of blackberry jam spread onto buttered toast, and drizzled with anise liqueur and melted chocolate, are irresistable. But the tannins are still hard. Decant now for a few hours, or drink through 2014.
Perfumed, substantial and potent, this shows the typical varietal flavors of orange peel and citrus fruits, with noticeable heat in the finish.
Full and rich, this has intense, ripe black-plum fruit, with layers of wood aging that give the wine a dry, firm character. The Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend give it tannic structure and concentrated juiciness. Age this for at least six years.
This is a featherlight red, full of berries and bright acidity, but with a texture that just coats the palate. This is one of those rare reds that works as an apéritif, fresh, clean and fruity. Screwcap.
In a lighter style than other Grüners in the single-vineyard range, this comes from a gravel and loess vineyard close to the Schloss. The wine is fresh, erring on crisp, emphasizing the green and spice Grüner flavors. The aftertaste brings out the acidity.
Pickled on the nose, with aromas that hint at white grapes such as Verdejo. This is jumpy and unsettled, with citrus and white grapefruit flavors leaving a tangy burn on the finish. Jangled and sharp.
This is a pretty wine, forward and fruit-driven, with orange-juice highlights around cherry fruit. It's as fresh and flavorful as a Cru Beaujolais, ready for immediate enjoyment and best consumed sometime this decade.
Very creamy mousse leads to a tight wine with raspberry flavors and considerable acidity. That makes the wine very fresh, crisp, clean with an attractive final fragrance. It's ready to drink but could have a few months' bottle age.
There's been a lot of griping lately about overly ripe, too-soft, high-alcohol Cabs that cost too much. This Cab is just the opposite. Crisp and structured, with a gritty mouthfeel (in a good sense) and only 13.8% alcohol, it's bone-dry, with rich flavors of red and black currants. Lovely with a wide range of foods.
This is the quintessential red meat wine that delivers plump aromas of dark berry, leather, spice and black pepper. There's a touch of jammy fruit in the mouth but enough acidity to break through succulent cuts of lamb or beef.
A relatively soft entry, tart plum fruit, simple berry flavors and a hint of burnt toast. There is a slight burn also in the finish, that reflects the near-15% alcohol. A little chocolaty film wraps the tannins.
Spring Valley continues to evolve under Ste. Michelle ownership. The latest Muleskinner Merlot sports a $10 price increase, but production has been cut in half. The high alcohol (15.1%) and massive scale remain; this is pure, estate-grown Merlot on steroids. The plum and cassis flavors are deeply streaked with earth, dried leaf, and sweet tobacco.
This is a heavy wine with an earthy, almost stewed-smelling nose that is defined by raisin and prune aromas. It feels grabby on the palate, with chunky, blocky berry and prune flavors. This musclebound Malbec finishes rubbery and ripe.
Sonoma Valley Cabernet specialist Cohn reaches to the Russian River to expand his portfolio with this Pinot Noir. It's not a stretch to call it Bordeaux-style. Although it has the variety's telltale silkiness and medium body, the blackberry, cola, coffee, leather and oak flavors, not to mention the tannins, possess density and gravity, which may make this wine ageable. Best now through 2011.
There's a hint of menthol and an overall medicinal streak to the black cherry and berry fruit on the nose, but the palate lacks that characteristic. Rather, mature notes of pepper, leather and smoke dominate. Medium weight with fine but firm tannins.
Aromas of hazelnut, orchard fruit and a confectionary note lead the nose. The bright palate offers crisp green apple and lemon drop alongside zesty acidity that leaves a tangy finish.
Here's a lusty, fruity Zin to drink with barbecue and roasts. Rich in blackberries, cherries, blueberries, caramel, vanilla and spice flavors that finish glyceriney-sweet.
This shows real Chardonnay character with its pure, crisp essence of lime and orange that marks this smoky, slightly sweet bubbly. It's a little rough around the edges, but fine for drinking now.
Arguably one of the best value wines from Italy this year, this has beautifully intense aromas of jasmine, honey and exotic fruit. It's simple and well made, with a sweet softness and a fruity succulence on the finish.
Decent, but unbalanced. Shows nice aromas of citrus, gooseberry and vanilla, but then turns frankly sweet in the mouth, with sugary flavors of lemonade and pineapple juice.
A flawed wine, not undrinkable but not very pleasant. It has a Porty smell and tastes sweet and simple. The alcohol is 15.8%.
Perhaps less nuanced than the Sorì Tildìn, but more powerful, with round, mouthfilling flavors and firm tannins. Hints of tobacco and vanilla add complexity to rich plum and black cherry notes, finshing with a lovely touch of anise. Drink 2015–2030 and beyond.
Still wrapped up tight, as are most of the 2014s from Elk Cove, this offers juicy fruit flavors of pomegranate and raspberry, supported by fresh acidity that promises some years of aging potential. This harmonious, flavorful wine should be drunk from 2018–2030.
This is a rich, maturing wine that is full of toasty, yeasty flavors that are finely integrated with the orange zest and apple flavors. It is just right to drink now, at a midway point between youth and maturity but it will age for several more years. Drink until 2020.
Spiced berry and plum aromas are holding in there. This is blatantly acidic and citric, with cranberry and raspberry flavors that finish tart before falling off.
This wine opens in classically delicate characteristics of clove and cedar, as expressive as a forest floor. It then unveils a combination of red and black plum deftly sifted through soft layers of integrated oak and tannin.
Aged in a mixture of new French (80%) and American oak, this leads with barrel notes of woodspice followed by herbs, brown stems, blue fruit and cinnamon. It shows good concentration with quite tart acids and dry, chalky tannins.
Named after the almost gold appearance of the Chardonnay vines at harvest time, this is a soft wine, with hints of the mineral tang that embodies Pouilly Fuissé. It has pear and white peach fruit flavors, soft and ready to drink.
Harsh and sharp in tannins and acids, but this is a pretty good price for a dry, full-bodied red wine with blackberry and currant flavors. Drink with rustic fare, such as burgers or pasta with sausages.
This full-bodied and smooth-textured wine has subtle aromas like cinnamon, mint and raspberry. Bold flavors recall ripe plums and dried cherries. A soft mouthfeel is partly due to light tannins.
Loamy, earthy aromas of raspberry and raisin fall flat as this breathes. A heavy palate is low on freshness and acidity, while prune, cherry and cassis flavors veer toward raisin on a finish that quickly loses clarity and snap.
This traditional blend of 36% Merlot, 34% Cabernet Sauvignon, 19% Cabernet Franc, 7% Petit Verdot and 4% Malbec offers the expected aromas of cedar, plums, tobacco, cracked pepper and slight mint. It's very easy on the palate, with boysenberries and a woody complexity, proving light and tasty.
Shows the usual Williams Selyem Chardonnay profile of huge fruit and flashy oak. This opulent wine would be over-the-top except that it's balanced by crisp, lemony acidity, and somehow retains a tight core with a gravitational tug that keeps the richness focused. Impressive now for sheer power, and should hold well for another 5–6 years.
From a warm appellation, a rugged, earthy wine with some distinctly raisiny notes. It's very soft and round, with a low-acid, velvety mouthfeel and outsized fruit. The finish is a bit sweet and Port-like.
For Peg Bay's high-end bottling, this is a bit of a disappointment. It offers dried spices and cherries on the nose, then adds sour cherry flavors on the palate. With time, darker cherry flavors emerge, showing a slight element of sur-maturité. It's medium-bodied, with some firm tannins still in evidence. Hold through 2008 and hope for improvement. Imported by Meadowbank Estates.
Awkward, with sweet-and-sour Chinese food flavors. Now it's cherries, then it's balsamic. Finishes sugary sweet.
Winter spices like cinnamon, clove and nutmeg waft from this full-bodied and complex wine, joining gentle black-cherry flavors on the palate. The texture is smooth and caressing, and its richness lingers on the finish.
Bright, tart candied cherry aromas are dusted with saddle leather and cinnamon. Light-bodied; gets tarter on the finish, where the fruit becomes more cranberryish.
Wow. An incredible (and affordable) example of what Mourvèdre can be in certain nooks and crannies of the Sierra Foothills and in certain hands. Here winemaker and owner Hank Beckmeyer has made a silk mountai wine out of a tough vintage, taking organically farmed Mourvèdre from the folks over at Cedarville (who have their own label too) and made a gorgeous, pure and rich Rhône with perfumed notes of plum, smooth spice and a good dose of earth, all easy on the palate with fresh acidity and a velvety texture. Very little sulfur was used.
Made from 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Feteasca Neagra, this wine has a bright nose of black cherry and dark plum with just a whiff of mint. Flavors of blackberry and plum are joined in the mouth by a sophisticated touch of tobacco leaf that recedes with the arrival of the zesty finish.
This is a cool-climate Chardonnay that's dark gold in color and tastes of ripe apple. From both the Ferrington and Savoy Vineyards, two of Anderson Valley's finest, it shows the greatness of the vintage in coastal Mendocino. Fragrant and rich in honey and toasty notes, it finishes crisp. Crab cakes with it would be ideal.
The name references a type of soil. The flavors combine red berries and a whiff of mushroom, along with spice, orange peel and citrus. The wine seems to tighten up through the midpalate, which leaves the finish feeling a bit restrained. Try giving it a good long decanting, or cellar till 2020.
The fog reached a little too far into the vineyard in 2010, judging from this less-than-fully-ripe Pinot Noir. Although it has some decent cherry fruit, it lacks fruity richness, which makes the acidity stick out.
This is yet another plump, sweaty smelling Sauvignon Blanc from this producer. This vintage is fat in the mouth but kept alive by adequate young acidity. Salty, briny flavors of citrus, particularly grapefruit, end in similar briny fashion.
Time to rock with this new, lightly oaked cuvée from Esclans, a fresh, bright, full wine with forward fruit. Despite its alcohol, the wine has a light touch with a hint of pepper and rounded red fruits making it ideal for food. The wine will be best to drink from late 2016.
Plum and cherry aromas carry a lemony oak note. This is fresh but rubbery, as you might expect from a young Monastrell-Petit Verdot blend. Plenty of black currant and plum fruit is supported by mild toasty bitterness on the finish.
This soft, round and fruity wine is styled for immediate consumption. Light fruit flavors of apple and Asian pear are finished with a lick of lemony acid.
91-93 Barrel sample. There is a good structure to go with the rich fruit and intense ripeness. The acidity compensates for the slight burn of alcohol.
This single vineyard wine comes from a steep parcel that is wedged between crus Fleurie and Moulin-à-Vent. It is deliciously packed with crisp cherry fruits and fine acidity. At the same time, it is structured, solid and with a core of tannins. It is a wine that will age for a while longer, so drink from late 2017.
A savory blend of 95% Nebbiolo and 5% Vespolina, this opens with lovely scents of fragrant purple flower, tilled soil, woodland berry, dark spice, new leather and a whiff of chopped herb. The polished palate offers mouthwatering black cherry, crushed raspberry, baking spice and star anise framed in firm, elegant tannins. Drink 2017–2024.
Here's a fruitfocused Shiraz that puts forward just what one would expect: red cherry and plum fruit flavors backed by hints of black pepper and game. The fine tannins and medium body produce an overall structure that's approachable now.
A rich, smooth, sweet wine, full of caramel and almonds, with just a hint of acidity. The spirit edge gives the right bite in this mature, rounded, delicious tawny.
Il Sestante is a fresh and dense wine with good concentration and bright aromas of cherry, chocolate and dried prune. This Ripasso is soft and plush with a hint of sharp acidity to keep it all in focus.
This Bordeaux-style blend is inky, reduced and heavily oaked up front, with aromas of sawdust, vanilla and jammy black fruits. Interestingly, it is somewhat sharp and shrill on the palate, with lively acidity. Flavors of raw oak, coconut, vanilla and blackberry finish savory and briny, with shearing acids and choppy tannins. Drink through 2019.
Warm, rubbery berry aromas mixed with smoked meat and herbal accents make for a solid nose, and while the palate has clampy acidity and herbal notes, there's ample body, roundness and berry fruit to bring it home. Both leafy and candied on the finish.
Bright, clean flavors of cranberry and strawberry make this dry rosé easy on the palate and the wallet. There's a fruity kick on the nose followed by a dry but flavorful wave of flavors that seem perfect for a picnic or summertime sip under flapping sails. Pair this with seafood or poultry or experiment a little—its refreshing, crisp quality will play well with most foods.
The palest pink in color, this wine has a crisp texture but not much fruitiness. It is light with a touch of perfumed acidity. Drink now.
Made from Cortese grapes from northern Italy, this bright and easy white wine offers drying mineral notes that frame a solid core of yellow fruit and citrus. The wine is light, lean and washes down beautifully.
Clean, dry and fruity, an easy drinking wine with cherry and oak flavors that will go with a wide variety of food.
Fritz has made tremendous progress with Cab over the years, and their '05 represents an exciting new step. It's true to the variety, a smoothly dry, tannic wine that brims with currants, cherries and cocoa. Yet it showcases the brambly, briary, peppery notes you find in the best Dry Creek Valley Cabs.
Shows all the hallmarks of a fine young Petite Sirah. Dry and full-bodied, it's a tannic, acidic wine in its youth, packed with muscular black currant, coffee, caramel and spicy chocolate flavors. Fans of the variety will love its typicity, and if you're into aging your wines, this should develop for at least 10 years.
Here's a light and easy Chardonnay with clean mineral notes backed by dried hay, sage, stone fruit and honey. The wine has good density and length and ends on a spicy, fresh note.
In its antique bottle, this wine (one of a limited series) is laden with more wood than fruit. It will certainly soften, allowing the black fruits to come through, but this amount of wood will be hard to balance out. Drink from 2020.
Here is a lightly sweet, fresh wine that has crisp red-currant and raspberry flavors. It's bright, clean and ready to drink now.
A consistent winner, this single-vineyard Chardonnay is barrel fermented in 100% new French oak, using wild yeast. The scents and flavors are exceptionally detailed, running from fresh clover into tree fruit, yeast and lots of toast. It has structure, grip and length.
Tart cherry meets with woody charred-cedar spice, dried earth and crushed rocks on the nose of this appellation blend. The lightly bodied sip offers flavors that are quite light, with evenly dispersed cherry and gravel.
The clean look, nice bead and good mouthfeel are the saving graces here, because it smells strange, almost like steamed ballpark hot dogs, and it tastes odd and innocuous, like papaya juice. The look and feel are good but the smell and tastes are not so great.
A complex wine that takes time to unveil itself, this offers muted dark cherry and exotic cardamom spice, light and layered through the midpalate before revealing a taste of toasty oak on the finish.
This is one of the driest wines Marimar Estate ever has produced—in a good sense. The cool vintage has made the Chardonnay minerally and sleek, while Albariño brings its usual lemony crispness. The result is a versatile, stylishly elegant wine.
Made from 60% Prokupac and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, this Serbian red blend has warm aromas of brown spices, worn saddle leather, black pepper and red fruits. It's bold on the palate, with flavors of cranberry, spice and pomegranate.
Better known for its red wines, Penfolds has turned out a lovely Bin 51 Riesling in 2007. An alluring nose of orange sherbet and petrol leads into a medium-weight wine that manages to be both broad and mouthcoating and yet long and racy on the finish. May not be a long-lived Riesling by Aussie standards, but it should still drink well over the next 7-10 years.
Gritty and corny on the nose, and frankly it's almost acrid.  Bitter; the only fruit that comes up is banana.
Way too much residual sugar in this wine, to judge by the white-sugary finish. It's clean and fruity wine, but really should be labeled off-dry or even sweet.
Floral notes play about the tart berry fruit of this harmonious and generously fruited fizz. The palate is exuberant with lively red-berry fruit while creamy notes of biscuit and oatmeal provide a wonderful balance. This is fresh and frothy, creamy and utterly irresistible. The lasting finish is wonderfully dry.
Aromas of wild herbs, dry brush, rubber, oak and berry fruits come prior to a pointed palate with high acidity and choppy tannins. Flavors of creamy oak support racier currant and red-plum notes, while this Carignan-Garnacha-Syrah blend tastes oaky, spicy and thorough on the finish. Drink through 2021.
Good price for a Merlot this tasty. It's softly tannic and juicy, rich and fat in black cherry pie, bacon and toast flavors. A versatile full-bodied red wine for drinking now.
A medium sweet wine, it is full of ripe tropical fruits. It has a rounded texture, generous and opulent in feel with an intense, concentrated structure. Spicy and warm, it needs several years to rdevelop. Drink from 2016.
This wine opens with aromas of leather, old spice and candied fruit that seem past their prime. There's a sour note on the finish.

Impeccably fresh and dry, this wine smells like crisp apple skin and white peaches, and tastes vivid and refreshing, while combining light alcohol with a substantial and smooth texture.
Soft, dull and vegetal. Still, it's drinkable for some modest cola flavors and velvety mouthfeel.
Full bodied yet fresh and lively at the same time, this is an opulent white Hermitage that should make for delicious early drinking. Orange marmalade and honey notes are complemented by hints of truffle, adding an exotic edge. Drink it over the next few years.
Rich but over-worked, with a heavy application of oak, giving dominating aromas and flavors of caramel, buttered toast and vanilla. Underneath is a crisp Chardonnay with pineapple, Asian pear and green apple fruit. Drink now.

Florally pungent, with sweet peach and apricot notes, this smells great. It's richly textured and balanced.
Exuberantly fragrant of ripe, tropical fruit and florals, this Romanian white blend veers towards confected, but it's pleasantly brisk and apple-y on the palate. A good apéritif for casual, weekday enjoyment.
This expression of Nero d'Avola paints a rosy picture of the future of this indigenous variety and Sicilian winemaking in general. Aged in large casks and cement, this is elegant and fine, with an extremely polished texture. The finish is marked by a note of dried berry fruit, plus warm, earthy tones of leather and dried spice.
A beautiful, elegant and dramatic blend for drinking now and over the next 6–10 years. Based on Cabernet, and sourced from vineyards including Beckstoffer ToKalon and Showket, it's flashy in blackberry, blueberry and cassis flavors, with gorgeous, refined tannins. It's throwing some tannins, so you might want to give it a proper decant.
Mossy, foresty aromas are rugged and settle into blackberry. An intense, pushy palate is woody in feel, with hot, minty, oaky black-fruit flavors that improve with airing. Heat and toasty notes rise up on the finish of this bold Mendoza Malbec, a first from San Pedro (Chile).
The Bric Turot expression delivers sweet aromas of mature berry fruit, spice, mocha, nutmeg and cedar. The generous mouthfeel is round and plush with velvety impressions of melted chocolate and creamy vanilla. Drink after 2010.

Aromas of underbrush, baked earth, cedar and a whiff of game lead the nose. The palate offers dried black cherry, anise, black pepper and grilled sage alongside brooding tannins. It's a bit rustic but has an earthy appeal. Drink through 2019.
You'd be hard-pressed to find another Oregon producer with both Tannat and Zinfandel. Troon does them well. Dark and bloody, this pure varietal bottling mingles brambly berries with road tar and some chewy tannins. It's a perfect everyday red for the onset of cold weather.
Brambly blackberry and forest fruit aromas fill the bouquet, with secondary notes of licorice, bark and sweet spice lingering in the background. The medium-weight, structured mouth shows more skin-driven black-fruit flavors alongside gripping tannins and a solid finish.
A sweet mix of Touriga Nacional, Tinta Cão, Souzão and Tinta Barroca that smells of melted chocolate over strawberries. The alcohol overwhelms the fruit's charm and makes it hard to discern the care that was taken in putting such grapes together.
This is a really refreshing, crisp and fruity wine. It achieves a good balance between acidity and lively red berries and lime juice. The wine dances brightly in the glass and would make a good apéritif.
There's something not right about the way this winery is fermenting its Cavas because both this and Oriol Rossell's regular brut are excessively foamy. As a result, this gran reserva's apple and spice aromas and flavors are rendered moot by the gaseous explosion that occurs when liquid hits palate.
Opens with a stunning layered, bouquet of dried fruits, sandalwood, flowers, smoke and ginger. It's full on the tongue, with rich pear and apple flavors, toast and yeast accents. Citrus and mineral notes persist on the lengthy finish of this impressively complex bottling. Sourced from seven grand cru villages, this is superb now and will last a very long time.
Cherry, plum and oak aromas are more subtle than forced. This is mostly Syrah and Carignan, with some Cab Franc and Petit Verdot. Dark, peppery, toasty black-fruit flavors finish full and grabby, with notes of cassis, herbs and spice. Drink through 2018.

All estate grown, this blend is roughly half and half Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, with a splash of Sangiovese. Dark and fruity, it opens generously with flavors of black cherry, cassis and a hint of cola, finishing with lick of dark chocolate. A mix of French, Hungarian and American oak—24% new—was used.
This is an interesting but not perfectly balanced rosé from the celebrated Irpinia area of Campania in southern Italy. The nose of this pretty, pale pink wine opens with sweet aromas of berries and roses. But the mouthfeel shows sharp sourness.
This smells heavily of grape skins, and tastes like golden raisins. The texture is slightly fizzy and very thick, and the flavors are very sweet.
Light honey on red apple and apple blossom aromas show on this blend of 42% Viognier, 30% Grenache Blanc, 23% Marsanne and 5% Roussanne. The flavors combine honey brittle with lemon skins, ripe Borsch pear and a warmer yellow melon fruit element.
A soft and easy selection, this Chenin provides a round but balanced palate brimming with refreshing notes of melon, citrus pith and green apple. A hint of toast is revealed after swallow; drink up now.
Honeyed and viscous—this practically pours like syrup—this is a rich dessert wine, filled with flavors of dried apricots and ultraripe peaches. It's long and sugary on the finish, just lacks a bit of acid balance, and while the hints of caramelized nuts may add complexity, they could also be a hint of oxidation. Drink now, in small doses.
The wine is ripe, rounded and with fine rich fruit. Its structure is balanced with the blackberry fruits, giving density as well as fine acidity. Drink this well-made wine from 2018.
Too dark and heavy for a blush wine, with jammy flavors of cherries, vanilla and spices. Lacks lightness and intricacy.
This blend of 52% Syrah, 25% Grenache and 23% Mourvèdre is quite sultry on the nose, with crushed boysenberry, dried violets, wet clay and the slightest touch of soy. Pepper and moist earth arise on the palate, alongside blackberry and blueberry fruit, a touch of cocoa and concentrated lavender and other purple-flower flavors.
Savory whiffs of lemongrass and tilled earth turn surprisingly floral and fruity on the palate of this complex yet quaffable spätlese. Sweet, sun-kissed tangerine and peach flavors are unctuous and satisfying, off set by zesty lime acidity. The finish is long, peppered by notes of pollen, herb and fennel.
You'll be surprised how much richness there is here. Oodles of sweet black cherry fruit, with a hint of oak, and it's all dry and crisp. Thank the grape glut for this incredible value.
In this intriguing blend, the herbaceous Sauvignon Blanc dominates the smoother Chardonnay. The wine is all about crispness and freshness with a strongly aromatic component. Acidity and a touch of minerality come through at the end.
Minty and green, with pronounced gooseberry and feline scent aromas and flavors. This bone-dry, acidic wine needs rich food for balance, like goat cheese.
This pale-colored get by with standard aromas of stone fruit, kiwi and passion fruit. Easy-to-drink and decidedly uncomplicated, it offers simple, fruit-driven flavors.
In general O. Fournier gets it right, be it in Spain or Argentina. But this Ribera del Duero struggles from the outset. It's rubbery, damp and lacks clarity of fruit. And the feel is sharp and lemony, seemingly a combo of excessive oak and raw fruit. Imported by Fine Wines from Spain.
A rich, ripe wine and full in the mouth yet still developing. It has weight, fine spiciness and tropical fruit flavors with just a hint of honey to balance its dryness. Full-bodied while stylish. Keep for 2–3 years.
Baking spice and toasted wood add warmth to preserved black cherry and plum flavors in this bold, lushly textured Cabernet Franc. The tannins are quite soft, but the dense fruit profile gives it weight and body.
89-91  Dryness and structure dominate this wine. But there is good potential, it has layers of botrytis, which are good, and there is richness under the structure.
Coming from a reliable vineyard in the Los Alamos Valley, this wine presents aromas of dried violet, blackberry, leather and espresso. Brooding dried-cherry fruit directs the palate, which benefits further from roasted game and crushed oregano and thyme. The tannins are still prominent.
Roasted meats, dried herbs and plummy fruits show on the nose of this bottling, which presents a more old-California take on Petite Sirah. The palate is lighter weight than usual for the grape, delivering minty herbs more than the dried red fruits.
Ripe and forward, this brings brambly berry fruit and plenty of Dr Pepper soda flavors front and center. It's a smooth ride to a quick finish. Both scents and flavors show a hint of pine needle.
Heady notes of ripe pear and chalky stone entice on the nose. The dry, focused palate adds aromatic spice, some white pepper too, and glides along a faultline of pure, fresh acidity. Beautifully integrated, the elements of pear and citrus zest complement each other for grown-up, sustained fun.
A mere hint of citrus touches the nose. The palate is both light, easy and enlivening. The lovely purity of white pears and fresh citrus shines through.
A mineral, tense wine, packed with delicious citrus fruits, a taut chalky structure and green apple acidity. It has a salty aftertaste to it.
Opens with sweet milk chocolate and candied aromas that don't seem totally natural. Feels drawn down, with standard red berry flavors that get lost rather quickly. Finishes juicy and forward, with acidity balancing off some leftover oak.
This fresh and luminous Roero Arneis will drink well with appetizers or easy vegetarian dishes for the next two years or so. The wine opens with a delicate golden color and aromas of white flower, citrus and stone fruit.
Subdued aromas recall dried woodland berry, mint and a whiff of culinary spice. The juicy, straightforward palate offers raspberry, ripe cherry, clove and a touch of star anise alongside solid but well integrated tannins. Drink through 2019.
A new brand from the PlumpJack folks, and a very promising start. It brings Sancerre-like sophistication and polish to a variety that's usually not very elegant.

The winery is set to release a pair of Cabs in the next few years.
A rather neutral nose precedes a very clean-cut, subtly fruited palate with notions of yellow plum and wonderfully light-footed lemon freshness. The body is toned and slender, yet subtly expressive.
Chalk dust and slate lend a mineral elegance to white blossom, lime and gooseberry notes. The palate is zesty and spry, marked by concentrated hits of sweet stone fruit and citrus flavor.

Riverbench's regular estate Pinot Noir, as opposed to their excellent Mesa reserve, has struggled over the years, and this '09 continues that pattern. It's elegantly structured, but somewhat underripe, with an asparagus edge to the raspberries, cherries and sweet oak.
Obvio means obvious in Spanish, and this is an obvious yet fairly good Malbec. There's some ground spice, cinnamon and a little bretty cheese to the nose, but the palate is solid, and the berry and cherry flavors are correct for the variety. Best by the glass or in casual settings.
This medium-bodied wine smells light and herbal. It gets deeper and richer on the palate as ripe golden-apple flavors kick in and the texture seems to spread out.
A lightly orange-colored rosé that is made by macerating the grapes on the skins for 72 hours. The result is a soft wine, very dry while also showing a rounded character that gives richness. Ripe red fruits and a touch of grapefruit are sustained by a mineral texture. Drink now.
Red licorice candy on the nose is the only sign of life. Otherwise it's just sour and dried-out, with flavors of citrus and plum skins. Past its prime.
Made in a wonderfully dry, crisp style, Sauvignon Blancs like this fill a much-needed niche in fruit-heavy California. It's zesty and minerally, with lemon, lime and grapefruit flavors. Beautiful as a cocktail sipper, or with the perfect roast chicken.
Caramel and soft berry fruits characterize this pleasant and fresh wine. It has flavors of red berries along with vanilla  to round it out. Easy Pinot, drink now.
Strong scents and flavors of oak and spice mask the fruit. It feels a bit flat on the palate, as if heading toward early oxidation. The oak and butterscotch flavors carry through onto the finish. Two bottles tasted.
Thin and simple, with unripe vegetal and twiggy flavors, but at least the label is lots of fun.
Light and floral, this is a complex, well-integrated Chardonnay that's bursting in just-sliced pineapple, with a layering of butterscotch and caramel. It's richly textured yet nicely balanced between savory and sweet. The acidity upholds the wine from entering into dense territory, a celebration of one heck of a sunny vintage in a glass.
Mostly Merlot, this powerful wine delivers Red Mountain grip and guts. The generous bourbon barrel accents from oak aging are balanced by the concentrated fig, plum and blackberry fruit. A seam of graphite runs through the tannins.
This appellation blend performs as well as the single-vineyard expressions by the same vintner (at least early in the wine's life). From Adam Lee, this bottling offers fresh blackberry, violet, lilac, lavender, charcoal, beef and white pepper on the nose. The palate is full of peppery, boysenberry-juice flavors, wrapped in an engaging texture.
Here's a bright and bold Brunello with loads of ripe cherry, inky density and a beautifully polished feel with crushed mineral and wet river stone elements. It's a truly beautiful wine with stunning purity and intensity. All elements are balanced—from the fruit, to the spice, to the ethereal balsam notes. The mouthfeel is lively and intense and the finish is packed with berry, almond and savory persistence. Age 10–15 years.
Aged for nine months in used and new wood, this wine is rich and smooth. Its acidity and blackberry fruit are balanced and ripe while staying crisp and tight on the mineral-laced finish. Ready to drink.
This Romanian Chardonnay has a perfumed nose of vanilla, white flowers and ripe banana. It is medium bodied with flavors of papaya, guava, mango and honeydew melon.
Scorched earth, underbrush, blue flower and woodland berry are some of the scents you'll find on this focused wine. The elegant, full-bodied palate delivers black raspberry, mature cherry, brown kitchen spice and a hint of leather alongside tightly wound but refined tannins. Drink 2016–2021.
Vibrant and elegant, this radiant sparkler has enticing aromas of wild flower, apple, graphite, Alpine herb and a whiff of bread crust. The fresh linear palate delivers ripe pear, nectarine, mineral and a hint of toasted almond alongside lively acidity. The bone-dry finish closes crisp and clean.
An earthy, spicy aroma and gutsy flavors that are more meaty and herbaceous than fruity seem just right in this full-bodied, richly flavored and satisfying wine. It conveys a distinctive fun, funky personality.
Packaged in a modern screwcap bottle, this friendly blend of Ribolla Gialla with smaller percentages of Friulano and Riesling delivers a bright golden color and lively fruit aromas of stone and passion fruits. The wine is crisp and lively in the mouth and perfectly captures the spirit of winemaking in Northeast Italy.
A little gritty in texture, and the rawness is compounded by black pepper tartness. Yet there's a huge, succulent core of black cherry fruit, and the wine is perfectly dry and acidic. An interesting Pinot, one to stash in the cellar and see what happens.
A vigorous, masculine Pinot Noir. Dark in color, tannic and acidic, it has the weight of Grenache, although with silkier tannins. The flavors are impressively ripe and deep, suggesting raspberries, cherries, currants and a baked pie crust quality from oak. A bit ponderous now. Give it a good, long decant, or hold for up to six years.
A very ripe wine that holds its freshness at the same time. It has weight, concentration, the wood only showing through gently and finally. For aging.
A dusty, cinnamon-inflected Syrah bursting with blackberries. Persistent flavors play across the palate, with a streak of citrus showing the underlying acidity.
As rich, ripe and flashy as any Pinot Noir out there. It floods the mouth with jammy raspberries and cherries, with smoky oak sweetness like pie crust, sprinkled with cinnamon and brown sugar. Drink soon.
A disappointing release, with tired white-fruit aromas and slightly confected, rubbery flavors. It's a traditional sparkling blend of Pinot Noir, Chardonnay and Pinot Meunier.
Textbook Napa Cab. It's dry, smoothly tannic and subtle, with blackberry, cassis and dark chocolate flavors nicely intrigued with herbs, tobacco and cedar. Just delicious now and for the next few years.
Scents of brambly berry and forest floor mingle with accents of licorice, blackberry and mocha on the nose of this solid wine. It's medium in weight, with fine but slightly gripping tannins that yield a satiny structure around the ripe black-fruit flavors.
90-92 Barrel sample. Concentration and ripe fruit, but with a definite structure that shows as considerable depth of fruit and structure.
There aren't a lot of producers making this variety in America, let alone a Zinfandel and Rhone-wine specialist, but it works on every level, the wine offering a concentration of rich apple, pear and stone fruit, the texture rounded and complex.
At only 10% Syrah, this is quite different in composition from most of Delas's wines. The rest is Grenache, and in 2009 the result is slightly pruny, with touches of coffee, chocolate and Christmas spice. It's full bodied and creamy in texture without being soft, thanks to the crisp acids and silky tannins on the finish. Drink it over the next few years.
Powerful, with concentrated tannins, this bottle remains a tough proposition. Its acidity suggests some fruitiness, though the structure is lacking real flesh. This will obviously round out, but could well be a firm wine for many years.
This is a well-crafted wine that's dense and delicious in juicy red fruit, black currant, licorice and nutmeg. With much of the fruit sourced from the Alexander Valley, this wine shows a managed level of ripeness and oak aging. Structured and lengthy on the finish, this is a nicely put-together package.
This blend of Shiraz, Grenache and Mataro is meaty and savory, with spice and leather notes that impart a dark, mysterious character. Sour plum and cola flavors continue the dark theme, buffered by soft tannins. Finishes long. Drink now–2012.
Acrid and heavy on the nose, this is not showing any of Torrontés's floral, lighter qualities. Instead, this wine is slightly chemical and rough, with a blocky, citric palate and a mix of bitter citrus and pithy flavors.
Nero d'Avola and Merlot are blended to produce a ripe, chewy wine with mature fruit flavors. The nose is a bit muddled and dense but the wine offers good succulence and depth.

This blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Merlot opens with aromas of green bell pepper, roasted coffee bean, red currant and cedar. The palate delivers blueberry, black pepper, espresso, toast and herbaceous notes alongside subtle but drying tannins. Drink through 2016.
While packed with ripe berry and cherry flavors, this wine is also well-balanced due to good acidity and firm tannins that buoy the full flavors and give a lively tension in the mouth. Complementary spicy accents from oak come out with each sip.
This vintage of Deliella represents an enormous jump forward in quality and intensity. Nero d'Avola vines grow in chalky soils, create extremely elegant aromas of dark fruit, chocolate, cured meat, toasted pistachio and barbecue spice. In the mouth, the wine is rich, velvety and long lasting.
A fizzy, bubbly wine that is off-dry, very refreshing and fragrant. Soft flavors of apple, grape and even a touch of honey make this a wine that will slip down easy, especially as an apéritif.
Leather saddle wafts from the glass atop ripe cherry, blackberry jam and brown sugar. Tightly wound in tannin and oak, this wine becomes pleasantly juicy on the finish.

This very fairly priced Merlot from the Cosumnes River sub-section of Lodi has a juicy berry roundness that makes it inviting to drink, and softly textured all around. On the long finish is a remarkably vibrant strain of caramel-mocha flavor, and interesting secondary notes that may have developed over time on this 2007 vintage.
Soft and simple, with candied pear, orange, vanilla, honey and buttered toast flavors that finish with a sugary feel.

Concentrated raspberry and brambleberry aromas mix with iron and brown mushrooms on the nose of this wine from a historic vineyard originally planted in 1972.

Ripe and fruity, this has ripe tannin and rich red-berry flavors. It has a solid, firm background of dark tannins that promise good aging.
The first of Morgan's '07 Pinots to be released, this is a full-bodied wine that needs some time in the bottle to mature. Not a lot, maybe a year or two, will allow the cherry, currant, mocha and cedar flavors to integrate with the oak and tannins.
This dark garnet colored Brunello opens with straightforward and uncomplicated aromas of wild berry, spice and leather. This wine also shows a high level of confidence that is seen in its firm tannins, crisp acidity and rich aftertaste of clove and black fruit.
This offers heady aromas of honeysuckle, white stone fruit, dill, hay and a vegetal note that recalls tomato leaf. The tangy palate offers juicy grapefruit, white peach and honeydew melon while mouthwatering salinity provides depth.
This is exactly the kind of unusual red blend that is giving Paso Robles such a good name. Made from Syrah, Petite Sirah and Zinfandel, it's an enormously attractive wine, dry and well-structured and complex. It shows flavors of blackberries and black cherries, currants, smoked meat, olives and cedar, with a slightly funky, Burgundian note of barnyard. Drink now.
Lots of oak on this fresh, young Chard. It's a bit too heavy on the char, toast, vanilla, and woodsap, and not enough about the peaches, pears and pineapples.
Smoky meat and leather aromas match up with briary plum scents. The feel is sheer and tight, while flavors of olive, herbs and blueberry are bolstered by heightened acids. Good in a basic way, but loud and edgy.
From the Mediterranean island of Sardinia, this ruby red exhibits dark concentration and sharp aromas of blackberry, wild berry and sophisticated Asian spice. The wine has a compact, polished nature and tastes chewy and rich thanks to its soft, spicy tannins.
The nose is very shy and almost neutral. The palate does not brim with aroma, either: here is slender clean freshness on a light dry body. Drink soon.
Cherry, cassis, tomato sauce and crushed leaves are the aromas on this rubbery-feeling Carmenère. Spiced cherry flavors don't show much depth or complexity, while this feels dry and tastes lightly oaky on the finish.
Bold and inky, this wine is made from the little-known Casavecchia grape. It opens with notes of bitter chocolate, cherry, blackberry, cured meat and savory crushed peppercorn. There's a slight note of sourness on the finish that is balanced by hints of crushed granite and smoky campfire.
Fits the mold of traditional Rioja Crianza. The nose has oaky warmth and a slight mulchy quality that probably comes from the hot vintage. But it's holding in there with ripe black cherry and berry flavors that are accented by chocolate, vanilla and cola. Has grabby tannins and is ready to go now.
Dusty saffron and pollen notes lend earthiness to this otherwise ripe, fruity Riesling. Yellow peach and apricot flavors are plump and pert, accented by sunny tangerine sweetness. The finish is brisk but clean. Drink now.
With its definite spritz, this is light, just off-dry Vinho Verde. It has vibrant green fruits, although the yeast character is perhaps too dominant.
Though a bit timid on the nose, this example is impressive for its intense tangle of flavors in the mouth, which run from watermelon candy, to raspberry, wet earth, leather and chocolate. A good structure of firm acidity and brawny tannins as well as the moderately long finish suggest this wine will improve with a few years in the cellar. It can also be consumed now alongside hearty fare.
Minerally, oceanic aromas of tangerine and sea air run into a palate that's clear, linear and tangy, with scouring acidity. Flavors of tangerine, lime and passion fruit finish citrusy but not too shearing or pushy. This will go well with shellfish.
It's hard to imagine Pinot Grigio better than this. Fresh, creamy and packed tight with cool-climate aromas of white flower, citrus and fresh peach, the wine pairs beautifully with spicy Thai or Vietnamese dishes.
Clean, lucid and attractive, with spindly tropical fruit aromas that veer toward mango, pineapple and passion fruit. A complete Verdejo with all the hallmarks Rueda is known for: apricot and peach flavors, nice acidity, and a crisp finish.
This is a big, fleshy wine, with evident tannins and acidity that give it bite and structure. The flavors are ripe and pure, suggesting red and black cherry pie filling, with lots of dusty spice and a hint of sweet oak. It will be very nice now and over the next 4–5 years. And with more than 22,000 cases produced, it should be relatively easy to find.
Ripe blackberry with dill and vanilla suggest “classic” Rioja, although it's probably more modern than that. The wine features a full body, thick tannins, roasted berry flavors, molasses and a bit of chocolate. Maybe it's a touch baked and overripe, but it's definitely solid and generous. Drink now.
Savory wisps of smoke and dusty minerals juxtapose exuberantly juicy, sweet yellow peach and nectarine flavors in this crystalline kabinett. Just off-dry on the palate, its refreshing, high-spirited style makes it an excellent apéritif.
For those everyday purposes when you need a dry, balanced and full-bodied red, this is a good choice. It has pleasant flavors of plums, blackberries and spice, with a chocolaty finish.
Mature, ripe aromas of rooty berry fruits mix with tobacco scents on a soft, raisiny nose. This is easygoing in feel, with jammy roundness. Raisin, cocoa and ripe berry flavors finish heady, soft and chocolaty. Drink now.
A wine with wonderful citrus character, the fruit creamy with a great ripe swathe of honey and spice. The Käferberg vineyard, on a granite shoulder with clay topsoil, gives this warm, rich style of wine. Age for at least 3–4 years for a great Grüner Veltliner.
A well-made blend of Spanish and Portuguese red varietals, with the majority Tempranillo, with bright red cherry and cranberry and high acidic tones that's also got a touch of lovely minerality, olive, toffee and vanilla. The 2007 is ready to drink now, a well-balanced easy drinker with great aromatics and not too much tannin.
Held back for five years, but it hasn't done the wine much good. Earthy, with funky aromas. The flavors aren't bad, veering toward blackberries, but it's still pretty tannic.
Pure, clean, polished aromas of cherry, plum and berry are fit and fruity. This has a lot of life and spunky tannins, while flavors of raspberry, plum and wild herbs finish with a hint of brine and easy length. This is a fine Mencía made in a crowd-pleasing style. Drink through 2020.
Plum and cranberry mark the entry into this clone-specific wine, which becomes expansively juicy as it makes its way on the palate. Orange peel, cranberry and cardamom provide an exotic take on the variety, ending in earth and spice.
Smells like grapey berry fruits and violets. Feels clampy and tannic, with a rubbery mouthfeel and oaky, slightly green flavors of blueberry and black currant. Grainy and grabby on the finish.
A gorgeously ripe wine, a product of the warm vineyards of the upper Douro, giving tropical fruit, pineapple and peach. The acidity is there to balance, with its apple skin texture.
This is a Pinot Noir of considerable force. Your first impression is of irrepressible power, with masses of fruit punching through an overlay of tannin and oak. Then the flavors fantail out, suggesting cherries, cola, currants and spices that are rich and complex through the long finish. For all its richness, the wine retains an agreeable delicacy of texture. Comprised of lots selected by winemaker Bob Cabral for this anniversary bottling, it's right up there with Williams Selyem's best 2010 Pinots, and just as ageable. Drink now–2022. The wine is only available as part of a two-pack from the winery for $250; the other bottle is the 2010 Morning Dew Ranch Pinot Noir, from Anderson Valley.
The wood element is important here, but it is based on a firm Cabernet Sauvignon structure, dry but rich tannins. The wine is a great success for the vintage, giving sweetness, ripe fruit that only shows light extraction, and dark plum and berry flavors. The feeling is of polished fruit and wood, rounded but always dense.
This vintage is thick in dusty chocolate, clove and cinnamon tones, with a sage underbite that gives it a wild edge. Soft, approachable tannins provide a crowd-pleasing entry and midpalate, while the finish reveals the wine's full-bodied, riper side.
Cortaccio is a great expression of Tuscan Cabernet Sauvignon. It boasts enticing aromas of black currant and cedar wood accompanied by dark berry, black pepper, tobacco and vanilla flavors with nice depth. It's already enjoyable but hold another few years for more complexity.
A very rich, dramatic, indisputably Napa Cabernet. The fruit is ripe in blackberries and cassis, the tannin structure is vibrant and living, and the oak application is superb. A fashionable Cab that should develop over the next eight years.
New oak dominates the aromas and flavors, with buttered toast, buttered popcorn and caramel overwhelming the underlying fruit, which suggests pineapples and green apples. Although the wine is dry and acidity is fine, the fruit lacks the richness to support the oak.
91—93 Barrel sample. A balanced, structured wine which brings its structure into play with the rich, but fresh fruit. The wine has good acidity, as well as some tense tannins.
A musky perfume note is sultry and exotic in this rich, textured Pinot Grigio, which was fermented on its skins and matured in oak. The fruity palate offers penetrating dried-pear, nut oil and apple flavors, which are layered with citrusy acids and soft, tea-leaf-like tannins that linger on the finish.
This is a big wine both in terms of consistency and alcohol (17%). In fact, it's too big in many respects and it's hard to image what foods can stand up to this power. The wine is redolent of brambly sour notes of earth and forest floor and there's a touch of bitter astringency on the close.
There's a wild, feral quality to this fine Pinot Noir. It has forest flavors of wild mushrooms, thyme, fennel, anise and pine, along with more familiar flavors of red cherries, cola and sandalwood. Elegant and ageable. Now through 2012.
Orange citrus dominates the medium-intense bouquet, but secondary aromas of green apple, melon rind, hard nectarine and a touch of honeysuckle appear upon deeper inhalation. Solidly structured with a vibrant mouth and an apple core flavored finish.
A few years after the vintage, this is showing some nicely developed sous-bois character to go along with its core of black cherry fruit. Some herbal notes add complexity to the long, tart, firm finish. It's good now, but should also hold for another few years at least.
Cofermented with 6% Viognier, this is a perfumed wine with notes of fresh flowers, orange peel, herb and blue fruit. The elegant blue fruit flavors persist, with abundant floral accents.

Ferdi is an innovative expression of Garganega that is partially made with air-dried grapes for extra aromatic intensity and is also aged on the lees for a creamy mouthfeel and texture. Indeed, there is more pulp here and the wine shows pretty mineral notes at the back.
There are a lot of intriguing and unique aromas on the nose of this bottling, from candied pomegranate and wild blueberry to olive, rosewater, cinnamon and carnation. Those deep fruits and exotic spices show on the sip as well, where a tense acidity leads into a tart cherry finish.
A great example of what can be done with Bordeaux-style wines in Hungary. Heady and deep spice and plum aromas are followed by a restrained, elegant mesh of soft fruit and pepper in the mouth. Integrated and poised.
Gold in color, this high-end Viura is cheesy, cidery and dense on the nose. Plump and resiny in feel, it offers woody flavors of baked white fruits. Hailing from a warm vintage, this goes back and forth between ripe, mealy and oaky and tense and nervy. If drinking now, expect more oak than fruit.
This is crisp, clean and fresh in the mouth, with bitter berry and almond aromas. Pair it with soft cheese.

This is a rich wine with the wood aging giving extra complexity and structure. It has cherry, plum and spice flavors, a dark sense that comes from the texture and the minerality. Drink this solid wine from 2014.
Off-dry and slightly sugary, this fruity, candied sipper mixes orange blossom, orange candy and baby aspirin flavors into a concentrated midpalate. Moscato is on fire these days, and this wine will surely please those who love the style.
L'Ardì shows sweet and succulent fruit flavors with plump aromas of red cherry and plum. Dolcetto is a great wine to pair with grilled sausage or pepperoni pizza.
There's plenty of marmalade and preserved-peach sweetness here, but it's calibrated deftly by pulsating acidity on the midpalate. It's delicate and dancing in mouthfeel, but the stalwart finish impresses. Drink now through 2019.
This tremendous 100% varietal wine hails from Oakville and was aged over three years in oak. Juicy red-cherry fruit and a compelling hint of caramel greet the palate, framed by elegant, fine tannins and a subtle minty tone in the background. Balanced and rewarding from start to finish, it has years ahead of it to develop further nuance. Enjoy 2022–2030.
Clumsy and a bit chemical smelling, with a sticky, thick, candied palate housing bug juice berry flavors in front of a medicinal finish. Bulky, sweet and grabby red wine.
Nuanced scents of crushed purple flower petals, forest floor and raw coconut are supported by a fruity backbone of blackberry and raspberry. The lush mouth is ripe and concentrated, with a satiny texture and bold dark-cherry and plum-flesh flavors framed by hints of cocoa. Drink now–2015.
Tastes jammy all the way through, with raspberry and cherry flavors that start and end sweet and sugary. The problem isn't the ripeness, it's the balance and control throughout the palate experience. This Pinot Noir should finish dry but doesn't, which makes it disappointing, especially at this price.
This bottling marks a stylistic shift in labeling for the winery toward more youthful and creative, and the wine is quite tasty, with aromas of deep black cherry and leather, proving pleasantly rustic. The palate is easy to enjoy, if no particularly complex, with lots of blueberry, Concord grape, white pepper and dark chocolate flavors.
As tradition dictates, white string forms the bottle's closure to lock in aromas of exotic fruit, blooming flowers and peachy cream. A slight touch of acidity helps give this wine more structure and staying power.

Here's a big, bold Pinot of tremendous fruity extract. Although It's a bit heavy and soft, it's very delicious, offering waves of cherries, pomegranates and smoked meat, accented with sandalwood. Advances the cause of Pinot Noir grown in this southern Napa Valley region, which is almost in the Carneros.
Showing the richness and structure of the 2010 vintage, this is an opulent wine, full of black fruits. It has a dark structure, smoky bacon flavors and powerful tannins. Ripe and generous, the fruit can cope with this structure. It does need to age, so drink from 2017.
As the name suggests, this fermentation brings in substantial flavors of herb and stem, cloaking its tight blueberry and black cherry fruit in that stiff, tannic robe. Let it breathe for some hours, or better yet decant it well in advance of drinking.
Opens with a strong aroma of smoked meat and bacon, not bad, but indicative of brettanomyces in the winery. In the mouth are flavors of red and black cherries, with a spicy edge of clove.
This soft, rounded wine is ripe with generous pear and melon flavors. It's easy and ready to drink young for its smooth, attractively ripe character.
Blending grapes from around the appellation, this wine is a fine reflection of its structure and minerality. It's rich and full, while keeping plenty of crisp acidity to contrast its creamy texture. It needs to age for another year, so wait until 2018.
Blended with 5% Viognier and aged in a combination of new French oak, neutral oak and stainless steel, this is a full-bodied white that offers a wealth of ripe peach, apricot and key lime flavor.
This is a new winery for me. It was started by a veteran of the wine industry on the business side. Not clear exactly where the grapes come from along the sprawling Central Coast, but they're quite ripe in blackberry jam and licorice flavors, although there's a bite of acidity and tannins for balance. Appeals for its directness. Drink now.
The wine delivers warm tones of mature fruit that are a bit heavy and jammy on the nose. You'll recognize aromas of blackberry marmalade, spice, moist earth and pungent tobacco.
This is very soft and rounded, with a caramel edge. Its warm, ripe mouthfeel is marked by fruity, light acidity and a splash of lime. Screwcap.

Violets, leather and some sweet cookie aromas carry the nose to a ripe, juicy palate that pumps ample amounts of black cherry, chocolate and spice. Balanced nicely and shows a completeness as well as overall harmony. It's 70% Negroamaro and the rest Aglianico.
Young and intense on the nose, where dried black-currant aromas pick up hints of chocolate and espresso. This is full-throttle ripe, with lush fruit, great body, soft tannins and good length on the finish. Drinkable now, but should develop more nuance in another 5 years and last at least until 2015.
The small area of Pez is one of the top sites in Saint-Estèphe, with many highly rated chateaus. This is one. New wood aging shows strongly at this stage, although so does the fruit. That gives a structured wine, firm and also full of blackberry fruit flavors. The future is good for this wine, so drink from 2018.
Charred wood, espresso and thyme aromas lead onto the medium-full palate, which is supported by sturdy tannins. This Syrah would pair well with a pulled-pork hoagie.
A high-toned, brisk Chardonnay, packed with aromas and flavors of minerals, saline, umami, tropical fruit and spices. Feels rich and opulent in the mouth, with fine oak and a touch of leesy cream. A Chardonnay of great craftsmanship.

This is a soft fruity wine with stalky blackberry fruits. Like many wines from the Tejo region it has a light structure that is built around easygoing fruitiness. Drink now.

This is a rare single vineyard bottling of this up-and-coming variety in the state. It brings aromas of coffee, soil and vanilla that lead to tightly coiled purple-fruit flavors. It packs a mouthful of fruit, acid and tannins, bringing a whole lot of intrigue and appeal.
Three years aging have softened the tight acidity of this wine and given it a rounded and creamy character. It still has great freshness and a light touch of apple and crisp grapefruit. Drink this attractive wine now.
The chilly 2011 vintage was kind to this wine, giving it fine acidity yet still ripe fruit. It showcases Viognier's flamboyant, exotic flavors like tropical fruit, citrus, peach and honeysuckle, along with the buttered toast of new French oak. It's an elegant wine to drink now with rich foods.
Produced from 40-year-old vines with Merlot dominant in the blend, this is a dark wine showing tight black-currant fruits and crisp acidity. With its texture and dry tannins still prominent in its youth, the wine needs to age so drink from 2018.
It is curious how the Cabernet, presumably ripe, tastes austere. It is young, and the tannins will certainly soften, but this is a hard wine at the moment, all edges. Blueberries and cranberries are the dominant fruits, while the wood shows as toastiness.
This wine opens with aromas of vanilla and baking spices that are followed by broad, silky-feeling fruit and barrel flavors, finishing on a somewhat bitter note. The oak holds a prominent role but still plays its part well.

Swirls of char, smoke and vanilla envelop plush blackberry and plum notes on this perfumed blend of Pinot Noir, Dornfelder, Regent and Pinot Madelaine grapes. It's juicy and concentrated yet maintains a freshness of acidity and herbaceousness. Fine-grained, pert tannins lend a bit of edge to this approachable, enjoyable wine.
New to the American market, and worthy of a splashy debut. Plum fruit is deep and muscular on the nose, while the palate offers lifted berry flavors along with softer, more plush plums. Juicy and well structured, and probably not unlike your other favorite big South Australian Shirazes.
This wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Merlot, all from Burgess Vineyard. The aromas display each variety in turn, with notes of high-toned herbs followed by plum and dried cherries. Tart flavors show a focus on acid, and are far more elegant in style than most wines from this vintage.
This has a dense bouquet, with aromas of beet, clove, mint, tomato and berry fruit. The mouthfeel is rich and saturated, with a rawness that didn't exist in prior years. Flavors of mixed herb, earth and savory berry end with a long finish.
Here's a Gavi with a heady fragrance of wild flowers, apple and white cherry. The round palate delivers creamy, ripe pear, green apple and mineral with a hint of lemon and herbs. Pair it with pasta topped with sun-dried tomato pesto.
A fine bottle — full, fleshy, immediately throwing out dense aromatics with toast and roasted coffee and bitter chocolate components. A deep vein of black cherry and cassis keeps the core tight and focused, and a small splash of Syrah adds the scent of black pepper.
With a very mineral texture, this is a wine with as much tannin as fruit. It does have a bitter cherry character that gives some freshness, while the aftertaste combines both the dryness and the acidity.
Round and ripe, this is a wine with generous, opulent fruits and touches of spice from wood aging. Plenty of yellow fruit and sliced apple flavors mingle with the mineral texture and fragrant acidity. With its power and richness still to develop, it's a wine to age, needing at least until 2018.
An effusively flowery, honeyed wine, brimming with bright aromas of butterscotch and smoke, apricots, vanilla and cinnamon. It's exotically fruity and rich, with complex flavors ranging from apricot preserves to ginger. Tasty on its own.
Has a flinty, minerally edge to the aromas, which are otherwise classic Mosel: green apple with a lemon-lime chaser. It's light, lean, racy and sweet all at once, with a cool stone core and tremendous length and cut on the finish.
This tastes like young fruit, tart and simple, with strawberry and some high-toned aromas. There is new wood also, but since it's relatively young, the wine has retained at least a sense of fruit, and it's clean and fresh.
With more than 16% alcohol, this Zin has a hot mouthfeel, even for Dry Creek Zinfandel. Still, it's dry and smooth, with savory flavors of blackberry jam, chocolate, red and black currants, bacon and pepper. It's a good example of its type, and of Mazzocco's house style.
A blend of Petite Sirah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Zinfandel, Vezer's Jake's has a good, dark earthy personality, with a depth of spice around its big shoulders and dusty Petite Sirah finish.
There's a fresh, bright quality to this blend of Magliocco, Greco Nero and Malvasia grapes. It delivers aromas of crushed white pepper, prune and exotic spice.
Lovely scents of orchard fruit and apple blossom take center stage. The vibrant, savory palate offers crunchy rennet apple, tangerine and mineral while zesty acidity leads to the tangy finish.
Faint red currant and baked apple notes play about the nose. The dry palate reflects the same notions of fruit but makes them more lively with pink grapefruit freshness. The frothy mousse accentuates this aromatic fruit even more. The finish is dry and satisfying.
A delicious wine whose richness is matched by great texture and big, juicy fruits. It has plenty of tannins, but they meld easily into the rich ripe fruits, leaving a wine with a structure that offers considerable potential.
Opulent and creamy, this well-made and well-priced blend delivers distinctive notes of banana, vanilla and almond backed by stone fruit and mature melon. It's cool and crisp and offers lingering flavors of exotic fruit.
Light and fruity, with a touch of pepper and spice, this is a immediately attractive, red-fruited wine. It has enough crisp freshness as well as richness to go with food. The aftertaste emphasizes both spice and fruit.
With scents and flavors of chocolate-covered cherries, this pretty and accessible Pinot Noir promises a bit more than it delivers. The light cherry fruit turns a bit earthy and tannic as it winds into a quick finish.
Fans of big, blocky reds that offer punch, extract and tannins should jump on this now, and then watch it age nicely for the next four or five years. That's the type of meaty, tannic, fruit-infused Tempranillo this is. It's always going to be short and stocky, but still it will round into shape as it matures.
Here's a rich, bone-dry Chardonnay that shows long hangtime flavors of peaches, apricots, tangerines, Meyer lemons, honeysuckle, custard and tangy minerals. It's brightened with crisp acidity. Super-drinkable.
Good balance and vivid fruit flavors are the strong points of this well-put-together wine. Bright aromas like raspberries and red cherries are followed by rich but still attractively tangy flavors that ride on a very firm texture of fine tannins and appetizing acidity. This one will gain more complexity and interest with time, so it's best to drink after 2017.
Overtly sweet aromas and flavors dominate this upstate New York offering. Wiemer’s wines have impressed us before, but this comes off as heavy-handed, with a dense, perfumey quality. It possesses decent length and texture, but the weighty sweetness makes it a better candidate for mimosas or for entertaining those who shy away from dryness.
Here's a plump and chewy expression of Barbera with thick fruit notes followed by dense extraction and power. The wine is plush, ripe and velvety and there are soft flavors of fruit and spice on the long finish.
Vital and tannic after a number of years, a testament to this grape's aging ability. The bouquet deals strawberry, raspberry, mint and sage. In the mouth, hard tannins frame plum and cherry fruit, which is backed by a racy, no-holds-barred finish. Nothing out of place; well structured.
91-93 Barrel sample. A big and powerful wine, packed with ripe fruits, solid tannins. But those tannins are sweet, well integrated into the fruit. Fine, rich and juicily ripe.
A winning wine that displays a vibrantly fragrant tangerine, citrus and herb-butter bouquet. It opens to a full, dense tropical-fruit palate and shows an almost seamless texture. Tangy oak plays off the lingering fruit nuances on this bottling's lengthy, luxurious finish.
Aromas of ripe black fruit, coffee, oak, vanilla and a whiff of rubber take shape in the glass. The palate offers black raspberry, mocha and dark spice notes alongside polished tannins.
Ripe and solid, this is a thoroughly enjoyable California example of this Rhône varietal. The wine presents an enticing bouquet of tropical fruits, floral scents, vanilla, even a hint of banana. The palate is medium weight, with citrus and more vanilla flavors. Closes nicely with light spice and toasty accents.
Carneros is one of the best places to grow Pinot Grigio/Gris in California. The cool climate lends this unoaked wine vital acids and subtle citrus, peach, flower and mineral flavors. With a dry, spicy finish, it's a nice partner for roasted chicken.
Oaky, with blackberry, cherry and currant flavors compromised with mint and oregano, and with a sharp finish. Not going anywhere.
Clean and encouraging even if it lacks that true Prosecco nose of lime and slate. Here you get apple and vanilla aromas before fresh apple, pear and cinnamon flavors. Easygoing and perfectly good. Even a touch rich and creamy.
Nicely dry and acidic, giving a clean, scoury mouthfeel to this food-friendly wine. The flavors combine tart citrus fruits with vanilla, yeast, minerals and peppery spices. A crisp cocktail wine to start the meal.
Made in Zitsa, the only area within Epirus, Greece entitled to an appellation, this sparkler is made with a traditional white wine variety called Debina. True to the grape, the wine has a lively acidity, good minerality and an overall attractive quality. It's a touch clunky and hard to embrace for a sparkling wine, though—and needs to be paired with food.
Very pale in color, just beyond rose. Wonderfully fragrant aromas of black cherries, cola, Oriental spices, smoke and mushroomy earth. It packs a real punch in the mouth, too, with a great depth of rich, fruity, spicy flavor. Dry, with soft tannins but lively acidity.

Cusumano's Sàgana brings the focus to the quality of the fruit. The wine shows red berry, spice and a unique toasted note that resembles almond or pistachio.
An enormously rich Chard brimming with Mandarin orange, tangerine, pineapple, butterscotch and toasty oak flavors. Cool-climate acidity provides a brisk sense of balance to this charming, affordable wine.
A hint of peach on the still closed nose draws you in. The palate with its concentration of zesty citrus peel suggests that this might benefit from some bottle age, so that all that lovely peach and lemon can unfurl. This is sleek, concentrated and packs a punch. Drink 2017–2025 at least.
Crede is a top-notch Prosecco Brut (with 10% Pinot Bianco and 5% Verdiso added to the blend for extra structure and crispness respectively) that offers generous fresh fruit tones followed by almond blossom, macadamia nut and Golden Delicious apple. The mouthfeel is streamlined and crisp with a creamy, frothy finish.

The deep, dark red color and richly ripe fruit and berry aromas tell you just how fine the grapes got in this wonderful vintage. The essence of plums and blackberries jumps out of the glass. Full and rich; those who think Monterey can't ripen a Bordeaux varietal just might be surprised. Yes, it's a little soft, and don't look for rich, complex tannins like you find in the North Coast. But this is a deeply satisfying, serious red wine.

Made from grapes sourced from a single vineyard, this is an intensely minerally Champagne. It is dry and austere, with citrus fruits dominant. The wine needs to age to bring out all of the richness and toast flavor, but it will always be a structured Champagne. This is very much a food wine.
This structured Barbera offers aromas of ripe cherry, raspberry and plum with light toasted notes. The palate delivers a tight core of black cherry with black pepper and licorice, layered with a hint of espresso. This still needs a year or two to fully unwind, so it's best after 2015.
Blason's well-priced Sauvignon is streamlined and lean in the mouth but very pleasantly aromatic on the nose. You'll get shadings of stone fruit, kiwi and grapefruit and enough citrus zest on the close to cleanse the palate.
Highly perfumed, with delicate floral and peach notes leaping out of the glass. Melon and peach flavors combine on the palate. Lightweight and finishes short, but it's a solid apéritif. Best Buy.

It's a sweet, thick wine with great intensity and the potential to age many more years to come.
A structured wine, it has the weight and the firm tannins to give it aging potential. Black cherries, dark fruits and juicy acidity are paired with the drier tannic structure, amking for a smooth and rich wine. Drink from 2016.
Very round and candied, with a ton of vanilla on the nose. It's made in the supersweet style, as if it's supposed to go with wedding cake or caramel bon bons.

Certainly not to everyone's liking but not a poorly made wine by any means.
Strong raisin and prune flavors give this wine a late-harvest character, while fruit acidity and tannin makes the texture grippy.

A light, floating style from a master of Chardonnay in a top vintage. Flavors of grapefruit, red apples and a fine, dry, tight finish balance beautifully between richness and a taut, dry character.
Don't be confused by the name; this is a blend of fruit from three different sites, united by their “green” farming practices—hence the name and the green label, that sets it apart from the rest of the Panther Creek lineup. Earthy and infused with composted, organic flavors, this herbal, leafy Pinot Noir comes across as a little rough and tumble, but interesting.
Waxy and sweet on the nose, with aromas of corn and cotton candy. Flavors best described as apple and lemon are weak, and the finishing notes are sour.

This Merlot, Cab and Petite Sirah blend sneaked into a very upscale Napa Cabernet tasting, and it acquitted itself very well.

With black currant, plum, pepper and dark chocolate flavors, it's fine now and should hold and blossom for 6–8 years.
The blend of Chardonnay and Fernão Pires gives this wine an attractive, textured character. It is full of ripe and creamy yellow fruit and citrus, with a streak of crisp acidity. Drink now.
From 30-year-old vines, this is beautifully built and already showing the complexity that predicts a long life ahead.

Drink now with pleasure, or put a few bottles away to enjoy through 2027 or longer.
The intensity of the acidity, piercing through the sweetness, is what is astonishing about this wine. It gives the wine an ethereal quality, a lightness to go with the concentration of the dried fruits and orange zest flavors. The essence of TBA.

The first Merlot in the winery's 15-year history is restrained, aromatic and lightly leafy, showing hints of tobacco under the pretty, soft, plum and berry fruit.

Tight and lean, austere in character, the fruit showing definite green characters.

This wine is savory in style, with flavors of raspberries, orange peel and cola. Harsh in the mouth, with scoury acids and some abrupt tannins.
As always, a stylish and well-proportioned effort from winemaker Joy Anderson. Blackberry and smoke wrap into a mid-palate with good focus and grip. Despite its modest price, this wine can go one-on-one with a thick, juicy steak. Tannins are just rough enough to give it some welcome muscle.
There's a simple aromatic generosity to this wine that comes forth in pulses of red cherry, spice, vanilla and smoke. It feels ripe and chewy in the mouth with good power of persistency and a plush, velvety texture. Pair this Brunello with roasted duck or game hen.

Chocolate, sweet spice, tobacco, leather and dark berry fruit give this Brunello a bold and impactful first impression. When it comes to the mouthfeel, the wine plays a more subtle game with polished tannins, mild cherry fruit and a bright point of fresh acidity.
Made in a more popular style than Calera's Mt. Harlan bottling, this Chard features lush flavors of pineapple and orange jam, honey and vanilla. The acidity is bright and mouthwatering.

Not many varietal Marsannes are made in California, and this one is impressive. Savory, earthy nuances—rather than fruity ones—dominate, giving it a distinctive flavor profile. It starts with dried herb and mineral aromas, brings in fennel bulb and white pepper flavors and wraps it all with a luscious texture that powers a long, lingering finish.
Very sweet and chocolaty, with plenty of smoky oak. Cherries, blackberries and spicy plum pudding in a rustic package. Syrah and Zinfandel.

Dusty, lightly oaked berry aromas are entirely regular, while the berry driven palate is dry, drawing and oaky, with pretty good body but stand-out acidity as well. Tastes a bit woody and peppery late. A highly generic wine that makes you wonder why it costs $30.
Fresh pear, white peach and fig aromas, a rich texture, and generous vanilla and layered almond flavors describe this tasty wine that stays fresh and fruity through the finish. It offers a medium body and nice balance.

This is a satin-smooth Merlot, nicely blended with 11% Syrah and a splash of Cabernet Sauvignon. Forward flavors, seamless, supple and flat out tasty, it weaves in threads of vanilla, cola and licorice around taut red fruits.
All of Le Cadeau's wines are made by different winemakers; here it is Chehalem's Harry Peterson-Nedry at the winemaking helm. He puts more emphasis on the herbal, leafy, somewhat resinous aspect of the grape, making a more Oregonian, less Burgundian style. Good intensity and focus carry it through an extended finish.
Another fine wine from this unheralded producer. Malbec, Cabernet and Merlot weave a nice picture based on sweet raisin, coconut and chocolate aromas. The palate is tannic but generous, with flavors of prune, blackberry, chocolate and tobacco. Chubby, rich and ripe, with intensity and darkness throughout.
A Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon blend made in the white Bordeaux style, with lots of oak. Too much oak, in fact. The wine is dominated by smoky char and caramel, and tastes sweet in butterscotch.
A clean aroma of apple that's detailed with light notes of fresh herb and barrel toast introduce this well-structured Chardonnay. It's a solid effort, buoyed by good natural acidity.
This Chardonnay, a blend of various coastal vineyards, is marked by high acidity and great dryness. It is emphatically not a soft, honeyed fruit gusher. The sleek minerality and elusive citrus fruit flavors have just the right touch of buttery, toasted oak. Drink now.
Ripe raspberries, plump alpine strawberries and cranberry-cola notes meet with shaved cinnamon, pencil lead and dried sage on the nose of this single vineyard expression. The flavors are focused on woody red fruits, with chaparral scrub highlights as well as bay leaf and juniper. It's relatively light but well layered.
Subdued aromas include white spring flowers, pear and apple. The palate delivers green apple along with a hint of lemon peel and almond. You'll notice the warmth of alcohol on the close.
This bottling from young winemaker Michael Miroballi shows lime blossom, chalk, fresh rain on concrete and nectarine flesh on the nose. The palate is exuberant with flavors but they're not ripe, instead showing lime peels and juice, a cement-like grip and a buzzing sensation that overtakes the mouth like a Sichuan peppercorn.
Cabernet specialist von Strasser turns to the only Zinfandel vineyard on this mountain to produce this dense, layered young wine. Well-oaked, it shows smoky flavors of blackberry marmalade, red and black currants and peppery spices, and has the texture of a fine Cabernet. Drink now through 2013.
This red-tinged rosado hits the nose with sharp and herbaceous scents. A drawing palate with sour citrus flaand pyrazines ends equally raw, tart and green.
An equal blend of wine fermented in stainless steel and fermented in wood (hence Consensus), this is finely balanced. Its apple and apricot fruits have great acidity, while also rich, fruity and structured. The finish is lingering, fresh.
I like this wine for its pretty color and pleasant flavors of raspberries and cherries, and the acidity works. But it's definitely a sweetie, which detracts. Take away the sweetness and you have a world class rose.
This is a landmark Amarone that has often acted as the category's biggest ambassador abroad. It bursts open with aromas of dark berry, spice, leather and tobacco, and it is both generous and long-lasting on the palate.
Coming from Summit View Vineyard, this 100% varietal wine has aromas of espresso, toast and exotic spices, with the barrel notes primary. The palate has medium-weight dark fruit flavors, lightening in the midpalate, along with abundant coffee accents. Although the barrel influence is somewhat overt for the fruit that's in the glass, it still brings lots of enjoyment.
Given that the number of good Argentine PGs can be counted on one hand, this one distinguishes itself. The nose is a touch sweaty and prickly, but the fresh palate, sporty acidity and solid flavors of lime, tangerine and nectarine are nice. Drink now.
A blend of 55% Chenin Blanc and 45% Viognier, with the Chenin strongly represented. This wine unveils caramel popcorn and oak-influenced pear-vanilla, its layers of texture workable with a wide range of food.
In a style that nods more to Bordeaux than the New World, the cassis, tobacco and herb bouquet shows class and style. Displays fine balance and good acidity, which supports the ripe black-currant fruit, cedar and peppery notes. It's structured rather than plush, and finishes long, dry and toasty. Drinkable now, it should improve further with a few years' aging.
An interesting blend of 37% Carignan, 26% Shiraz, 20% Petit Verdot, 15% Petite Sirah and 2% Viognier, this is a delightful red that offers tons of complexity and character. Black plum, cherry and currant fruit flavors are integrated with herbal notes of sandalwood, cigar spice and licorice root. Round and full but structured with gripping tannins and balanced acidity, and everything carrying through the long finish. Drink now through 2014.
Just delicious, a really fine Syrah notable for its balance and complexity. Dry and smoky, it has plum, blackberry and coffee flavors, with a streak of sweet anise and leather. Doesn't say so on the label, but the grapes came from the Unti Vineyard. The tannins are rich and thick, but this wine is best in its flashy youth.
This is 100% Cabernet, hence the name. It's direct in its appeal, with cassis and new oak flavors that are wrapped into significant tannins. It's a nice, rich wine, but not a great one. Despite every effort, the heat has taken its toll, making it overly soft and a little cooked. Drink now.
This longtime winemaking family uses an old-style label on this bottling of the classic Italian grape, which spent 24 months on American oak. Rusty bloody aromas of cranberry, peppercorn and carnation lead into a palate framed by stiff tannins and strong acidity. Red-fruit flavors mix with woody spice, and the finish is sticky, showing that this wine is still very young.
A good, polished Pinot for drinking now. It's brisk in acidity and has a hint of green mint, but the raspberry, cherry and cedar flavors are delicious.
Even at the age of nearly five years, this Bordeaux blend remains astringently tough in tannins and dry, with a rasping finish. Doesn't seem likely to improve.
Made with 95% Malvasia and 5% Sangiovese, this opens with aromas of resin, dried fruit and flaky pastry. On the sweet but rather fresh palate, clover honey and pine nut accent a core of mature apricot.
Plump and rounded rather than racy. Some slightly dieselly aromas bring complexity to the mix of melon, spice and slate, while the mineral-laden finish lingers.
A medium-bodied, off-dry style, with scents of baked apples and vegetable oil followed by flavors of apple and peach accented by peppery cinnamon-tinged spice. It's slightly creamy in texture, with a long, mouthcoating finish. Drink now.
A sophisticated and seductive expression of the Primitivo grape, this Antinori-made Puglian wine boasts thick concentration, fruity extracts, ripe cherry flavors, strawberry and a thick inky appearance. The tannins are rock solid suggesting a pairing with roasted meats, steak or aged cheeses.
Unripe, with wintergreen and pepper aromas and flavors, and sharp acidity. Turns a little more generous with airing, but it's overpriced for what you get.
A firm, structured wine, big and bold, bursting with black cherry fruits, plums, figs and a dry core of dark tannins. It has all the bravura of the appellation.
This blend of 80% Syrah and 20% Grenache offers heady and thick violet and plum extract aromas, and smells heavier in alcohol than it is. The palate shows ripe black cherry, but it's eye-wateringly tannic, and needs quite a bit of time in the cellar to evolve.
Somms will have fun pairing this wine with just the right foods. It's very complex, with the blackberry, currant and cocoa fruit balanced by earthy, meaty notes. The tannins are rich and fine, hinting at future development. This is Larner's inaugural release, making it a winery to watch. Drink now–2015.
Steely and mineral in character, this is a taut, nervy wine. It has great acidity and balance, with green fruit and sliced apple flavors. Keep for 3–4 years. Screwcap.
A pure expression of Primitivo, this shows slightly muddled aromas at first that slowly open to show clear portraits of Indian spice, cherry, ripe blackberry, prune and candied fruit. The finish is round, soft and chewy.
From Cabernet maestro Nick Goldschmidt, this Merlot-Cabernet Franc blend is eminently drinkable now. It's soft and dry, with gentle tannins framing jammy raspberry and cherry flavors.

Notes of milk chocolate accompany black currant, green olive and toasty oak flavors in this dry, creamy 100% Cabernet. It's not an ager, but will be fine through 2017.
The aromas of this robust rosé scream “Pinot Noir,” with their earthy, leathery, cherry and barnyard elements. It tastes like a good Pinot that’s been livened up with bubbles; even the texture has some of that velvet that you find in Burgundies.
This is a smooth, rich wine. It has just the right amount of tannin to give structure and add to the ripe black fruits. A blend of classic Douro grapes gives a wine that is dense, firm and also generously ripe. Drink this fine wine now.
Blackberry, blueberry and creamy vanilla aromas comprise a sweet, chunky, very ripe bouquet. The mouthfeel is full, succulent and bouncy, while flavors of creamy oak, baking spices and black fruits finish with juicy acidity and plenty of wood, chocolate and licorice notes. 150 cases made; drink through 2018.
Just off dry, this is a smooth, attractively fruity wine that has a light touch of perfume. The acidity keeps the freshness level up, producing a wine that's easy to drink now. Screwcap.
Dark strawberry and red-cherry fruit shows on the nose of this bottling by the regional pioneer, leveled by scents of violets, rose petals and pencil lead. Graphite and beet juice start the sip, which evolves into black olive, dried basil and bay leaf sprinkled atop cranberry and elderberry juice.
Given that this is where Santa Barbara County's first Syrah was planted, it's no wonder that Zaca Mesa makes well-balanced expressions of the grape with stunning consistency. This bottling shows blackberry, black pepper, cola and purple flowers on the nose, leading into a tightly structured palate packed with tart black-plum skins, beef char and more black-pepper dust.
Consistent year after year, this frizzante style Muscat is off dry, fresh and aromatic, with Muscat's sweet orange flavor up front. Serve it chilled or try it as a mixer in place of Prosecco.
While this gorgeous Cab shows a ripe approachability that makes it instantly drinkable, it also has a tannicly closed element that suggests aging. A fine steak will pair beautifully with the wine's tannins, acids and blackberry fruit, and you don't want to hang onto it too long. But in the next six years this wine will change in interesting ways.
Charred, earthy black-fruit aromas are smoky and power-packed. This feels full yet balanced, with freshness and strong tannins. Ripe berry, prune and oak-spice flavors finish with a note of vanilla and length. For a Crianza from a tough vintage, this is commendable.
This is an aromatic, sweet smelling Riesling with notes of ripe peach and honeysuckle. Though labeled as dry, at 1.86% residual sugar it drinks almost medium-sweet. Misdirection aside, it provides good value.
The 2006 Jimmy Section is made in a rich, syrupy style, but does it have enough structure to improve with age? The dense blackberry and blueberry fruit carries its 15.5% alcohol well—at least for the moment—and there are some attractive peppery, herbal complexities that make for intersting drinking right now, so why wait?
Off the bat this smells weedy, with a hint of generic red-berry fruit to help things along. A green-tasting wiry palate finishes with burnt underripe berry notes.
Already showing some signs of oxidation, which has softened but not integrated the flavors. This is a disjointed wine, tannic, spicy, with a sweet cracker flavor that falls off into an empty mid-palate before heading into very dry, very chalky tannins at the finish.
Opens with a blast of well-toasted oak, vanilla, caramel and char, and oak dominates the palate through the finish. Underneath is some ripe peach and pear fruit. The texture is soft and creamy.
Red berry, citrus, hazelnut and a hint of Alpine herb lead the nose on this vibrant sparkler. A blend of 75% Pinot Noir and 25% Chardonnay, the racy palate doles out strawberry, cherry, nectarine zest and a hint of crystallized ginger alongside a vibrant persistent perlage.
Crisp and brightfresh acidity and ethereal aromas of rosemary and dried basil. The nose is pungent.
An intensely ripe Syrah with the pure essence of cassis, kirsch and fudge. Has soft and melted tannins, and so the inclusion of 5% Viognier brings a welcome kick of citrus and acidity. Very delicious now.
Hints of graphite mark the nose, but this wine is tight and restrained aromatically. Green apple and citrus flavors are crisply defined and tightly focused, ending long, with mouth-tingling acids. Give it another couple of years to develop in the bottle.
This informal red offers aromas of ripe blackberry and Mediterranean herb. The round, simple palate shows black cherry, ripe blackberry and ground cooking spice alongside soft, fleeting tannins. Drink now.

This medium-bodied, slightly creamy-textured Sauvignon Blanc showcases gooseberry and pink grapefruit flavors, with an appealing herbal note on the finish.
Generous and rounded, this wine combines the opulence of Volnay with a strongly tannic character coming from the old vines. Together, it's a rich, fruit-filled wine that is backed by a dry core and fragrant red berry acidity. Drink from 2018.
Dry and common, with thinned-down cherry and cola flavors, wrapped into a silky texture. Acidity is high, and the wine tastes a little sour.
Fruity, crisp and slightly sweet, with pear, citrus, fig and spearmint flavors, this easy sipper will go well with a variety of foods.
A ripe wine, very Bordeaux in its dominant tannins and dry fruit skin character. It does show richness with an attractive smoky character to go with the firm structure. Drink now, but it could age 2–3 years.
It opens with a delicate floral fragrance of white spring flowers accented by a whiff of apple and Alpine herbs. The steely, linear palate delivers juicy yellow apples together with a mineral note and lively acidity.
Raspberry Pinot Noir fruit is on fresh display. The wine is light, with the tight acidity of the vintage, but the varietal purity sings out.
Basic citrus and green-leaning aromas introduce a mild palate with flavors of lime, celery and green herbs. A light, easy finish is on the watery and hollow side.
90-92 Barrel sample. This has all the flavors of an Asian kitchen, spices dominant and, underneath, some attractive lemon and honey botrytis. This should be a great aperitif style of wine.
A spicy, earthy wine that serves up ripe currant, plum and blackberry flavors. Layers of licorice, mineral and herbs are also in evidence. The finish is tangy, with firm, supple tannins.
In only its second vintage in the U.S., this nutty, mineral-rich, immensely fruity wine from Antinori's coastal estate is a great example of the heights that Vermentino can achieve. This version is full of lime, stone, citrus and marzipan, and is focused from beginning to end
This is a well crafted, aromatic reserve, crafted in a pretty style that brings scents and flavors of fresh raspberries and candied cherries to the fore. Streaks of cola and clean earth add some depth to the finish.
Shows aromas of fresh-cut grass and white peach. Peach resurfaces on the palate, where it's joined by some green apple flavors. Straightforward and easy, but tasty enough.
High acidity combines with ripe fruit to produce a tense, full-bodied wine. At this stage, the fruit has not yet integrated with the tannins.
Although the oak levels in some T-L cuvées have moderated, the nose of this wine remains distinctive for its lavish vanilla and cedar scents. That sexy oak is backed by black cherry and plum fruit and a full-bodied, creamy texture that turns just a bit astringent on the finish. Drink now–2020.
On the nose, aromas of wax, white orchard fruit and lemon are offset by a note of wet stone. This is a medium-bodied wine that has an open-feeling, pliant midpalate. The finish bears zesty acidity, and it comes with a sweet-tasting flavor of lemon Italian ice.
Light, fresh, perfumed with acacia blossom, this is a great warm weather aperitif wine, as well as one that goes well with any fish. Its crisp grapefruit and citrus flavors sit easily with the light texture of spice. Screwcap.
The nose offers earthy, medicinal notes on the light black-cherry fruit. Thin on the palate, it has a cough syrup-like taste. The tannins are soft, the acids low. Finishes short.
There seems to be a great deal of new oak here, to judge by the fresh, strong aromas of vanilla, cedar and smoky char, but those scents mesh well with the cassis, mocha, peat and anise that come from fruit. There's also a leathery thing going on, a little sweaty, but it adds a spicy complexity.
Intriguing Asian spice, peanut brittle, pineapple and butter cream aromas comprise the bouquet of this round, well-integrated wine from Sonoma County's tiny Green Valley appellation. Everything flows smoothly into the lingering pineapple, butterscotch, pear and apple flavors in the finish. Top Value.

Bona fide Best Buys aren't as ubiquitous as they once were, so take note of this affordable Garnacha from northeast Spain. The wine features clean aromas of dried fruits, spice and licorice. The palate is just as proper, with sweet plum and berry flavors. It may be a tiny bit screechy and gritty, but we're talking $9 here, so get on board.
Intense sensations of blue flower, juicy marasca cherry, blackberry and blueberry form the focus of this luminous blend of 85% Sangiovese, 10% Ciliegiolo and 5% Alicante. White pepper and cinnamon spice give the juicy, delicious palate depth while supple tannins and freshness make it extremely accessible. It's at its peace so enjoy soon. Vos Selections, Tosco Wine,
This wine comes from a small Chardonnay enclave in the predominantly red premier cru of Beaune Grèves. With its intense exotic fruit and apricot flavors, it's both ripe and crisp with acidity. That makes for a delicious reflection of the vintage, needing time to mature. Drink from 2020.
A touch overripe, showing some bitter, dried raisinskin notes. If you can get past that, you'll find plenty of rich blackberry, dark chocolate, plum, beef jerky and black pepper flavors.
A 100% Chardonnay that is rich, with a creamy feel and flavors of tropical fruits. It is full and food-friendly with a dry aftertaste, and a touch of almonds. Imported by Kobrand.
Perhaps it's a trick of this wine's slightly coppery hue, but it seems to have some peach and strawberry scents along with intense pink grapefruit flavors. Its medium weight gives the impression of ripe fruit balanced by racy acids, finishing clean and crisp.
Planted on its original rootstock, these Carignano vines produce a broad and wide-reaching wine with good intensity and endurance in the mouth. The aromas, on the other hand, are delicate and precise and focus on small berries and spice.
It's too bad California can't produce more Grenache Blanc, especially along these lines. This is a crisp, dry, layered white complex in almond, honey, green apple and dried apricot tones and tartness. Very dark in color, like an apricot liqueur, but the flavors are fresh and refreshing.
Disagreeable for its harsh acidity and vegetal streak that mars the cherries and suggests a bitter green herb. Disappointing.
This heavily wood-dominated wine features a dry and tannic texture. It seems lean for the vintage, giving the impression of severity. The fruit shows only in the acidity at the end.
With eight years of age on it, this wine is at a beautiful point in its evolution with delicate elegance, refined perfumes and special accents on cinnamon, mineral tones and bright fruit. It's sophisticated and persistent, with silky tannins and sweet spice on the close.
Odd aromas of pomegranate and grapefruit are off the grid. This is citric and austere in feel, with sour, herbal flavors mixed with oak. A minty, herbal, green finish raises questions.
A majestic wine, grand in every sense. It has weight, the firmest of tannins and an immense sense of structure. This neighbor of Château Pétrus is firmly dense, showing both the fruits and the tannins in balance. Give this wine at least 10 years in the cellar.
Woody, herbal and resplendent in forest-floor pine and sandalwood, this is a complex, earthy and medium-bodied wine. It's low in oak, and revelatory in cool-climate seductions of pomegranate, cranberry and rhubarb compote. The finish is all black tea, with still-developing tannin structure and power.
Grippy blackberry and licorice wrap around an intriguing bouquet of Italian deli meats and spices, with sinewy tannins and unobtrusive oak. Given over a year in 40% new French oak, it proffers a subtle hit of pepper on the finish.
Whiffs of vanilla, saffron, peach and yellow cherry lend exotic flair to this unctuous yet delicate dessert wine. A blend of Riesling, Scheurebe and Huxelrebe grapes, its unique composition lends plumpness of fruit balanced by zesty acidity and a lingering waxy sheen. It's sure to be a dramatic finish to an elegant dinner event, yet surprisingly affordable.
Alleanza represents a successful collaboration between winemakers in Italy and California. The 70-30 blend consists of Merlot and Sangiovese and the wine is seductively redolent of wild berries, exotic spice, soft chocolate and mild tobacco. The plush mouthfeel wins points thanks to the smooth and silky nature of the finish.
This is definitely high in alcohol, with a notable chili pepper burn, but that's the winery's style. Without that ripeness, you wouldn't have these intense, briary blackberry and mulberry flavors. Notes of chocolate, raisin, anise liqueur and exotic spice provide additional complexity. This is a Zin that needs rich, oily meats and cheeses to balance it out.
This rosé has aromas of toast and walnut. It's bitter and dry, and lacks the fruit richness to balance its lean and astringent sensations.
With an over-oaked taste and sugary flavors of peach, pineapple and apricot jam, this Chard is more like a dessert wine.
This is a ruby reserve, bright red/black in color, with youthful fruity freshness. There are black fruits, with an edge of stalkiness, but ripely sweet at the same time. The aftertaste reveals good balancing acidity.
A wine that is so soft, its texture only just brushes the palate. White fruits and lemon juice give a gentle, balanced character that is light and quite ready to drink.
Lots of inviting smoke, roasted pork, bacon fat, oak, blackberry and leather show on the nose of this blend of 54% Zinfandel, 31% Petite Sirah and 15% Syrah. Flavors are well integrated on the palate, almost too mellowly done, with tangy black-plum skins and pencil lead framed by a solid tannic structure.
This wine is soft and ripe with a generous palate of wild-strawberry flavor, but a balancing act of acidity lends elegance. It's fruity but finishes crisp and dry.
A sweet, medium-bodied style of Pinot Gris, with honeyed flavors of apple, pear and pineapple. Despite the sweetness, the finish is nicely balanced, with a lush texture. Even prettier is the wine's pale copper hue.
With its pear and apricot fruits, this has a delicious full-bodied character, and the the grapefruit acidity keeps it fresh. Screwcap.
Feudo Montoni's “N” is a lactic young wine with aromas of almond milk, chopped herbs, exotic spice, cola and root beer. That makes for an awkward combination and the deeply purple-colored wine ends with freshly milled spice and peppercorn.
Aromas of bluish-black fruit, blue iris, menthol and aromatic herbs lead the nose of this 65% Sangiovese and 35% Cabernet Sauvignon blend. The palate offers dried black cherries, blackberries, coffee, tobacco and sage alongside firm, polished tannins. A note of ground aniseed closes the finish.
Made in the full-blown, barrel-fermented and -aged style, this wine shows off the cooper's art in its bold toasty-caramelly-vanilla aromas and flavors. Some peach fruit manages to sneak through the wooden stockade, providing a hint of balance.

Freshly squeezed lemons, lime and pretty white florals perfume this dry, medium-bodied Pinot Grigio. The palate is clean with juicy white grapefruit flavors and some interesting minerality, but it's a bit lacking in concentration.
Curiously dusty wine, tasting of under-ripe cranberry with a coating of sweetness. While it is identifiably Sauvignon Blanc, it does seem to have missed out on the region's signature minerality. Screwcap.
Fresh toast, wooded spice  on the nose is friendly and appealing. On the palate, it works too, with its playful balance of layered spice oak and fresh acidity. The wine will appeal to fans of both oaked and unoaked Chardonnay, and will make a nice addition to the table.
Modest cherry and plum aromas are weighty. This is holding onto its freshness, with flavors of citrus pulp and peel. Drink up now.
A straightforward, superb value wine perfect for a roast or rack of whatever dinner with friends. Lively and balanced with beautiful red fruit flavors accented by notes of olive and licorice on the finish. With 900 cases produced, grab what you can but enjoy it soon.
Aged for four months in oak, this wine brings an explosion of complex aromas of tangerine, dried apricot, honey and a speckling of smoky oak spices. The palate is full, rich and luscious, with concentrated stone fruit flavors that linger long after the last sip.
Full-bodied, rounded and soft wine. It has plenty of ripe plum and spice flavors along with an edge of toast. Attractive, juicy wine for drinking now.
To me, this luxury cuvée loses a bit of its identity to oak and ripeness while remaining an excellent red wine. Delicious? You bet. It's dark and intense, marked by the vanilla and cedar notes that overlay cherry and cracked pepper. The tannins are supple to the point of creaminess, creating a lush, soft mouthfeel.
A creamy, wood-aged white that simultaneously emphasizes crisp Sauvignon Blanc fruit and minerality. Hints of pineapple and lemon go with a tight texture. A rich yet fresh wine that could age for a few years but can also be enjoyed now.
The complex blend of Bordeaux grapes does not quite jell into a wine with specific focus. It's dark and tastes of black cherry, with grainy tannins and a chalky finish. The acids are not well integrated and the wine seems disjointed in the finish.
This Hungarian rosé is a blend of 33% Kékfrankos, 22% Cabernet Franc, 21% Cabernet Sauvignon, 16% Merlot, 5% Pinot Noir and 3% Syrah. It has aromas of strawberries, freshly sliced apple and fresh cherry juice. It flavors are those of bright cherry and red raspberry with a pleasant tartness on the finish.

Composed of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, with other Bordeaux varieties in the mix, this spent 30 months in barrel and 18 months in bottle prior to release. The dense, tannic Red Mountain fruit remains firm and compact, creating a wine that needs to be decanted. The layers of berry, cassis, leaf, bark, earth and spice are balanced and tight.
Partly barrel-fermented, this impressively ripe wine has structure and tannins, as well as attractive, perfumed fruits. The tannins add spice as well as a touch of pepper while integrating well with the lively, fresh fruits at the end. Drink from 2018.
Floral and honeyed smelling, then lighter as it airs out. Feels smooth but also tight and bright, with forward flavors of spiced apple, green herbs and melon. Round on the finish, with lasting character and body. Good for Chilean Viognier.
From the Weinbau vineyard, a hot site on the Wahluke Slope, this ripe, chewy Cabernet Franc beautifully expresses a Washington take on the grape. The tannins are there in force, but all the rough edges are polished, and they are ripe with black olive and black tea flavors. Right behind is a solid core of cassis and blueberry fruit, streaked with iron and smoke. A very fine effort from an exciting new winery.
Cola, leather and cherry aromas and flavors, in that order. There are tough tannins in this dry wine.
Fermented in stainless steel and concrete, this Sauvignon Blanc packs some pungency on the nose, with aromas of green coffee bean, drying grass, peach yogurt and ripe apricot. Medium to full in body, the acids are dynamic enough to charge the flower and mineral flavors. Pair this with pan-seared sea scallops served in a tarragon beurre blanc.
Solid, wood-flavored tannins give this wine a good, smooth texture. Flavors of red cherries dominate what is an attractively fruity wine.
Both wines from this new producer show significant bottle variation. This Cabernet remains stubbornly stiff and compact, despite hours of breathing time. Some tightly wound berry and pomegranate flavors poke through, with notes of thistle and herb.
Savory aromas of black pepper, leather and sandalwood provide depth to the core mulberry fruit on this clonal selection. Rounded flavors of black plums and dark berries are lifted by sagebrush, dried ginger and Christmas spice on the palate that offers layers and layers of depth.
Crushed stone and fresh lemon persist from nose to finish on this revitalizing off-dry Riesling. It's brisk and thirst quenching, offering loads of crisp-tart peach and tangerine flavors. The finish is long and refreshingly citrusy.
This is likeable for its dryness and the burst of lemony acidity that makes it so invitingly crisp. The flavors are subtle and rich, suggesting Meyer lemon, white peach and a lick of vanilla bean.
Upfront aromas of savory herbs and pressed apple lend an earthy feel to this medium-sweet wine. It opens gradually to reveal a pretty perfume of jasmine and lavender that penetrates long on the palate. It's juicy with sweet white-grapefruit flavor, and finishes tight with zesty lime and lemon astringency.
The nose is packed with dark notes of desiccated strawberry, red currant and caramel lozenge, plus dried herb and maduro subtleties. Astringent, lip-grabbing tannins bolster the fleshy, medium- to full-bodied palate. A few more years of bottle aging should help mitigate some of the tannic blow, but enjoy it now with a brief decanting and a slab of grilled meat.
Fresh and light in aroma, crisp and delicate in flavor, this wine is light-bodied, well-balanced and attractively restrained in character. Because of all that it will be extremely versatile with food—everything from shucked oysters to Thai food to smoked salmon.
One of Chile's more personality-driven Syrahs is Maycas, from Limarí. It's a condensed, meaty and structured wine with mineral, toast and ribald blackberry aromas. The palate is rich but well built, with plum, berry, herb and chocolate flavors. Warm and long on the finish, and layered. Sophisticated enough to give the world's better-made Syrahs a run for their money.
This is a really good Zinfandel for this price. It's dry and spicy, with tons of wild black, red and blue berries and an edge of rich, unsweetened dark chocolate. Versatile and classy. Drink now.

Barrantes is always a full-bodied Albariño from one of Rias Baixas's warmest subzones. The nose on the '07 is of doughnuts and pastry, with sweet pear kicking in. The flavors are peach, apricot and ripe citrus fruits, and the finish is pithy and wide. Plods along a bit; could stand to be lighter and smoother in scope.
This pure expression of the native Corvina grape opens with a thin ruby appearance and spicy aromas of wild berry and crushed black pepper. The wine is packaged with a glass cork that underscores its identity as an informal, food-friendly Italian red.
There's a unique quality to Bressan whites that almost always gives them away. You could describe it as sappy pine nut or chestnut honey and this Verduzzo is a prime example of what I mean. Make no mistake, this is a sophisticated and evolved wine with excellent length and deep golden saturation. But it's also an acquired taste.
While this wine is certainly tannic, the structure is beautifully cushioned by velvety, ripe black fruit. This has produced a rich, soft, dense wine that can certainly age for 2–3 years, yet is also ready to drink now.
Cherry soda, mint and crushed almond characterize the nose of this luminous rosé made with the hearty Aglianico grape. The wine is creamy and smooth with fresh berry acidity on the close. A Marc de Grazia selection, various American importers.
Earthy spice and red berry aromas lead this sturdy pour from Drama. On the palate, full-bodied flavors are balanced by a mineral edge. A good every day rosé that will match lamb and beef dishes well.
This wine is structured, dark and dense, with great swathes of smoky tannins plus plenty of red-fruit flavors. With its concentration, structure and richness, the wine will develop well and powerfully. Drink from 2021.
A restrained mix of peach, passion fruit and lemon plays on the nose. These notions are intensified on a sprightly, light body that shows purity of expression. Fine spritz intensifies the fruit notes, framing them in friendly, ripe lemon. Despite its lightness, this has body and balance. It's an elegant, restrained but invigorating wine with an aromatic finish.
Sweet and spicy, this easygoing, tasting room wine has plenty of sugar, but keeps its varietal character with Gewürzy notes of spice and flower. It leans to the soft side, but it's clean and persistent, and would be a good choice with very spicy Asian fusion dishes.
Dry spice and minty aromas cover up mild berry fruit scents. This is clunky and jammy in feel, with stewed berry and saucy flavors. The finish is herbal in general, with a chunky weight to it.
Aromas of ripe berry, brown cooking spice and a whiff of espresso lead the nose on this full-bodied red. The firmly structured palate offers juicy raspberry, black cherry and licorice alongside a backbone of assertive but noble tannins. Drink 2020–2032.
Cola and minty, herbal aromas come with raw oak and gritty, baked berry scents. This is rugged, tannic and grabby on the palate, with heavy wood resin flavors heaped atop blackberry and plum. Woodspice and heat drive the finish.
This one has extreme funky, deep aromas of tree bark and barnyard. But those smells yield to friendly layers of black cherry, plum, coffee and kirsch. We don't think this wine is for everyone (one of our panelists flat out did not care for it), but the depth and chewiness on the palate cannot be short-changed.
Thick, savory and darkly concentrated, this inky Sagrantino opens with aromas of ripe blackberry, prune, plum, cured meat and exotic spice. It shows firm, unyielding tannins on the finish.

Notes of nettle tea and crushed nettle partner with tart conference pear on an ultralight but beautifully textured body. A super-clean finish offers lemon tartness that lingers refreshingly. This is made for light fish cuisine, such as steamed white fish with fresh lemon and parsley.
Just three barrels were made of this rather unusual wine. It's a seemingly disparate mix of raspberries, gun metal, dried seaweed and carpaccio, yet somehow it all comes together. The length is impressive. This is one of those wines that will thrill some tasters and puzzle others.
A soft, easy-to-drink Pinot Noir—even for Marlborough. Tannins are developed and supple, while the flavors lean toward caramel, cherry and sandalwood. Drink now.
With its sandstone soil, the Abbaye de Morgeot vineyard is equally suited to Pinot Noir as to Chardonnay. But it is able to produce fresh, fruity wines, like this one. A spice and citric blend dances on the palate.
A nice Pinot Noir, with ripe, flashy red berry, cola and spice flavors. It's a bit rustic around the edges, but it does show a certain amount of elegance.
Textbook Jamet, with flamboyant swirls of cracked pepper, grilled meat, plum, berry, black olive and espresso finishing long and silky. It's not the biggest or baddest Côte Rôtie, but it remains a benchmark for elegance and balance. Drink now–2027.
Peach, melon and apple carry the clean but ordinary bouquet, and behind that comes a round palate full of ripe banana, pear, caramel and vanilla. Fully oaked but not overdone, with toast on the finish. Good Argentine Chardonnay. Imported by Billington Imports.
Having spent no time in oak, this crisp, clean white is resplendent in lemon curd and vanilla, joined midway by additional layers of just-picked peach. Medium bodied, with the right texture to hold up to a range of spicy foods, it offers a vibrantly lively finish.
Scents of chamomile tea with generous honey and lemon get down with white flowers and baking pie crust on this offering from Pierre Lafond, who's been making wine since the 1960s. The wine dances across the tongue, with bright papaya, pear and a dill-powered, nearly bitter finish. It's showing almost no age, so it will hold well, but it's also brilliant right now.
Stony and mineral on the nose, this brut-style sparkling Riesling revitalizes the palate with a fine persistent perlage. Flavors of tart green apple, lemon and pear are zesty and spry. It's a straightforward but four-square sparkler at a value price.
Two-thirds Chardonnay with Verdelho making up the balance, this is a pretty unique white. Has grassy notes on the nose, which join with pretty pungent notes of tangerine and peach on the palate. Soft and round in the mouth, it finishes with an orange-y note. Imported by Canandaigua Wine Co.
A severe sense of funk and sweat is the aromatic greeting on this Sauvignon Blanc-Semillón blend. A crisp, citric palate tastes green, like lime and tarragon. On the finish, this is tight and stony, with overt citric acidity.
Here's a fruity, cheerful wine that boasts a luminous golden color and enticing notes of honey-coated almonds, crusty crème brûlée, almond amaretto and a twist of orange zest. It's lighter and more approachable than your typical vin santo. If you plan to visit Tuscany, this estate's vin santo barrel room will be a highlight of your trip.
Still very young, this is a crisply fresh wine, all lemon zest and apple skin flavors. There is a young, green element here that needs to soften over the next few months. Screwcap.
Intensely aromatic, this is a spicy, sublime and soft wine, elegant and unexpected, bright and alive and fresh instead of overbearing. Its rustic roots endear rather than distract, with an exuberance of blueberry at its core.
A blend of 57% Cabernet Sauvignon, 14% Merlot, 13% Malbec, 11% Cabernet Franc and 5% Petit Verdot, this stunning, well-balanced wine will reward patience. Dark and dense, it's a powerful selection that boasts serious fruit concentration and a full, firm structure, with mouthcoating tannins. The black-fruit core is accented by notes of leather, fresh mint, pepper, char and bittersweet cocoa. Additional nuance and layers of complexity will develop with time; drink 2016-2020.
This is dark in color and heavy for Pinot Noir. In fact, it is almost like Syrah, with deep, rich flavors of black cherry jam, brown sugar, chocolate and toast. Good and delicious, but atypical for the variety.
This wine is a blend of Grenache (44%), Mourvèdre (22%), Syrah (14%), Cinsault (13%) and Counoise. It delivers aromas of red fruit, celery stalk, white pepper and herb that lead to ripe full-bodied dark-fruit flavors that offer a lot of enjoyment.
Seems slightly mealy on the nose, and then comes a tired set of flavors that includes mushy apple and spice. Finishes easy but dilute, with a pithiness that's normal for the variety. It's the current vintage but it already seems passé.
Single vineyard, pure varietal, with the focus and tight profile you might expect. Mineral flavors abound—chalk, graphite, and granite— which underscore the bright cranberry and currant fruit. This is a strikingly pure and well-defined Cab Franc.
Wild berry, new leather and menthol aromas meld together on this. The elegant, direct palate shows dried cherry, white pepper and chopped herb alongside austere, close-grained tannins and lively acidity.
This Sangiovese-based blend, which also includes 10% Merlot and a bit of the two Cabs, used to be labeled ‘Rosso'. It is quite ripe, almost cooked, and its flavors are round, sweet, warm, soft and almost tropical. This is not your typical Sangio, what with its flavors of bananas and cherries, and just a hint of tobacco.
Young, sappy and still quite tart, this wine needs a bit more time in the bottle to really pull itself together. Cranberry and raspberry fruit is at the core, clean and lip-smacking, with strong streaks of smoke and char from aging in 50% new French oak.
Ripe and fruity, this forward, candied wine is for those who love ultraripe Zinfandel berry flavors, set in rich baking spices. It's full, forward and powerful, but carries a whiff of burnt rubber and some serious heat in the finish.
Aromas of pineapple, white fruit and apple start this likeable white from Santorini. Citrus, tropical fruit and apple flavors on the palate are fuller bodied but still lively. A solid white for everyday enjoyment.
This starts off great with gobs of melon and other tropical fruits. The palate has refreshing acidity, a medium to full body and an unctuous mouthfeel. The close, however, comes too quickly.
This has a red-brick rim, and mellow aromas and soft texture seem to confirm this is a mature wine that's ready to enjoy. Aromas resemble cranberry and raspberry, while the flavors are more like sweet red cherries and pomegranate seeds. The texture is soft and smooth.
The wine is called “summer pleasure” and its fruitiness and crisp texture seem well-suited. Red cherries, strawberries and a fine line of acidity set the scene for this soft fruity wine. Drink now.
This creamy, rich Pinot Bianco will win you over at first sniff thanks to the intensity and purity of its aromas. You'll get peach, apricot, passion fruit, yellow and a light mineral dusting backed by rich concentration. Pair this wine with crustaceans or risotto con crema di scampi.
Smooth and luscious, with a fragrant nose of bold red fruit, polished oak and earth. The palate comes together with rich cherry and berry fruit, toast, coffee and tannin. The finish is rich, smoky and long, with a delightful texture. Quite the showpiece wine, courtesy of extra-ripe fruit and 18 months in oak.
Creamy notes of Red Delicious apple are tinged with hints of shortbread on the nose. These become more forward on the creamy palate as the frothy mousse amplifies them. This is dry, restrained and elegant with a wonderfully refreshing finish.
Cherry cola, licorice, fresh berry fruit, cigar box and smoky tobacco give this wine a bright, albeit slightly rustic, personality. In the mouth, it shows nicely balanced acidity and tannins, providing extra length to the dry, elegant finish.
The texture is silky on this bright, clean Pinot Noir. With strong, ripe raspberry and cherry jam, date, brown sugar and oak flavors, it's also tasty, and ready to drink now.
A fine balance between sweetness, acidity and astringency drives this wine forward. Acidity lifts the palate and adds freshness, and botrytis adds a drying astringency. Pineapples, prunes and apricots all add their fruity notes to this rich wine. Drink from 2018.
This vineyard-designate Pinot Grigio is nicely executed, with aromas of creamy vanilla, apricot and melon. There's a fragrant touch of yellow rose and even a note of exotic spice that fills in the finish.
Crunchy black and red cherry, raspberry, mint, leather, blue flower and clove are woven together in this balanced wine. It's already accessible with firm but supple tannins and bracing acidity but it time to develop more complexity. Drink after 2018.
Argiano's Suolo is a true standout in the world of Tuscan Sangiovese. It achieves elegance, complexity and richness with bright cherry notes contrasted against sweet vanilla and spicy oak. The finish is long, smooth and persistent.
Good value in a dry Pinot with real Salinas quality. Delicately structured and elegantly crisp, with silky tannins and cherry, cola and herb flavors.
From a value leader, another rich, creamy, toasty Chard, loaded with peach, apple and pear flavors and a lot of oak. Good acidity and a long finish, but it has a little too much sugar to be considered dry.
The grapes for this blend got a little overripe. The alcohol is high and hot, and there's a taste of shriveled raisins. On the plus side is extreme dryness, a long, fruity finish and elegant tannins. Drink up.
Dry Riesling of this quality is capable of aging up to two decades, especially under screw cap. this one is medium bodied and dominated at the moment by ripe, citrusy fruit. It's more orange than lime, yet still shows great acidity and length. Drink 2020–2030.
Layers of new wood show through as a perfumed, minty character. Tannins are firm and dry over the juicy black fruits. The wine is light, fresh and balanced, ready to drink from 2017.
Stemmy on the nose, with aromas of rhubarb, pie cherry and sucking candy. The palate is also candied, with a lean, fresh mouthfeel and floral, red-fruit flavors. Not a lot of darkness or concentration, but it does seem floral and refreshing. Shows some heat and scour on the finish.
Awkward, opening with vegetal aromas that turn cloyingly sweet in the mouth. It's also a very acidic wine. Not offering much charm now.
A very nice Chard that, at seven bucks less than the winery's Premier Reserve, is nearly as good. Dry and crisp in acidity, it has rich honey, pineapple and smoke flavors. How can a wine taste like honey and be dry? It's called magic.
Lots of fresh apple flavors, a crisp balance and smooth mouthfeel make this light-bodied wine refreshing and fun to drink. It has some richness on the midpalate and finish, but basically keeps its lively, tangy personality going.
Blueberry, pepper and cedar aromas and flavors dominate in this structured, elegant red. The wine finishes long with spice and dark cherry notes. A collectible wine that will pair well with poultry, game.
Soft, low-intensity aromas of raisin, marzipan and cedar announce a wine that's not in the best of shape. This feels jammy and lacking in foundation. Flavors of loamy berry, prune and raisin finish with a note of licorice.
I like the dry balance, with its well-crafted tannins, brisk acidity and gentle touch of oak. But the taste is disappointingly thin, showing herb-dominated dill and tobacco, with just a splash of cherry fruit.
Angove's deserves credit for its effort to step up the quality of its wines in the Vineyard Select series. The 2007 Shiraz is a medium-bodied, reasonably structured example of McLaren Vale fruit, balancing bright raspberry and cherry fruit against savory notes of cedar and black olive. Drink 2012–2018.
Ripe red fruits are the main character of this soft, rounded wine. Attractive acidity with grapefruit and lemon zest flavors are balanced by a warmer element.
Raspberry, red currant and a pinch of oaky maple make up the nose on this Tinto Fino that sports a medium-weight body with medium-level intensity. Red-berry flavors follow the nose, while a crisp finish with red plum and raspberry flavors wraps things up.
This is still surprisingly fresh considering the age of this wine. It's simple and enjoyable, with mouthwatering cherry flavors layered with mint and white pepper accents. Pair it with rich pasta dishes.
Good and easy to like, but too oaky by half, with smoky char flavors dominating. Underneath that is a crisply dry, minerally Chardonnay, with fine orange and Meyer lemon flavors. It would be nice to try this as an unoaked wine.
Despite this wine's ample weight, it lacks a bit of generosity, instead leaving behind dry, minerally impressions of pencil shavings and citrus fruits.
Sharp acidity leads to defined flavors of green apple and lemon, maybe even as tart as grapefruit, within this medium-bodied wine with a richness of texture.
Ocone farms organically and this newest vintage of Greco shows interesting aromas of toasted almond and stone fruit offset by citrus and white flower. The wine is fresh and lemony on the close.
This is attractive and mature, with a light touch and flavors of currants mingling with almonds. Soft yet tangy, this is very ready to drink.
This is the first Grüner fruit from Underwood Mountain, and it promises good—maybe great—things to come. Sleek and stony, the wine epitomizes the racy, slightly grassy, slightly peppery quality of classic Austrian Grüner, with a Pacific Northwest twist—a certain brilliant intensity to the fruit that reflects this northern latitude. Clearly the best Grüner from Oregon or Washington to date.
Sourced from The Pines vineyard on the Oregon side of the Columbia Valley, this is a wonderful anomaly for Zin lovers. Loaded with ripe, sweet fruits and accented with a wash of bourbon barrel, this is a riot of blackberry, boysenberry, black cherry and cassis flavors. Just a dash of milk chocolate seeps into the finish. It's too yummy not to drink this up while it's in the first flush of youth.
From Aegerter's own vineyards, this firm wine is packed with tannins as well as concentrated fruits. It shows solid structure and dark fruits, with a juicy, ripe aftertaste. Drink from 2017.
This is a fun discovery, a tantalizing mix of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay grown from estate vineyards in cool, acid-driven sites within the appellation ideal for sparkling. Light pink and gold in color, it celebrates the tangy flavors of pomegranate, strawberry and grapefruit against a mineral-laden backdrop and remarkable depth.
Tastes like good grapes forced into over-production, to judge from the watery finish. It's still a good wine, with blackcurrant flavors, but you wish it was more intense, especially from this historic label.
Tasted multiple times over a 24 hour period, this remained tart and thin. The strawberry fruit had a powdery quality, and the accents of pepper and dried herb dominated. The wine seems to be quickly drying out.
Most of the grapes came from esteemed Dutton vineyards. The wine is enormously ripe. The juice was barrel fermented and aged sur lie. Creamy, packed with tropical fruit and smoky vanilla flavors, it's hedonistically delicious, but almost as sweet as a dessert wine.
This blend of equal parts Merlot, Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon opens with a black fruit aromas and a whiff of toasted oak. The palate delivers ripe plum and black cherry flavors, with a coffee bean accent, presented in a forward and ready-to-drink style.
This is a balanced wine, moving easily between rich fruit and a tight mineral and grapefruit texture. There is a hint of toast to give extra weight. Worth aging for several years.
This rich, impressive wine is full of ripe fruit and balanced acidity. It has intensity, sweetness and botrytis rich enough to lend a dry core. Drink from 2022.
Clos Pepe is one of those vineyards that rarely fails to dazzle, and Roessler has done as good a job at interpreting it as any of the wineries that designate its fruit.

A limited-production wine, fermented in open lagars. It has beautiful perfumes, with touches of violet and sweet spice. With its soft, integrated tannins, this is dense, well proportioned, all in balance.
A pert, savory Sauvignon Blanc, this is brisk with acidity. A tart gooseberry touch shines against a backdrop of pink grapefruits, peaches and limes. A bit of ripeness on the finish will pair well with Vietnamese fare.
This is very rich and forward in raspberry jam and red currant notes, and its fruit is brightened by crisp acidity—like a squirt of lime. It's silky and smoky in oak, if a little direct. Drink now.
This is supersmooth and attractive, with earth, cola, tobacco, balsam and solid berry aromas. The palate rings with vitality, while the flavor profile consists of an ideal mix of vanilla, herb, tomato and berry. Dry on the finish, with a leathery note. Drink now–2018.
From the Sottocastello, “under the castle” cru, comes this silky, polished Barolo. The bouquet here is redolent of exotic spice and church incense and there's plenty of currant berry and forest berry to give the wine a vibrant, youthful personality. But elegance is also present and so are firm tannins that suggest longevity.
This opulent Chianti Classico opens with aromas of violets, black berries, meat juices and spice. The delicious palate delivers concentrated black cherry layered with white pepper, cinnamon, clove and balsamic herbs. It's soft and round but at the same time it boasts alluring intensity.
Comprised of multiple clones from five different vineyards, this exceptional value includes a rich cohesive core of purple fruits, amplified with barrel flavors of toasted coconut and bright spice. Everything is beautifully focused across the full palate, and even after being open for a full 24 hours, the wine tastes fresh and delicious.
A classic South African SB, with dancing acidity, tropical fruit and pear flavors and a touch of rounded, wooded spice. The wine has complexity but is fresh and friendly. Pair with grilled fish or chicken. Imported by GBW, LLC.

This pure Merlot wine from Mayne-Vieil is ripe and rich. Full of jammy blackberry and black plum, it is a generous wine, enveloping the tannins in a cushioned embrace. It is going to develop into a delicious wine. Drink from 2018.
A disappointing effort from this normally reliable winery. There's some dark earth and fruit but it's hard to get at under a veil of charred oak, cellar dirt and alcohol. The finish tastes of coffee grounds. The mouthfeel is fine, the flavors just don't come together. —J.C.
A soft, plump wine, with ripe flavors of black and red cherries, red currants, licorice, milk chocolate and cinnamon. Drink now.
This is a smooth and rich Amarone with equal parts jammy fruit set against a smokey oak component. The wine slides nicely over the palate with a lavish, velvety texture and imparts more oak spice and mesquite on the close.
Licorice, blackberry, cassis and plum aromas are concentrated and fruity. This feels fresh, with choppy tartaric acidity creating high tones across the mouthfeel. Baked blackberry flavors are limited but good, while a jammy, black-fruit finish is smooth, with just enough bracing acidity.
Deeply saturated with blackberry and plum flavors, this powerful, boldly structured Merlot balances rich fruit with complex shades of earth and mineral. Umami-rich whiffs of soy sauce and hay linger from nose to finish, hinting towards its development. It's pleasant now, but should meld considerably through 2019.
While black plum and cherry flavors seem ruddy and ripe on the nose, the palate of this medium-bodied Bordeaux blend is surprisingly brisk. Lean in style and delicate in concentration, it's a crisp and elegant sip. Firm, fine tannins accentuate the finish.
Small percentages of other white grapes are added to this Brut Prosecco for extra depth and personality. The wine showcases aromas of stone fruit, white flower and loads of crushed mineral. It is lively and smooth with piquant bubbling on the close.
This has appealing scents of cherry fruit at first, then it quickly hits a wall and stops short. No amount of breathing time can make it budge.
Dark and savory more than jumpy and candied, and with that this is more serious than most everyday Spanish Garnachas. The palate is pumped up and ripe, with dark berry, black plum and licorice flavors. Along the way a hint of herb and tomato are noticeable, but for the most part this is well-comported, round-bodied Grenache.
This wine is light, juicy and with attractive red fruits brightened with acidity. The tannins suggest a little aging, but there is no need to wait. This Beynat property has been in the family since 1917.
Soft and silky, this wine shows rich chocolate flavor and is light in oak and fleshy on the palate. Full-bodied and ripe, it finishes in a grip of dust.
Very juicy and ripe, this is a fruity, blackberry flavored wine. The ripe feeling is cut through by acidity and solidified by tannins, making it a rich wine that will be ready to drink from 2016.
The herb, grapefruit, tropical fruit and melon aromas are light but very varietal. The palate has a slight spritz that perks up the tangy fruit flavors.

Ever-present tannins form a backdrop for flavors of blackberry, ripe summer cherry, vanilla and black pepper that are heightened by opulent floral notes. The finish offers a pleasing amalgam of rose petal and cherry pie.
Not easily identifiable as Sauvignon Blanc, but not a bad wine, per se. The nose has a cake-like sweetness, while the palate is sugary, with apple and lime accents. A basic wine with a candied personality.
This 100% Albariño from Ribeiro shows light orange blossom aromas. It's chunky and almost chewy, with lightly pithy citrus flavors and roundness to the palate. Finishes a touch pithy and bitter, with white pepper notes. May already be starting to fade; drink right away.
This is a thick, modern wine—the color is impenetrable and dark—with pronounced aromas of dark chocolate, spice, crushed black pepper and deep oak shadings. It has firm structure followed by a generous texture that gives it staying power and persistency. As far as Valpolicella goes, this is a very impressive wine.
Compost and strong herbal aromas lead to a rubbery palate with stewed tomato and leathery flavors. A salty, rubbery tasting finish fails to bring this around.
A rich plummy shade carries you into an aromatic fruity wine with a tart mix of plums and cherries. It's just this side of candied, and there's an intriguing suggestion of peppermint. All in all it's quite tasty, clean and ready for immediate enjoyment.
On the sweet side, but it's also crisp, with enough zesty acidity to provide balance. Floral, apple-y and refreshingly light, this is a fine picnic wine. A chalky note gives added depth to the finish.

Light on the nose, offering touches of pear, vanilla and spice. Veers toward crisp lime and orange in the mouth, with even more citrus on the finish. Runs juicy and lean, but mostly it's clean.
Waxy, floral white-fruit aromas are tropical in style. This feels citrusy, with some pulpiness to the texture. Tangerine, orange and nectarine flavors finish tangy and citric, with one-dimensional juiciness.
An unusual blend of 60% Tannat and 40% Montepulciano, the first from Greece (or anywhere), this has a beautiful nose of cured meat, fresh crushed berries, and vibrant vanilla. Tannat's heavy tannins are present, as is plentiful acidity. Dark purple fruit and vanilla flavors are pure and modern, but this wine would be better if it wasn't so tart.
Rich but fresh, with good aromatic intensity. Flavors are of white fruits, in a soft style, with nougat and honey, and a drier, crisper character than previous bottlings of this wine. The aftertaste is fresh and lively.
Dusty cherry, wild berry and minerally aromas comprise a compact, deep nose that's entirely inviting.

It's elegant, complete and thorough on the finish; drink through 2020.
Hits with force as well as notes of raisin and Sherry. No doubt this comes from a hot vintage, evidenced by the prune, brandied cherry and chocolate flavors. Still there's some tannin to keep it moving ahead. Overall, however, it's pretty heavy and condensed.
This smells sweet and rubbery up front. The palate is tannic, with a blackberry flavor that starts sweet but turns bitter.
This wine shows tremendous minerality for a wine from a mix of parcels. Almost smoky, saline mineral aromas combine with crisp, citrusy fruit to typify the Pfalz dry Riesling style. Picks up hints of orange and clove on the finish, with a suggestion of citrus pith.

One of two Sparkman Syrahs, Darkness showcases fruit from two stellar Yakima valley vineyards, Boushey and Olsen. A whiff of Syrah funk, herb and earth ties into dried blueberry with a brambly, plummy component. Lovely details of nutmeg with a streak of vanilla keep the flavors interesting through a long finish.
Quite a good wine, but the powerful oak is a bit intrusive at this time. It swamps the mouth with caramel and crème brûlée. Below all that seems to be a fine, pineapple-flavored Chardonnay. Everything may knit together in a year or so.
After “fiddling around,” as he puts it, with blends in his '96 and '97 cabs, winemaker Alex Golitzin decided to go with straight Cabernet in '98, an exceptional vintage for Washington State. This is a tight, focused effort, with powerful black fruits augmented with herbs and spices and a hint of mineral. Young, tart and tannic, it will continue to improve as it knits together over the years. Editors' Choice.
A pretty wine, with flavors of flowers and cream that have some heft. The finish is austere yet refreshing, with a lemony note. Easy drinking, this is a Pinot Gris that would pair well with tangy seafood.
Merlot remains a solid strength at Dumas Station, thanks to the Minnick Hills and Birch Creek Vineyard fruit. Half the barrels were new, an equal percentage of French and American oak, lending a strong bourbon aroma, along with tobacco and vanilla components. The fruit remains a bit constrained, with black fruits leading into a core of cassis. Give this one a good decanting.
Smooth, rounded wine, with vanilla, ripe pear and a bitter herbal finish. The wine feels fat, unfocused.

Hints of mint on the nose give added nuance to this unusual, almost honeyed-tasting Sauvignon Blanc. Oranges and vanilla-cream are complemented by toast notes from aging in French oak.
With 50% fermentation, this is a ripe, toasty wine, the wood balanced by a great citric swipe. Bright white fruits and wild flower perfumes give the wine a great lift.

The estate wine from Casal Branco is impressive and structured, with dried berry fruits, dark, dry tannins and a solid structure. The acidity is very present, helping to keep the wine fresh, but the complex dark flavors and spice are certainly there to allow the wine to age over the next 3–4 years.
Lascombes seems to have got into its stride even in a difficult vintage such as this. Ripe black-berry fruits are there along with firm, balanced wood and spice flavors that give promise of some aging. The wood still has to calm down as the fruit develops, so don't drink until 2019.
Cidery apple and stone-fruit aromas are fresh and basic. This blend includes Chardonnay, Macabeo and Parellada, and it's a lively number with spritz and citric acidity. Orange and tangerine flavors remain zesty and snappy on the finish.
Thick black cherry, ripe raspberry, Indian spice, toasted almond, molasses, Spanish cedar and sweet vanilla open the nose of this beautiful Riserva Amarone. It's a smooth, rich wine with loads of mature berry intensity on the close.
This is a dense wine that has plenty of fresh fruit to support its weight. It's quite tannic though, so enjoy with food. It could also do with time, so wait two years.
Fruity and clean, with a simple structure that shows fruit, spice and butter-cream flavors. Doesn't seem varietally correct.
The nose is shy, showing just a few herbal hints reminiscent of yarrow. Frothy bubbles, however, pronounce the varietal character of Grüner Veltliner, revealing an appealing textural element as well as herb-tinged pear fruit. Fresh, dry and light on its feet, this would be a lovely apéritif.
Subdued aromas recall leafy undebrush, red berries and grilled herbs. The brisk palate offers red berry, espresso, mocha and clove alongside fresh acidity. It's simple but well made and will pair well with everything from grilled vegetables to mildly seasoned cheeses.
The cool 2011 vintage was kind to Calera's Viognier, helping to rein in the fruit which sometimes can be overwhelming. You still get plenty of tropical fruit and honeysuckle flavor, but it's just part of a package that also includes acidity, oak and minerals.
Simple and sweet, with jammy flavors of blackberries and cherries, and lacking the acidity for vibrancy.
Dark, robust, dry, full bodied, tannic and acidic. That pretty much sums up this old-fashioned, young wine. It's a serious cellar candidate, stuffed with blackberry jam, leather and coffee flavors. Best after 2010 and for years beyond.

Raspberry and oak flavors are pleasant, but unripe vegetal flavors diminish the pleasure of this wine, adding hints of boiled asparagus.
An inspired co-mingling of 66% Cabernet Sauvignon, 19% Merlot and 15% Sangiovese, this wine offers swirls of spicy cinnamon, plum and tobacco. Rounded on the palate and balanced, while rich, the finish delves into clove and black pepper.

A blend of Monastrell, Tempranillo and Syrah that's ripe and raisiny but still fresh enough to earn its stripes. The nose is powerful and intense, with a sweet, baked character, while the palate tastes naturally rich but restrained, with blackberry and jammy finishing notes.
Meaty, dry, lightly herbal berry aromas are reserved and not too pushy. This is choppy feeling on the palate, with pointed acids. Flavors of herbal berry, dark plum, coconut, chocolate and oak finish fresh, long, juicy and oaky.
Probably Salomon's star wine, this rich, concentrated Riesling brings together ripe white fruits, evocative honeysuckle perfume and a luxurious, creamy texture. Yet, despite all this richness, it remains elegant, poised, the epitome of fine Riesling, worth aging for at least three years. Glass stopper.
A big, burly proprietary red blend, Voluptous combines Cabernet Sauvignon with smaller percentages of Syrah, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Zinfandel , creating a rich, darkly fruited wine with dusty tannins. Well-structured despite its girth, it delivers layers of licorice and leather on the finish. Drink now.

Oak and woodsy underbrush aromas take center stage in this blend of 70% Montepulciano and 30% Sangiovese. The palate shows blackberry flavors, rubber, vanilla and espresso notes, alongside abrasive tannins.
From a tiny hillside block in Rutherford, this 100% Cab is soft in clove, black currant and olive, juicy yet restrained. It spent almost two years in 90% new French oak, but the presence of oak is subtle and the tannins well-managed, making the wine both enjoyable now and worth cellaring through 2020.
With the appetizing scent of lemon-spiked pear sorbet, it delivers breezy refreshment. A tight, linear body is displayed against a mineral backdrop. The finish is softer than expected, like a caress.
The same pungency that dominates St. Supery's Dollarhide Sauvignon Blanc is here, even though this proprietarily-named wine is mostly Semillon. But a little bit of strong Sauvignon Blanc goes a long way. Otherwise, this is a rich, barrel-fermented and lees-aged wine of considerable interest and complexity.
This medium weight red is not unpleasant, yet fails to achieve a graceful balance. One has to wonder why all the wood? The oak over-indulgence renders the wine decidedly drier and more one-dimensional than it need be, as the fruit struggles to present itself.
Aromas of apple, fresh hay, pineapple and natural vanilla draw you in, while the palate is lively and fresh, with citrus, pineapple and pithy lemon flavors. Juicy, clean and zesty on the finish, and chiseled in terms of structure and acidity. Very nice Albariño for the price.
Warm, baked aromas smell of clay and raisin, and later a wave of minty green enters the picture. The palate is sort of lean, with some holes in the fabric, while flavors of wild berry and black fruits fold in a heavier note of molasses. Limited in its virtues; short in complexity.
Pale in color and silky in body, this defines a lighter style of Pinot, although the alcohol isn't particularly low. It bears flavors of black raspberry, Dr. Pepper and cinnamon spice.
A difficult Pinot Noir to evaluate. It's very dry, acidic and tannic, with sharp flavors of blackberries that sweeten into jam on the finish. The question is one of ageability. Try cellaring for five years and see what happens.
Rosemount's Diamond Label Chardonnay used to be a terrific value, so it is encouraging to see its quality once again on the rise. Smoky notes add complexity to the bold pear and melon fruit in this plump, harmonious wine; drink it over the next few months.
The striking aromas of cantaloupe, nectarine, flower-blossom honey and currant bud are slightly tainted with a sulfurous note of expired matchstick. Sprightly acids lend the rich palate a vivacious quality. The medium-long finish fades with a flavor of Orange Tang.
This opens with aromas of underbrush, woodland berry, exotic spice, sage and a balsamic note. The palate delivers black cherry, spiced blueberry, licorice and white pepper framed in firm, close-grained tannins. Drink through 2020. A coffee note closes the finish.
Very acidic, giving the ripe tropical fruit and green pea flavors an almost sparkling spritziness. But very rich and flamboyant and complex. This wine was tasted at just about a year of age, and should calm down by summer 2012.
This grape's traditional petrol aromas arise on this dry bottling, backed up with sweeter lemon curd and tangerine peel. The palate is quite soft and full, but there is a vibrant acidity, powered by flavors of lime rind and Bosc pear, with a long lingering finish.
A ripely smooth, polished wine, the new wood a major constituent of its character. It has a severe structure, dark and concentrated, but the texture of the very ripe fruit is rounded, jammy, giving a more generous potential. Age for at least five years.
An awkward wine that's hard to warm up to. There's a sharpness in the mouthfeel, with minty cherry flavors and a tannic, slightly sweet, cough drop finish.

It's focused and vibrant, with notes of white pepper, graphite and rusted iron adding depth to the red-cherry and crushed-raspberry core. Elegant tannins and fresh acidity provide the framework. Drink 2018–2025.
This wine is much more convincing than Jenke's 2005 Cabernet, reinforcing the concept that Barossa Cab typically performs better in cooler years (2002 was the coolest on record). It's still broad and mouthfilling, but the plum and cassis flavors stay this side of overripe, buttressed by plenty of smoke, vanilla and spice. Long and savory on the finish. Drink now–2015. Imported by 34th Parallel, LLC.
Tasted side-by-side with the Neyen 2009, this younger wine is more vital and strapping. Spicy aromas of herbal berry and cassis come with a tree-bark accent. This is well cut but delivers good body and weight, while flavors of herbal plum and berry are spicy and finish earthy and loamy. Drink through 2020.
This is a lightly style wine but extremely vivacious and sexy, with cut red apple, mandarin orange skin, ripe nectarine and lightly honeyed Gravenstein apple on the nose. It's clean, crisp and focused on the palate, where lime zest, limestone and a touch of buttered pear in the midpalate makes for a complete and balanced sip.
Smoke and musk notes dissipate with aeration to reveal aromas of ripe stone fruit and floral tones. The palate is dry and intensely tart with a piercing lemon-lime acidity. It's a focused, rather linear wine with a steely, mineral finish.
Foster's should be a happy new owner of this property. Here there's a concentrated bouquet of smoky, toasty oak and full red fruit backed up by tobacco, bitter chocolate and buttery oak. If you are a fan of heavily wooded wines you'll love this. It finishes extremely smooth and long.
This blend of Marsanne, Roussanne and Viognier displays aromas of almond, corn husk and apricot. There's a pleasing, nuanced feel to the sweet, full-bodied fruit flavors along with a finish that won't quit.
Dry, full-bodied and tannic, it will deal well with a cheeseburger or barbecued ribs. Flavors include blackberry jam and dark chocolate.

Despite its age, it starts tight as a drum, with light aromas of spice, dark cherry, coffee and dried flowers. It's full flavored, with a dazzling richness to the textured fruit and barrel notes. Best after 2021.
Eric Hamacher has done a fine job with this wine. At 13.6% alcohol it is in fine balance, with a precise mix of strawberry, pie cherry, root beer and herb flavors. It's medium bodied, open and accessible, but not too simple. There is no reason to wait, but it could be cellared for up to six years.
One of a series of single parcel wines from the Chermette family estate, this is dark and rich. It has generous tannins alongside the dark cherry and plum fruit. The cru wine's structure and richness will allow it to age. Drink from 2018.
There's something sharp and vegetal to this wine despite a generous helping of sweet oak.
A little rough and common in the mouth, with jagged tannins and some green peppercorn flavors. But for the price, it's fruity enough in raspberries and cherries, making it a good buy. Production was nearly 100,000 cases.
Aromas of baking spices and pears lead the way, followed by flavors of pear and pineapple. This medium-bodied wine has a pleasantly toasty-grainy note as well, then finishes crisp and citrusy.

This Chardonnay opens with fluffy, vanilla-like aromas that thicken to a custardlike density after a few minutes in the glass. As you'd expect, buttery, oaky accents are present on the palate, too, but its core is bright and citrusy. Folks who like a Chard with plenty of creamy fluff on its bones may find this score stingy. Imported by Click Wine Group.

Ripe, perfumed wine that has an immediately appealing richness. It feels opaque in its density, layering tannins upon fruit with a luxurious, velvet feel. The result is a wine that is almost drinkable now, but which will age.
Fresh from the vineyard, this Pinot Grigio from the 2007 vintage is bright and zesty in tart lemon, lime, apple and vanilla flavors, with a sweeter edge of figs. It finishes with a crisp, honeyed aftertaste.

A blend of Sangiovese and 20% Merlot, this offers aromas of red currant, espresso, aromatic herb and French oak. The taut palate shows tart red cherry, coffee, toast, star anise and powdered sage while close-grained tannins leave an astringent, mouth-puckering finish.
Aromas suggesting scorched soil, cedar and black-skinned berry are front and center. The concentrated palate delivers black plum, clove and licorice alongside chewy tannins. Enjoy this one through 2020.
With its high percentage of Champagne's third grape, Pinot Meunier, as a result of the growing conditions of 2003, this is a great wine that is developing fast. It has more toast, less fruit, although its richness and weight are finely in balance with a yeasty cookie dough character.
Green and yellow pear notes make an immediate appearance on the nose of this wine Its zippy, easy-drinking palate is enlivened with spritz and brings that characteristic savory, yeasty herb flavor to bear. Fresh, easy, dry and light, it finishes zesty and clean.
Light in color, this sparkling wine is somewhat diluted in flavor, coming off as slightly sweet, with a nutty metallic edge to it.
Delicious in blackberry and cherry jam, currant and sweetly smoked cedar wood, with a rich edge of milk chocolate, sprinkled with anise and cinnamon. Could be firmer in structure, as it's a little soft and melted, and probably best now.
This Southern Italian wine fits more into the mold of traditional than modern. By that we mean it's lean, elegant and not overly extracted. The fruit is earthy and mildly stewed, but good acidity keeps it fresh on the palate. Look for flavors of rhubarb, cranberry and cherry along with hints of raisin and earth.
Super-fruity now, almost too much so for a sparkling wine. Tastes like a Chardonnay with bubbles. But of course the wine is still young at the age of six-plus years. It wants time in the cellar. Should develop slowly and well over the next decade, acquiring nutty, dried fruit and honey complexities.
A pretty wine that shows elegance in its structure. Mostly Sauvignon Blanc, with a splash of Sémillon, it's not truly dry, with a sweetly jammy finish. Shows oak-inspired flavors of pineapples, Key lime pie, honeysuckle and vanilla.

The grapes for this limited-production wine come from the outstanding Alloro vineyard. The texture and complexity are immediately apparent. Mouthcoating plum and cherry fruit combines with lively citrus, toasty oak and a rich chocolate note. Drink now or put some away for a few years, but don't miss this one.
There's a sweetmeat, salty leatheriness to this Pinot, like beef jerky. Give it a year or so to mellow out and let the smoky oak integrate with the ripe cherry, cola and raspberry flavors. Decant for an hour or two if you pop it open now.
This 100% Grenache was aged in neutral French oak. It's dry in style, but rich, with flavors of raspberries, strawberries, cherries and toast. An edge of acidity adds verve.
Deep purple in color, this bottling by John and Helen Falcone expertly balances the richness of ripe fruit from eastern Paso with the savory and spiciness provided by Syrah.

It's ready to drink right now, but will last for years as well.

Sharp in acidity, which gives the mouthfeel excessive tartness. Otherwise it's a very rich wine, with deep, complex flavors of cherry preserves, raspberries, cola, cranberries and red currants, accented by smoky oak. The sharpness seems to limit ageability.
Here's a delicious Amarone, with aromas of spirit-soaked black cherry and spice. The palate is rich but refined, with succulent black cherry, raspberry and plum flavors all layered with nutmeg and white pepper accents.
Very strong white peach and lemon blossom aromas meet with roasted chicken, honeysuckle and chamomile on the nose of this bottling. Apple, pear and nectarine show on the palate, as does fresh cherimoya, graphite and more white peach toward the finish.
This drinks a bit lighter than previous vintages, with light strawberry and thin, tart cherry fruit. The tannins are astringent and slightly green. It's worth cellaring until 2019 to let additional bottle age smooth out the finish.
Apple and honeyed aromas are round and ripe. The palate is chunky and easy, but with good acidity. Flavors revolve around apple and peach, while the finish is linear and direct. Ripe and solid wine from a good vintage for Albariño.
This is a darkly colored Shiraz, and the aromas follow in that vein: coffee and cola scents along with dark fruit. Yet the wine isn't a big heavyweight; instead, those scents are joined by similar flavors, plus hints of dried fruit and black olives and an unusually crisp, acidic finish. Imported by USA Wine West.
Right off the bat you can taste the acidity in this wine, which is brighter and crisper than, say, the winery's Russian River Pinot. The tartness lifts the black cherry, cherry and raspberry flavors, heightening their impact through the long, spicy finish. Still, it's a wine for early drinking.
This very interesting expression of Sangiovese is light in color but bursting with small berry and floral fragrances. The wine does a lovely job of showing the elegant, feminine side of this Tuscan grape variety.
Classic Shiraz. Tart sweet berry flavors and ample oak are in full play. It's already flavorful and well-balanced, with even, smooth tannins. Should be even better in six to twelve months.
Farmed according to certified biodynamic and organic practices, this is an impressively clean and bright, with flavors of tangy citrus, spice and plump stone fruit. A touch of white mountain flower shades in the finish.

This lovely, layered wine from the Santa Ynez Valley-based producer shows iron, cranberry, shiitake, cola and cherry on the nose. Those same elements are delicately woven into the palate, enhanced by a Sichuan peppercorn kick and vibrant acidity that will ensure a long life ahead.

Light banana flambée, vanilla meringue and yellow-cake aromas show on the generous but not overbearing nose of this blend of 49% Grenache Blanc, 31% Viognier, 12% Roussanne and 8% Marsanne. The tropicality of the nose disappears on the palate, which is tart and grippy with green apple and Anjou pear flavors as well as a touch of melon and smoke.
Fresh, crisp, lightly grassy flavors make this wine instantly refreshing. There are touches of apricots and green plums, and a center which is ripe and full.
A little ungainly now, this Bordeaux-style blend is dominated by fierce tannins. Nothing has integrated yet. The oak sticks out over here, the very ripe black currant and cherry fruit over there. A potential problem is the sugary sweetness that causes imbalance. As this wine ages, something slight now may turn out to be huge later.
A good success for Davis Family, this Pinot is rich in flavor and elegant in structure. With a layering of toasted oak, it features ripe raspberries and cherries, with an earthy touch of herbs, mushrooms and spices. Drink now.

It's a beautiful effort, and really shines at this price point.
Bruna Grimaldi is a boutique winery that shows great promise for the future. The wine's delicate nuances of forest fruit, cola, pressed violets, white chocolate and coffee are what set it apart. In the mouth, this elegant Barolo offers a tight, streamlined feel.
This appealing wine features notes of woodspice, herbs, mint, coffee and jammy red fruit. It's full bodied in feel with coffee and red fruit flavors that linger.
The “X” designation refers to the number of clones in this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon. You have to search for the richness—buried so deeply now—but it's there, like a pirate treasure of blackberries, black currants and cassis liqueur. Hard, thick and resistant now, it's framed by astringent tannins and a dryness that's almost arid. Charles Krug clearly built this wine to age, and there's no reason it shouldn't. Your window begins in 2018 and should last a very long time.
Miserere offers most of what you'd expect from a high-end Priorat red. The nose features mineral, grilled meat, raisin, berry, cherry and even a citrusy accent. The palate has a full, complete feel and warm flavors of black cherry, licorice and raisin. Very nice but one step short of excellence. Drink now through 2012.

Textbook Saar kabinett, still wearing a some youthful leesy accents on the nose, but crisp and pure on the palate. Citrus and green apple aromas broaden ever so slightly into melon and pear flavors in the mouth, then return to crystal clear focus on the finish.
Rare are the places that Cabernet Franc produces a distinctive wine. In fact, no savory Russian River Valley examples come to mind. This wine suggests the difficulties. Very tannic and raw, highly acidic, and although it's dark in color, lacking fruity extract. Nor is it a wine to age. It's barren now, and not going anywhere. —S.H.

Delicate layers of smoke, vanilla and spice lavish this textured Chardonnay that's remarkably light on its feet.

Despite it's considerable size, this silky wine is fresh and vibrant. Black currants and cherries lead the way, tinged with herbal notes suggestive of mint and lavender. Drink now–2020.
This is a juicy wine with its red fruits and attractive acidity. The wood aging still shows, perhaps too strongly, but that fruit is already a major factor in the success of the wine. Drink from 2019.
Neither oak aging nor malolactic fermentation was used here, hence the name. But far from madness, this wine is sleek, sensual, skillful and seductive. Crisp acidity, lemony minerality, an overriding freshness and excellent depth of flavor all combine to create a wine that seems to be more than the sum of its parts. Shellfish, light seafood, poultry and even pork dishes would be fine matches.
From a single, high-elevation block of the Alden-Ellis Vineyard, this is somewhat muted aromatically, preferring to present itself in waves of oak and cigar box. Big tannins and weight surround a soft, approachable palate that's ready to enjoy now.
A first-rate Chardonnay, solidly exhibiting the house style of dry, elegant complexity. It's the most Chablisian of Hobbs' recent vintages, with brilliant acidity and minerality giving the tropical fruit and oak flavors a stony grounding. It would not be surprising if this wine ages well for six years or so.
Dry, scratchy and rooty smelling, with balsam wood and earthy berry aromas. Medium-bodied, with gritty tannins, herb and spice flavors, and basic but solid cherry and berry fruit. A touch oaky and hot on the finish.
The dominance of Cabernet Sauvignon in Figeac has really shone through in 2006. It has produced a dark, serious wine, mineral, austere and still very young. But there is weight there; the black berry fruits show over the tannin and the wood and dry core integrate well with this fruit. The finish is surprisingly fresh after all this structure. But the wine does need aging.
Good balance and a sense of proportion characterize this handsome, classically styled Chianti. Displays aromas of cherry, leather and spice and dark-cherry flavors, cocoa accents and nice acidity on the palate. The long and flavorful finish makes it very appealing for current consumption, and it should improve further over the next year or two.
Compared with the generally more delicate offerings from this producer, Bucher is always a standout. It's a raunchy, earthy barnyard expression of rustic cheese rind and dark cherry that symbolizes its origins in outstanding ways. Lively acidity keeps it fresh in the glass, while cardamon, rosemary and Asian spice provide the intrigue.
Solid up front, with sweet and spicy aromas of plum, vanilla and candied berry. Feels full and good, with weight and thickness boosting up toasty, woody berry flavors. Dries out on the finish, leaving spice and a resiny taste. Drink now through 2014.

The fruit nuances are simple but clean and offer a good match to pasta, roasted vegetables and white meat. The best quality of this wine, however, is the finish that is long and exceedingly fruity.
Dehours makes a range of single cépage Champagnes from specific parcels of old vines. This parcel of Pinot Noir in Mareuil-le-Port was aged in wood before blending, giving a superbly ripe, quite toasty, spicy character. It does need time, and is obviously a wine for aging, but even now it has great, ripe peach and lemongrass flavors. Not imported.

Three quarters of this wine was sourced from Taptiel, and 20% from neighboring Artz vineyard, both on Red Mountain. A 5% addition of Petit Verdot came from Dionysus.

Fruity and front-loaded, with a tongue-tingling mouthfeel. The tasty black cherry fruit quickly fills the mouth with a burst of fresh fruit. The wine is designed for near-term enjoyment.
Winemaker Dani Schuster is making his Riesling in a spätlese style, keeping some residual sugar for balance, with only 10.5% alcohol.

Delicious now, but should also age well for 5–10 years.
This is the first ever release of this reserve-style Sauvignon Blanc from Grgich Hills, but it's not a very good wine. It's semisweet and simple, with sugary LifeSaver candy and green-pea flavors.
Sometimes you need a sturdy wine for a decadent TV night with pepperoni and sausage pizza. This velvety-rich Montepulciano fits the bill perfectly, thanks to its aromas of spice, blackberry, cinnamon and moist tobacco.
Plum-jam-flavored wine, this is very sweet, rich and very direct. The freshness is here, but this is more about the dense, superripe fruits.
A pretty, floral nose adds a surprising dimension to this wine, but on the palate, the flavors fall somewhat flat. A good balance of oak and fruit prevails, but the nose suggests more.

You'll feel the heat in this sun-drenched Amarone that offers a chewy consistency and a pleasingly firm but smooth texture. Aroma-wise, there's a lot going on: First are notes of mature cherry fruit, but there are also green, almost eucalyptus-like renderings. On top of those are coffee, bacon and cocoa.
The winery's proprietary block of Zin grapes (planted in 1999) from the coveted Stagecoach Vineyards contributes to an intense wine. Juicy and oaky, it's dense in cherry and plum, a note of lavender and sage complementing the whole. A thick liqueur sense characterizes the texture, but the palate stays alive through the site's rocky minerality. This one'll age.
Concentrated aromas of violets and rose buds meet with black raspberry on the nose of this bottling.

Full-bodied and ripely fruity, this has attractive strawberry fruits and a round texture. The acidity adds some freshness.
Opens with beautiful Gewurz aromas like honeysuckle, plum blossom, vanilla, fresh peaches and white chocolate. But this early promise of great taste isnÕt fulfilled. In the mouth the wine is disappointingly thin. The finish reveals some spicy peach flavors.
Delicious, dry and complex, with wild blackberry, Provençal herb, white pepper and sandalwood flavors. Feels elegant, but too soft, lacking the structural integrity a fine wine needs. Drink now.
This dry wine has a nice sense of reserve along with subtle lemony, earthy and milky flavors that linger on the finish. The texture has a nip of acidity and the body is light to medium.

A gaseous smelling nose and a chunky palate are not motivational, while flavors of banana and melon aren't much better. Overall, this is a basic Verdejo that's starting to fade.
Pressed wild flower, hay, fennel and ripe berry scents mingle together in the glass. The refreshing palate combines crushed strawberry, juicy red cherry, saline and a hint of baking spice alongside bright acidity.
Dark smokiness hovers above the fruit, slightly obscuring the view. Firm tannins, however, hold a core of bright, ripe but tart red berries. This is tightly framed and needs time to evolve. A slender but warm body is built on firm structure. Drink as of 2016.
Planeta was among the first to bring this delicious sweet wine to the United States and demonstrate that great Sicilian dessert wines hail from places besides Pantelleria. There's a light, buoyant quality that is enhanced by fragrant floral tones of jasmine, honeysuckle and peach blossom. There's no better pairing for sweet almond cookies.
A great everyday Chardonnay with buttered toast, buttered popcorn, pineapple-orange jam and vanilla flavors. Delicate Santa Lucia acidity provides crispness.
A subtle, pretty nose of vanilla, cherry and strawberry is backed up by bigger flavors of sour cherry, spice and vanilla. Fun and exuberant but not terribly delicate. A good match with meats and poultry.

As good as Herzog's Special Reserve Cab is, this one is better. It has the same ripely fruity currant and cassis flavors, with fine tannins and a luxurious coating of oak that has been judiciously applied. But it goes the extra mile in finesse and balance, and is simply superb. Right up there with the best, and a considerable success for the vintage.

A similar but bigger version of the Whistle Stop Red, this is made of all Cabernet, bearing rather hard tannins and flavors of coffee and clean earth. It's a good choice to pair with grilled cuts of beef.

A good, classy wine, showing refined Napa tannins and acidity, and flavors of blackberries and cassis. There's a hole in the middle that shows the challenges of making Petit Verdot, traditionally a blending wine, on its own.
Alluring aromas of violet, rose and dark-skinned fruit lead the way on this elegantly structured wine. The firm palate delivers young red cherry, white paper, grilled herb and pipe tobacco alongside fine-grained tannins.
Robust and stemmy, with soupy, herbal aromas that lean toward mint and tomato. The acidity is high, and thus the raspberry/red cherry flavors are lean and tart, as is the finish. Rather sour and leafy; an underachiever.
A streak of lemon-lime acidity jolts the senses on this unctuously ripe Riesling full of sweet orange and tangerine flavors. It's dancing and light on it's feet, yet powerfully packed with honey and nectar. Penetrating and persistent on the palate.
What a nice wine this is. It's dry and balanced, and although there's a complex structure of tannins, it's drinkable now. The flavors veer between blackberries, plums, coffee, leather and dusty spices.
Dry and crisp in acidity, with a silky texture, this is a polished Pinot Noir for drinking now. It has a rich array of cherry pie and sweet oak flavors, with earthier notes of pomegranate and cola.
For white Hermitage, this is tight and minerally, with more structure than Chapoutier's other microcuvées and possibly more aging potential. There's a bit of truffle on the nose, but it's not so exotic as the De L'Orée, nor so rich and fat as Le Méal. Finishes with tremendous length and minerality.
This firm wine has smoky tannins and red-currant acidity. It is still young, its structure still dry and solid. Wait until the end of 2016 before drinking.
Scents of butterscotch candies, vanilla custard, apple mousse and sea salt greet the nose in a subtle manner on this wine by Steve Clifton. The palate is framed with bright acidity and tight minerality, with almonds and pecans slowly emerging toward a dynamic finish of white truffle and nectarine. It's a very intriguing, lovely wine.
This is a big wine on the nose, with lemon curd, vanilla cream, hot pie crust and white and yellow flowers mixing into a very lush invitation. The palate shows great restraint, though, with lemon peels and pudding balanced by a tight line of lime pith.
An earthy touch of freshly turned soil clings to the pure apple note on the nose. On the absolutely dry palate, however, a beautifully lithe, serene but all-encompassing cloud of lemon freshness just steals the show. It pervades and informs nose, palate and mind. Its luminosity and vivacious freshness just soars and sings. Yes, this is uncompromising. You have to like freshness, acidity and unflinching honesty to be a fan of this, but if you are, this is a ticket to vinous heaven. Wow. This is a real experience and a celebration of site and variety. Hoard this if you can. Gorgeous and fresh now, but far too young. Drink 2022–2040.
A slightly sour red-apple and light strawberry aroma meets with a touch of watermelon and cotton candy on the nose of this blend of 76% Grenache, 10% Syrah, 8% Mission, 4% Zinfandel and 2% Cinsault. There is lots of citrus zing to the nectarine-driven palate, which also shows some pink-lemonade flavors.
Toasty aromas abound, and the acidity is well integrated with the fruit and biscuit flavors. Pure brioche and ripeness. Ready to drink.
Fruity and lightweight, this is softly tannic, with red fruit flavors. It's open and juicy, confirming that this is not a wine for more than medium-term aging.
This is marked by bold, dense and rich fruit. It has a sweet, soft character and is deliciously fruity. Packed with blackberry-juice acidity and ripe red plum, this is ready to drink now.
This radiant, fragrant Nebbiolo opens with a potpourri of scents including aromatic herb, leather, cedar, pressed rose petal and dark spice. The luminous, subtle palate is loaded with finesse, delivering juicy red cherry, cinnamon, star anise, white pepper and pipe tobacco. It's impeccably balanced, with noble tannins and bright acidity. Drink now or hold for even more complexity. Drink through 2032.
Here's a rich and layered blend of Barbera and Cabernet Sauvignon from Piedmont, Italy with deep layers of black fruit, spice, mesquite wood and chocolate. The wine is modern and very likeable with rich density and long-lasting flavors. The mouthfeel is smooth, round and there's a slightly sweet vanilla note on the close.
Deliciously drinkable, this is one of the best California Grenaches in recent memory. Complexity is not Grenache's strong point, but lusciousness is, when the wine is well made. The cherry pie filling, raspberry tart and cinnamon spice flavors, enriched with smoky sandalwood, are wrapped into pure, fine tannins. Drink now.
Very rich and ripe, showing pineapple tart and oak-infused vanilla, meringue and buttered toast aromas and flavors. A bit lacking in structure, though, with a soft, melted mouthfeel. Could be firmer and crisper to balance all that decadence.
This wine opens with intense aromas of smoked bacon, leather, black fruit and prune. Dry, wood-derived tannins appear on the finish, and, overall, the wine is more spicy and savory than it is fruity.
This 100% Chardonnay is off dry, with honey, orange, vanilla and yeast flavors. The bubbles are scoury and clean. Drink up.
This beautifully concentrated wine is all-fruit, all the time. It's appetizing texture is buoyed by firm, fine-grained tannins. It oozes blackberry syrup aromas, and floods the palate with rich grape and cassis flavors that linger a long time on the finish.
Sourced from the Conner Lee vineyard, this reflects the cool, difficult vintage, with a preponderance of herbal flavors. Cabernet Franc is given to showing an earthy, woodsy character in any event, and here it seems to rule. Highlights of baking spices, from aging 15 months in one-third new French oak, add flavor interest. With extensive breathing, the black cherry fruit comes up nicely. It should benefit from additional bottle age.
This Palmes d'Or style is used to create a wine rather than a Champagne. It works here, the structure and the toast all giving a mouthfeel of Burgundy. The acidity of course is characteristic of Champagne, but it is well integrated into the yeast, the green stone fruits and the pink grapefruit freshness.
Green-apple and honeyed aromas are more simple and anonymous than special. This varietal white Grenache has a shearing linear acidic palate that fosters tart flavors of tangerine and lemon peel. A stony drawn finish is crisp and zesty.
This wine impresses from first pop, a complicated, well-crafted exploration of full-bodied flavor and brambly beauty. Blueberry pie, violet and cigar tease the nose as they follow through on a soft, supple layering of fine-tuned texture. But it's the stony minerality and undeniable coaxing of white pepper that imprint the memory. This wine should only get better through 2034.
Crushed cloves, allspice and nutmeg are sprinkled across a ripe olallieberry base on this wine from a vineyard owned by the founder of Rabbit Ridge. It's thick and dense on the palate, perhaps too much so for some, with dried cherries, cranberries, lots of spice and even some tar elements.
Rich, sweet and ripe up front, with aromas of molasses, black fruits and spice. The palate is concentrated and full, with roasted, beefy flavors of berry, plum and spice. A sizable finish anchors the wine's weighty personality. Big and generous given the price.
. Racy and strong, and comes down firmly on the grass, hay and grapefruit side, brimming with bright, tart fruit. A touch of sugar puts it just this side of sweet, with an intriguing taste of white chocolate on the finish. Gets the nod because it's so ultra-clean and zesty. —S.H.
Simple but solid, this offers delicate aromas of rose and red berry. The straightforward palate isn't as expressive, showing dried cherry, a note of star anise and sage alongside assertive astringent tannins that leave an abrupt, mouth-drying finish.
This full-bodied white conveys delicate fragrances of chamomile, Spanish broom and stone fruit. The round palate offers creamy white peach, apricot and nectarine alongside fresh acidity. A note of candied ginger signals the close.
This is a spunky, jumpy Tempranillo with horsey aromas of cherry and plum. A light, fresh palate delivers lightly herbal flavors of plum and pie cherry, with an earthy twist. Mild and hollow on the finish.
Vibrant in apple blossom and coconut, this voluptuous, well-made wine is full bodied and ripe. Key-lime pie and orange pith marry atop a firmly structured texture and a punch of integrated oak, finishing with a taste of caramel apple.
A full, fruity, slightly hot Chardonnay. The barrel aging—all French, 60% new—brings the expected toastiness. This is a solidly made, fruit-forward style, immediately ready for drinking.
Waxy smelling, with mild baked apple aromas. Feels smooth, with a good texture and creamy flavors of peach and apple cut by just enough acidity to keep it fresh. Finishes in good form, with a round body and acidic bite.
This fragrant red opens with aromas of violet, rose, woodland berry, tilled earth and a whiff of new leather. The polished, fruity palate delivers juicy morello cherry, red raspberry, white pepper, and mineral alongside refined tannins and bright acidity. A licorice note wraps around the lingering finish. It's already tempting but will be even better in a few years. Drink 2018–2023.
The wine comes from a block within the Savoy vineyard, a source of sometimes great Pinot fruit. This wine plays it down the middle. It's good and proper in Pinot-esque qualities, with cherry and cola flavors, a silky texture and a dry, spicy finish. But it's not particularly exciting.
Hints of cedar and spice accent ripe red-fruit and flower notes on this distinctly Old World-style Pinot Noir. A fresh green-herb flavor, brisk acidity and penetrating tannins drive through the long finish.
There are odd hints of plastic in the nose and in the flavor, along with black-cherry fruit. In the mouth this wine feels disjointed, with a chalky, short finish and a hint of coconut.
This is Reininger's super Tuscan-style blend: half Sangiovese, one quarter Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Merlot and 10% Cab Franc. I applaud the innovation, and the care given to its extra aging, but confess puzzlement as to what exactly this wine is intended to be. The extra time in bottle has softened it into a pleasing, mellow condition; it would make a heck of a good spaghetti wine, but the price suggests grander aspirations.
This wine is full of all the right elements, from juicy acidity to black currant fruit and a supporting layer of tannins. It has weight, concentration and delicious spice and berry flavors. Drink from 2020.
Creamy with a smooth streak of rich butterscotch, this is a very appealing wine that seems to gather strength as it slides through the mouth. It hits a whopping 15.3% alcohol, and yet retains a silky feel and a nice mix of peach, apricot and papaya fruits. It just goes on and on, almost like a dessert wine without the sugar.
Deep gold in color, this is a finely perfumed, toffee-rich wine, with a tannic edge, wood flavor, intense acidity and great concentration. It's a great example of aged tawny, and it's ready to drink now.
Raspberry and plum aromas come with notes of tea and spice. This is fresh and fairly light in body, with a touch of creaminess. Dry, spicy, modest red-fruit flavors finish spicy and with better-than-average length. For the money, this is quite good.
Jammy, grapey and fresh, with blackberry and cherry flavors that taste right out of the fermenter. Richness comes from notes of coffee, leather and spice. So easy to imagine drinking this wine with a cheeseburger.
Barrel fermented and aged on the lees for almost a year, this is a nutty, slightly oily wine that shows the influence of the barrel, but lacks the fruit density to match it. The 14% alcohol hits the palate with some heat. High-toned and a bit harsh.
This chewy, tangy white wine is an engaging blend of 42% Viognier, 33% Marsanne, 23% Roussanne and a splash of Grenache Blanc. Fresh flavors of citrus, apples and pineapple abound. If you're looking for an unoaked alternative to Chardonnay, this is a good option.
Aromas of dried strawberry, Fig Newton, black currant and licorice are ripe and forward, with a hint of bacon adding a savory element. This is a firmly structured wine, with a slightly warm finish. A grilled steak or a hamburger would make for a good pairing.
It's taken some time for many of Marlborough's 2012 Pinot Noirs (the product of a cool season) to come around, but this is one that's worth the wait. It's evolved into something quite round and soft, with a long, silky finish. Yet it's not a fruit-forward wine by any stretch, showing more earth, soy and mushroom notes and just enough plum and black cherry fruit to carry those savory complexities. Drink now–2020.
Slightly off-dry, with short-lived but attractive notes of fresh apple and pear drop. This wine is exceptionally light but with a faint bitterness that reminds us we're in Italy. Drink now.
Seems like quality and character are slipping a bit on this Malbec, which a few years ago overdelivered but is now more average. Red licorice, strawberry and sweetness characterize the nose. The palate is sweet and generic, while the finish is pretty much the same. Perfectly good but not the gem it used to be.
This wine is a golden color that is showing some browning despite its youth. The aromas offer notes of marmalade and diesel. The flavors are concentrated and sugary sweet. It delivers plenty of enjoyment but seems advanced for its age. Enjoy it sooner than later.
Ripe fruit and chocolate rise upfront but the wine also offers background tones of old leather and spice. This 75-25 Sangiovese and Merlot blend is plush, rich and sits comfortably on the palate. Pair it with lasagna or stuffed pasta with meat sauce.
Simple but pleasant aromas of violet, plum, grape and mulberry show on the nose of this widely available and well-priced twist-top bottling. The palate pops with acidity, showing flavors of blackberry, boysenberry and tart plum skins, framed by thin though sticky tannins.
Crisp green pear and a razor-thin sharpness cut into more lush kiwi and honeysuckle notes on the nose of this bottling. A steely line of Key lime slices through the white peach flavors once sipped, and the palate cleans up with a tense, chalky grip.
Aromas of woodspice, char, pickling spices and herbs are out in front of red and black fruit. The flavors are light and appealing, but ultimately the oak provides distraction.
Ripe in cherry, raspberry, root beer, spice and vanilla oak flavors, this dry wine has a good balance of acidity. On the downside is a touch of the funky, sweaty smell that affects some of the winery's other wines.
Lots of flashy blackberry and cassis flavors in this Cabernet. Easy to drink, but feels way too soft to earn a higher score. Drink up.
With its wonderful, heady aromas of red fruits and sweet jelly, this is already a delicious wine before the first sip. Then the exuberant fruits kick in with flavors of red berries, strawberries and sweet plums. As a balance, there is firm structure, minerality and fine finishing acidity.
This wine shows ripe fruit, sweet tannins and soft acidity. Strawberries are prominent along with a bright, fruity feel. The wine doesn't seem likely to age and will be enjoyable in a year.
Spins a ton of raw berry and plum aromas along with oak, and the wine is plenty flavorful. Problem is, it's pretty bumpy and aggressive, with jagged tannins and a fiery feel. Good in some ways; rough in others. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.
This is a satisfyingly yummy Zinfandel that's chock block with raspberry and boysenberry flavor, and a tannic structure that's still in full force. There's softness in the mouthfeel and an easygoing finish that's touched with cinnamon spice and chocolate. A good wine to pair with a range of food from barbecue ribs to pizza.
This seems lighter in weight than expected, despite an impressively dark, saturated color. Lots of cherries and dried spices on the palate, along with aromas of walnuts and smoked meat. “Passing through some middle-age disturbances,” as Côrte-Real said, or just very good Port, not great? Hold.
Altano, a table-wine project of the Symington family, famous for their various Port houses (among them, Dow's, Graham's and Warre's), takes a two-pronged approach to marketing. A pricier Reserva offers greater richness and texture along with hints of oak, but while the entry-level Altano lacks the rich texture and density, it offers good value. Cherries and sappy green herb notes combine in a lightweight, easy quaffer that folds in dark chocolate and black tea notes on the finish.
Fermented in French oak using only wild yeasts, this is a lavish and spicy Chenin for a reasonable price. Wood-driven notes of honeyed almonds, toasted challah and Honeycomb cereal dominate the overall character, though flavors of pineapple and juicy peach appear in the mouth.
Right on the border of being a dessert wine, this unusual Pinot Gris has 2.8% residual sugar. It's betwixt and between—not really sweet enough for dessert, but too sweet for most other food. A simple sipping wine, perhaps?
A beauty in every respect. The nose is perfectly toasted, with attractive apple and peach nuances. The palate feel and its full-fruit flavors build into a crescendo of Champagne style. It’s clean, lusty and just the right call for a celebratory evening. Mouthfuls of total harmony don’t come often and they don’t come cheap.
From the irrepressible Randall Grahm's Languedoc label, this Syrah boasts aromas of sour berries, cedar and saddle leather that evolve on the palate into indistinct black murkiness. Narrowly constructed, with a tart, charcoally finish.
Slightly quirky but wholly acceptable aromas of animal or natural rubber make a fleeting first impression. The wine then relaxes and delivers pleasing aromas of wild berry, spice and forest floor. The jury's out on how long the wine will age, but five years is a safe bet.
This firm wine has black-currant and red-plum fruit, nicely integrated with the dry core. Ready to drink, although capable of aging a year or two.
A good wine, although not up there with the '05. But it could improve with a few years of age. Right now, it's tannic, sharp and fresh in blackberries, cherries and rich oak, with a touch of milk chocolate.
Heady yellow flower and honey aromas waft from this sunny, off-dry wine. The palate is concentrated with fresh apple flavors, but pierced with a streak of lime and lemon acidity. Finishes moderately long with a touch of lemon-zest astringency.
Stalky and light, this is a blend of Tannat, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. It has an herbaceous character that is balanced by berry fruits. It is the red berry fruitiness that dominates at the end.
Nicely dry and crisp, this fresh, lively wine has a light cookie-dough aroma, refreshing Pippin apple and lemon flavors and a tangy finish. It's a good choice to serve pre-meal or at the table.
Expensive by South American standards, but at least it's no imposter. This is high-class Chardonnay with toast, apple and quince aromas. The palate runs a little sweet, but it has the acidity, smoke and wood tannins to keep it focused. Quality from head to toe puts this in the top decile for Argentina. But is it worth $39? 280 cases made.
Wonderfully rich and decadent in botrytis and fruit, just bursting with apricot jam, orange liqueur, honey, vanilla and smoky oak flavors. Pretty sweet, but never cloys due to the refreshing acidity. Totally addictive with vanilla ice cream.
From vines in the Douro Superior, a soft, rich wine, polished with black cherry and wood. It is finely concentrated, flavored with spice, tarragon and a final solid, chunky structure.
This wine all comes Chandler Reach Vineyards. The aromas seem to lack clarity while the cranberry, prune and cherry flavors want for midpalate concentration.
An intriguing nose of lemon, pineapple, vanilla and banana candies are encased in a waft of warm yeast. Flavors of honeydew, more pineapple and oak spice are folded into a saline and nutty component. The weight is plush and feels silky on the tongue.
This 50-50 blend of Sangiovese and Merlot is one of the best red wines produced in Umbria. The Lamborghini family (of automotive fame) delivers a plush, modern—and yes, racy—red with dark concentration and generous tones of ripe cherry, vanilla and sweet spice. It has a chewy, plush feel in the mouth with bright freshness on the close.
This Lambrusco shows an extra touch of sophistication that sets it apart from most of the industrial stuff on the market. Dark berry and raspberries offer a linear and bright mouthfeel.
Aromas of cigar box, herb and cherry are followed by bright tart acid-driven cranberry flavors. The tannins bring a light astringency but it delivers a lot of enjoyment.
This new wine from the Torres group is a little heavy and baked on the nose, but once you get it onto the palate there's depth, mouthfeel and solid flavors of savory fruit, soy, rubber and dark berry. Dry on the finish, with a mounting note of coffee. Not overly fruity or sweet, which may be a blessing for some palates.
Lush and ripe, brimming with blackberry, chocolate and coffee flavors, this soft wine finishes with a distinct, cola-soda sweetness. Fortunately, crisp acidity is there for balance.
The wine is a little candied, with stewed cherry, brown sugar and cinnamon flavors, set off with good acidity. It's also a bit hot and oaky. Hard to see it aging, so drink up.
From Sierra Foothills Syrah pioneer Bill Easton comes this sensational bottling from the Pyramid Block of his Sentinel Oak Vineyard in Shenandoah Valley, the oldest selection of the grapes. Built to age 10-plus years, this wine shows integrated fruit, super amounts of tannin and structure, touches of savory rusticity and sensual texture that evolves in the glass.
So lucid it looks almost like water. The nose is light and airy, too, with flower blossom and apple aromas but not a lot more. Sharp in the mouth, with prickly green apple, lemongrass and lychee flavors. Narrow on the finish. Imported by Ecovalley Quality Wine Group and National Refrescos Import Company, LLC.
This wine captures Pinot's silky, spicy qualities, although it's thin, light and basic. Some pretty notes of raspberry, smoke, sun-dried tomato, mushroom and chocolate and a nice, spicy intensity on the palate. The tannins are soft and light, and it snaps to a quick finish.
This Zinfandel is slightly sweet. Not too much, but there's a touch of sugar to the blackberries and cherries, which makes them jammy. The other flavors range from black pepper and anise to chocolate and cedar. Drink now with rich pasta and cheese dishes.
Inky and raw, but in the best way. This is an unbridled, unchained monster of a Chianti, one with impeccable depth and extraction but also one that doesn't sit on your palate like dead weight. Racy acids and firm tannins work in tandem to prop up the bulky dark fruit, creating a structured, delicious mass. Drink from 2007 through 2015.
This is the entry-level red from this estate in the heart of the Dão region. Its red-berry fruits are bright, bursting from the glass, bringing a firmer tannic core and a mineral texture. The wine is a typical blend of the region with Touriga Nacional, Alfrocheiro and Jaen. The oak aging has given the wine a smooth ripe aftertaste. Drink from 2018.
Prima Pietra is a stand-alone super Tuscan blend from the Castiglion del Bosco estate (owned by fashion's Ferragamo family), which is already well known for its excellent Brunello di Montalcino. This is a plump, modern and well-extracted wine with soft tannins and beautiful length.
Freshly brewed coffee, green herbs, graphite and dark fruit aromas leap up from this blend of 60% Merlot and 40% Cabernet Franc. The flavors are sweet, with a soft, lush feel.
Nothing flashy here, just straightforward, tart fruit flavors leaning to apple, white peach and other cool-climate fruit.
Malbec from Marmande, between Cahors and Bordeaux, is softer and smoother than Cahors. It has the same ripe, juicy black fruits, with tannins that are already well integrated into the wine. The finish brings out spice and light acidity.
The aromatic greeting on this old-vines Cab is smooth, harmonious and elegant, with notes of plum, cassis, tobacco and fine oak. The palate is a bit high-pitched, with racy acidity, while flavors of herbs, tomato, spiced berry fruits and oak finish similar, with dry, drawing tannins. Drink through 2021.
Aromas of black-skinned berry, scorched soil and bell pepper lead the nose. The dense dark palate delivers juicy black plum, tobacco and clove framed in chewy tannins. Enjoy through 2020.
Note the "Benedict Vineyard" label, from a time when Sanford had lost control. Alcohol 13.5%. Good color, cloudy with sediment. Rich red cherry aroma, anise, sweet beet, smoky char, spice. Dry, full-bodied, rich in dark cherry fruit. Still tannic, should  develop. Now-2010.
Floral scents of iris and rose meld together with wild berry, chopped mint and a balsamic note. The elegantly structured, full-bodied palate presents juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry, white pepper and licorice alongside firm, fine-grained tannins. Drink 2018–2025.
A hugely extracted and super rich wine, this Valpolicella Superiore opens with barbecue smoke, spicy salsa, cola, licorice and freshly ground coffee bean. It's bold, rich and long-lasting on the close.
Showing lemon zest and yellow apricot flavors, this bone-dry Chard has serious underpinnings of minerals. It's reminiscent of a good French Chablis, and may require time in the cellar.
Give this stylish wine a few minutes to rev its engine and you'll be rewarded with warm pear and apple aromas. The palate is equally nice as it focuses on apple, pear and peach flavors. The finish is relatively long, clean and pretty, and overall it's a very nice wine with a hint of intricacy and complexity.
Two fistfuls of Merlot help soften this wine, along with 5% Petit Verdot. These grapes contribute to the full-bodied spirit and youthful tannin make-up that becomes plush and lush as it goes, revealing sizable elements of mocha, black currant and vanilla-tinged oak. Drink now through 2020.
There is impressive balance here—rich apple and pear flavors with a tang of minerality. It is smooth and concentrated on the one hand and edgy and nervy on the other. Screwcap.
A 50-50 blend of Sangiovese and Malvasia Nera, Maurleo shows a fresh, crisp quality with red cherry and wild berries in the foreground. Dig deeper and you'll find spice, toast and nutty tones as well.
A good everyday Merlot that's dry and softly tannic, with pleasant cherry, cola and spice flavors.
This full-bodied wine reveals aromas of wild berry and allspice accented with a balsamic note. The palate is still rather closed but delivers black cherry, black pepper, sage and licorice alongside tightly woven tannins that need to unwind. Drink 2016–2023.
This medium-bodied Pinot Noir shows tasty varietal characteristics such as complex aromas of tea, plums and forest floor, almost-sweet cherry flavors, refreshing acidity, moderate tannins and a lingering finish. It earns its points with charm rather than weight.
From a very fine Port vintage, this is ripe and fruity, and also packs a dark punch of tannins. It is on the dry side of Port, structured and compact and still obviously very young. Rich black fruits and the dense tannins promise the right sort of aging, so drink from 2022
Lightweight, with more dryness than richness, this wine is lightly sweet, hinting at botrytis, with apple and cream flavors touched by honey.
From a group of estates that has properties in the Douro, Lisboa and Beira, this wine is finely structured and richly textured. It has layers of tannins supporting its dense berry fruit. With its juicy acidity and black currant flavor, it's likely to age further. Drink from 2018.
This wine is mature, ripe and perfectly ready to drink. With hints of toast mingling with minerality and tangy acidity, it is a balanced, delicious wine full of rich flavors. The acidity has softened while keeping the tension of pure Chardonnay from the Côte des Blancs. Drink now. Gonet uses this label for the American market.
Toasty, buttery and laced with tropical fruit, this is a full-bodied, fully-oaked Chardonnay that manages to pull all that off with grace and aplomb, thanks to healthy acid levels and admirable concentration. Long on the finish; drink now through 2013.
This solidly good block selection shows shy aromas of dark red and purple fruit with a touch of earth and asphalt. The palate is tart and tight, with a bit of sagebrush nuance.
With some rubber, prune and earth, the nose is well put together. A second act of blackberry, cassis and tobacco flavors is endearing, while the dark, woodsy finish is masculine, leaving a leftover espresso character. A touch heavy and awkward, but packs power. Imported by W. J. Deutsch & Sons.
Hard, pickled aromas settle on leathery and burnt after airing. The palate is jammy and sticky, with sweet, heavy, roasted, burnt-tasting black fruit flavors. Resiny as well. Tempranillo with 10% Syrah.
This is classic Chenin Blanc, with flavors of almonds and layers of acidity. It needs some bottle age—maybe 2–3 years.
Hugely ripe Merlot is at the core of this rich wine. It is opulent, rounded and packed with dark plum-juice flavors. It verges on too much, too rich and too generous. What redeems it is the Bordeaux structure and final dry aftertaste.
Heavy and ripe, with sweet apple and pear aromas. Not terribly fresh, with canned peach flavors prior to a sweet, weighty finish. Already tiring.
Super-dark in color, this extracted wine offers a reductive note on the nose, followed by a rustic tinge of hay and brick. Intensely flavored and oaked, it finishes unexpectedly herbal and dry.
Hailing from chilly Casablanca, this Syrah shows a soupy, vegetal smelling nose that's mildly green and earthy. The palate feels pretty good and chunky, but the flavor profile runs green, with an herbal finish.
Match stick and oily white-fruit aromas come in front of a round, somewhat fat palate with warm, oily flavors of lychee, banana and spice. This falls off toward ripe banana and blandness on the finish.
The aromas pop, with notes of freshly ground white pepper, orange zest and raw meat. The savory flavors are silky and elegant in style, with the oak influence dialed way back. It shows a pleasing sense of purity and balance. Put it on the dinner table to see it shine.
Utterly without flavor, like watery alcohol with a drop of lemon juice.
Underbrush, tobacco, dark cherry, licorice and grilled herb are just some of the aromas offered by this structured wine. The palate delivers mature black cherry, black pepper, sage and licorice alongside tongue-coating tannins that need time to soften. It hails from a top vineyard site and is an impressive effort from this hot, dry vintage. Drink 2017–2024.
This is a structured and balanced wine. It has spice along with tannins that are built on ripe red-fruits. This is a full-bodied wine that is made for food. Drink now.
Red fruits drive this tangy, fruity wine that is given shape by a more mineral texture. With dusty raspberry and plum flavors, it is shot through at the end with citrus.
Hard leather, black olives and spicy stewed fruits on the nose are backed by one-dimensional black-fruit flavors. The finish offers some black licorice and burnt toast, while the overall take is that it's just too heavy and extracted.
Aromas of peach blossom, citrus and a yeasty note of fresh biscuits lead the nose on this 100% Chardonnay. The palate offers walnut husk, lemon zest and a confectionary note alongside sharp acidity.
The second wine of Château Ramage la Batisse, L'Enclos is ripe and fruity. It has a sense of structure although this is played down by the rich black currant fruits. Acidity cuts through the general richness of this medium-aging wine.
This wine is absolutely what fans of traditional Rioja should be on the lookout for. It's smooth, elegant and complex on the bouquet, the perfect introduction to a firm yet classy palate, with berry, plum, spice, tobacco and vanilla flavors. Dry, toasty and just right on the finish. Drink now–2020.
Soft and aromatic hints of orange fruit and zest play on the nose. Riper hints of juicy mirabelle also join. The palate has the same, fragrant, generous and appetizing aspect of fruit, but has an extra dimension of savoriness from yeast and a wonderfully linear body, shaped by freshness and zest. The finish is long, tangy and aromatic.
Impressive for a 2008 Tempranillo. This opens with aromas of balsam wood, spice, blackberry and plum. The feel is grippy and intense, with notes of roasted berry, black olive, leather and a mildly-salty flavor. It finishes meaty, lightly herbal and slightly salinic, with a firm feel. Drink now through 2014.
Aromas recall freshly chopped herbs such as thyme and parsley, with a very likable hint of pine tar as well. That mix of tree resin and Italian herbs comes through on the palate too, making for a flavorful and stand-out wine.
Refreshing and full of vitality, this Pinot Gris offsets zesty white grapefruit flavor with a sheen of fresh herb and floral notes. It's a dry, elegant wine, with broad appeal and a youthful vigor that should last through 2016.
Aromas suggest rose petals, lychee and graphite. They all carry over to the palate along with grapefruit, mineral and a saline—almost salty—note. Pair this with spicy Indian cuisine.
This Merlot-driven blend also includes Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Malbec, the grapes grown on upper bench blocks of the producer's estate. It's simple, offering red cherry, currant and cedar flavors, with firm, persistent tannins and a ripe, round mouthfeel.
Doesn't say so on the label, but the wine comes from Kathy Joseph's Fiddlestix Vineyard, and the wine shows the property's clarity of acidity and wealth of berry and spice flavors. It's very dry, a fun wine yet a serious one too, and certainly among the best California rosés of the vintage.
What a great color on this ripe, full-flavored wine. It opens with heaps of blackberry and green olive aromas and moderate smoky oak. In the mouth, it has good berry extract, and is most notable for its dry, elegant harmony. Finishes syrupy.
Wild, foxy and full of young, bursting berry fruit. There's nothing tamed or refined or special about this youthful Tempranillo. The flavors of plum and berries are intense, bright, grabby and modest in what they deliver. Consistent wine from year to year.
Medium-intense aromas of sun-baked meadow, spiced black fruit, narcissus and Raisinette mark the slightly funky nose. Firm tannins frame the soft, full-bodied core, with a touch of cedar surfacing on the finish.
Dark and fragrant, this wine is a baby, full of fat, precocious fruit tinged with smoke and herbs. Blackberries, plums and black cherries bounce along, buoyed by adequate acidity and chalky, dusty tannins. It's full and plush in the mouth, finishing a little fat.
This blend of Cabernet Franc and Gamay concentrates on fruit and soft acidity. It has some smokiness and rounded tannins, fresh and full of red fruits. It is ready to drink.
Dark in color, an indicator that this is a ripe style of Pinot. Smells granular and earthy, its big berry fruit aromas leading to a full-bodied palate with sweet black fruit flavors. Offers good acidity and plenty of oak.
Savory spiced apple with complex autolytic overtones of stone, oatmeal, soy and baked apple lend a rich, rounded to the nose and palate. There is real character in the classy, slender structure and the lingering taste is satisfyingly clean and long.
This is a good vintage for inexpensive Oregon Pinot, as this fresh and flavorful effort proves. Hints of toasted marshmallows and coconut adorn light strawberry fruit. Drink it chilled for optimum enjoyment.
This is a full-bodied, fully hedonistic and feral wine, integrated in oak and tannin, that show a robust density on the palate of blackberry, wild sage and earth. With its robust ripeness and concentration, it features a brightness of acidity that helps complement its power.
Named for the Sentinel Gap, a nearby landmark, this is the top wine from Milbrandt. Supple and complex, it shows a sensuous mix of fruits, ranging from mixed berries into black cherries, plums and cassis. The barrel notes of coffee and toast are carefully worked, and the tannins polished and sleek. A wine that may be savored immediately, or cellared for up to 10 years.
Starts out with gassy, earthy aromas that suggest heat and barnyard, while the palate is chunky and full, with stemmy black cherry, plum and berry flavors along with coffee and chocolate accents. Delivers power and length but not much in the way of character or complexity.
A strong, bold young wine, with good varietal flavors of blackberries and black currants. It's hard in tannins now, and the oak hasn't been integrated even though the wine is nearing the five year mark. Somehow, it doesn't seem like a longterm ager, but it will benefit from a couple years in the bottle.
Fresh and citrus crisp, this is a Sauvignon-dominated herbaceous wine. It has a light structure and a texture that brings out vivid lemon zest. Not for aging, drink now.
A heavy and dark version of the variety, this bottling delivers tension and bite from its intense oak. Ripe black cherry and darker blackberry and plum mark the fruit components, laced in a leathery taste of tobacco and tomato leaf.
This wine is light and smooth. It has a crisp edge and hints of red berries, although the fruit seems dilute. Drink now.
Savory and full-bodied, this blend of 80% Sangiovese and 20% Canaiolo, Mammolo, Colorino and Barbera offers aromas of ripe dark berry, tobacco, ground pepper and truffle. The firmly structured palate delivers black cherry, black raspberry, mocha and licorice alongside velvety tannins.
This is an extraordinary, golden dessert wine with intense and penetrating notes of honey, marron glacé, dried apricot, marzipan, candied lemon, dried mint and jasmine. It's smooth, rich and long lasting in the mouth. The wine has personality and power and boasts magnetic appeal across the board.
Here's a brawny, bold expression of Sangiovese that opens with dark concentration and rich tones of black cherry, blackberry pie and cinnamon crust. It feels soft, sweet and succulent on the close.
Leather, berry, earth, raisin and roasted qualities define the nose on this Tempranillo-led blend of four grapes. Feels good in the mouth, with active raspberry, plum and coffee flavors that comes with a roasted accent. Mildly leafy, baked and woody on the thorough finish.
To celebrate the family's 150th anniversary (founded in 1864), the Milans have released two Champagnes, half fermented in wood the other half in tank. The result for this Blanc de Blancs is a full wine, with a future that will bring out richness as well as a tight, mineral structure with just a hint of toast.
Rather rustic, with berry and earth flavors inside some pretty edgy tannins. Finishes dry and astringent, with a touch of cherry.
This is a big, bold, fruity wine, typical of the powerful reds of Alentejano. It has ripe tannins, concentrated dark fruits and juicy final acidity. With a blend that includes Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, it's made to age, and this full-bodied wine should be kept until 2016.
Plenty of good plum and raspberry flavors give substance to this very smooth-textured and medium-bodied wine. It has a mouth-filling quality, ripe fruit and light touches of spice to keep it interesting.
This is a varietally pure and evocative medium-bodied Gewürztraminer. Ginger, white pepper and floral, leafy, spicy notes entwine around a core of melon and pear, then finish bright, dry and peppery.
Juicy succulent tangerine and yellow peach flavors meld on the palate of this forward fruity off-dry wine. On first taste, it's quite straightforward, but added attention reveals glimmers of spice, saffron and mineral complexities. Drink now through 2024.
This is just this side of unctuous, a decadently ripe and rich late harvest Riesling. The residual sugar is at 23%, the alcohol a moderate 8%, and the balance impeccable, with a buoyant underpinning to the intense sweetness. It avoids sugary granularity as well, offering seamless, concentrated fruit that piles on flavors of peach, apricot, banana, mango, papaya and melon in wild profusion, trailing into sweet tea and honey. Apart from the winery's Single Berry Select Trockenbeerenauslese project with Ernie Loosen, this is the best dessert wine made in Washington.
Green apple and lemon zest make for a pungent touch of volatility that tickles the nose as you sniff this ruby-colored Amarone. The intensity and clarity is great, and the finish concedes more room to spice, dark fruit and almond flavors.
Mandarin peel flirts with the aromatic zest of Seville orange. The concentration of flavor is immense and has the verve, drive and linearity of a jet-engine on on takeoff. The palate slows down the motion and captures the nuanced flavors of Seville orange—tinged green, bitter, juicy and tart at the same time. This will not reach its finish line for years but will provide racy enjoyment all the way. Drink 2018–2030.
Peachy aromas are less than perky, while in the mouth this is lemony, narrow and citric. Flavors of lemon and tangerine finish with stony mineral notes but also a drawing citric acidity.
Granny Smith apple and clementine flavors are the backbone of this wine, with additional accents of white florals and green plum skin. Medium weight with aggressive but enjoyable acidity and a zippy finish.
Beautifully perfumed, this has ripe blackberry flavors and a relatively dry character. The spirit is now well balanced, giving a backbone to the violet aromas and spicy character of this still-young LBV. It is good to drink now for its fruit, but it will improve and show more complex flavors after 2017–2018.
Light golden-colored, this blend of 75% Roussanne, 12% Grenache Blanc and 13% Marsanne comes from Boushey and Olsen vineyards. It draws you into the glass with aromas of marzipan, nectarine and spice. The stone fruit flavors are lightly creamy in feel, showing a pleasing sense of balance and a lengthy finish.
This opens with aromas of ripe black-skinned berry, underbrush and leather. The bold concentrated palate offers black cherry, raspberry jam, clove and a hint of licorice. Firm fine-grained tannins provide the framework. Drink 2018–2025.
90-92 Barrel sample. This is effectively no longer the second wine of Ducru-Beaucaillou, since it comes from its own vineyards. It is a dense, sculpted wine, formed around a core of chewy tannins. Currently impenetrable and black.
This Cabernet comes in three different labels, displaying the archetypes of the explorer, the business man and the adventurer. In taste, the wine is smoky and soft, with plum, cassis and dark cherry all making a play.
A méthode Champenoise blend of 92% Pinot Noir and 8% Chardonnay, this dry, crisp sparkler shows a finesse of texture wrapped in green apple, preserved lemon and vanilla. It's light and bright.
This tan-colored bubbly from stony soils smells complex, bready, yeasty and a lot like baked apple. A round, yeasty palate is cushioned like fine bedding, while yeasty flavors of bread and apple finish long. Drink through 2020.
Radiant and structured, this is initially closed but slowly opens to reveal engaging aromas of woodland berry, violet, star anise, dark cooking spice and a balsamic note. The vibrant, full-bodied palate boasts great energy while offering layers of wild cherry, raspberry, white pepper and licorice. Bright acidity and firm, polished tannins provide balance. Give it time to fully develop. Drink between 2020 and 2035.
On the dry side, the red cherry flavor is concentrated inside acidity and a fruit skin texture. Very fresh, very crisp, for food.
This is a light, leafy wine, with tannins that taste of green tea and leave a sensation of astringency long after the wine is swallowed. Sounds like Burgundy! In a world where so many Oregon wineries are making Pinot Noir that is superripe, extracted and alcoholic, this shows why the Burgundy comparison is still valid.
A superbly balanced wine that boasts a seamless intensity of apple fruits, soft citrus and beautiful acidity. It has its rich moments, with a hint of pineapple, easily absorbed into the great elegance.
Both ripe red apple and crisp green Granny Smith play on the nose, however, they are laced with both honey and zesty citrus, creating thrill. This is wonderfully poised and invigorating. Totally streamlined and linear, it's a wine to enjoy now and for years to come.
This bone-dry blush has flavors of pepper, herb tea and baked cherry pie filling, and finishes very dry. It tastes a little tired, despite its young age.
Mild peach skin and apricot aromas precede fresh and vivid white peach flavors in this dry, refreshing wine. It's well balanced, has enough concentration to keep it interesting and will be very versatile with food.
Herbaceous aromas of hay and tomato leaf meld together with notes of stone fruit, citrus and flint. The round, medium-bodied palate offers white grapefruit, candied nectarine zest, white peach, aromatic herb and mineral. Fresh acidity brightens the rich flavors.
Toh! boasts a luminous golden color but is measured on the nose despite its intense appearance. This wine plays most of its cards in the mouth, where it delivers thick, creamy structure and a chewy, almost succulent finish. Don't drink this wine too cold.
Quite nondescript, with spicy chili aromas and other hard-to-peg piquant smells. The palate is sweet, awkward and deals cinnamon and clove along with weak berry fruit. It's almost there, but throughout it lacks a certain something.
This Pinot Noir and Chardonnay blend is a little rough in the mouth, with scoury bubbles. It's rich and ripe in raspberries, strawberries and limes, with a yeasty edge and plenty of acidity. Ready to drink now.
This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (72%), Malbec (15%) and Petit Verdot (13%) still seems very youthful and fresh. The cassis fruit is relatively simple and primary, accented only by hints of vanilla and mint until the finish, when some coffee notes creep in. It's full bodied and heavily extracted, yet the tannins remain velvety from start to finish.
Aromas of ripe plum, dark berry, violet, baking spice, leather and tilled earth all come together in the glass. The juicy, structured palate doles out crushed black cherry, anise, ground pepper, tobacco and a hint of chopped herb. It boasts a great depth of flavors and fruit purity, while firm, velvety tannins give it an almost creamy mouthfeel. Drink 2018–2027.
Cortinie Bianco (a blend of 50% Chardonnay, plus Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon and Gewürztraminer) offers fragrant yellow rose, Golden Delicious apple and fragrant stone fruit. The wine is especially successful on the palate where is shows a creamy, rich texture.
Made from the exotic Scheurebe grape, this is a very sweet wine, brimming with pineapple jam, ripe pear and honeysuckle flavors, with an oily, glyceriney fatness. It's balanced with crisp acidity, so the finish is dry and clean. Just delicious now with fruity desserts, vanilla cake or a buttery lemon soufflé.
This is by far the most expensive of Duckhorn's new releases, but it's not the best to drink now. Based on Cabernet Sauvignon, it's easy to imagine the winemaker singling out the most tannic and concentrated lots, but what you get is, simply, a very tannic wine. There's a gigantic core of blackberry and black currant fruit, but it's hard to appreciate because of the astringency. The suggestion is longterm aging, but there can be no guarantees.
Ruben “The Grape Whisperer” Solorzano leaves the vineyard to try his hand in the cellar, and the results are magical. Deep rose and fresh lilac aromas make for an extreme florality, followed by blackberry and black-plum scents. Purple flowers also show on the palate, where a nice sizzle of acidity unleashes candied grape flavors and a spicy pepper element.
Leather and dust, with thin raspberry fruit that is pretty well buried under the barnyard flavors.
The wine is soft, just juicy and with little in the way of concentration. Barrel-aged for 12 months in one-third new oak, it is attractive and ready to drink now. Vines are planted on limestone and clay above limestone and iron schist subsoil.
Delicate aromas suggesting chamomile flower and acacia honey carry over to the linear but somewhat lean palate along with hints of citrus and yellow apple. Racy acidity provides the backbone while a bitter almond note marks the finish.
Elegant and nuanced, this penetrating Cabernet Franc offers bold strokes of blackberry and plum tinged with hints of wet soil, crushed mineral and spice. It's bold and lusciously composed but there's a puckery-fresh brightness of acidity that's delightful. Released with extended cellar aging, its soft, feathery tannins are approachable already but it's still structured enough to improve well through 2025.
Shows the clear, fine color, silky mouthfeel and crisp acidity that characterize a fine, cool-climate Pinot Noir, but I wish the fruit were a little more concentrated. It's fine in cola, red cherry, pomegranate and rhubarb, but the middle is thin and the finish is quick. Drink now.
It's easy to see why Silver Oak remains so popular with the restaurant crowd. It's made in a more restrained style than many other Napa Cabs. There's plenty of berry and currant fruit as well as oak, but it's accompanied by tobacco and herbs that give the wine an earthiness. What the wine lacks in dazzle it more than makes up for in elegance and subtlety. Should develop well for at least a decade.
Red plums and black cherries dominate this ripe, fruity wine, which brings in plenty of fresh acidity to balance the dry underlying tannins. The Oberer Wald vineyard, on the eastern shores of the Neusiedlersee, gives uncomplicated wines that are great partners with hearty food.
Bone dry, with brisk tannins, this is a Merlot to drink with good food and not worry about the wine overshadowing it. It's really drinkable, with a soft, lush mouthfeel and flavors of cherries, currants, spices and cedar. A huge and welcome improvement over the '06.
A traditional blend of Trebbiano (60%) and Malvasia, this amber-colored vin santo offers smokey, resin-like aromas beyond candied fruit, caramel and butterscotch. It's thick and powerful with a blast of syrupy sweetness on the close.
Chardonnay in Rutherford? Yes, and a very good one. It has polished peach and apple flavors as well as a sweet, rich coat of oak, and is balanced, crisp and dry.
Tastes unevenly ripened, with some wintergreen flavors side by side with raisins, although the middle is rich in cherries. On the plus side is silkiness and dryness. Drink now.
Quite full-bodied and rich in cassis and black currant fruit, this Cabernet feels weighty in the mouth. Partly that's due to the ripe fruit, and partly to the oak. It has an astringent scour of tannins, suggesting at least a few years of ageability.
Quintessential Paso Cab blend, rich, dry and soft. You'll find cherry and coffee flavors, with an herbal edge, wrapped in gentle but richly textured tannins and low acidity.
Dominated by Pinot Meunier, this is a soft and ripe wine despite its low dosage. It is aromatic with summer flowers and quince fruit flavors, while the aftertaste brings out a drier character. Vincelles village, home of the producer, is right at the western limit of Champagne production
Apple flavors dominate this attractive blend of seven grapes, including three aromatic varieties, that give the wine its perfumed character. So although it is young and with enough acidity, it is the hints of lychee and peppered pear that add interest to the wine. Drink now.
This is a rather weighty Pinot Noir, still filled with the exuberant fruit of youth—all plums and black cherries, framed with hints of vanilla and spice. Despite the heft, the tannins are soft, making this wine immediately accessible. Drink now–2015.
Aromas of black cherry, brambly berry, violet and oregano give way to sophisticated flavors of dark fruit, spice and leather. This nicely balanced Syrah offers harmonious tannins, with just a touch of grippiness, leading to a smooth, somewhat savory finish.
Smells different than most, with blueberry, carob and exotic sandalwood. Takes a dive on the palate, where it's sweet, syrupy and flat, almost like prune juice. Along those lines, it tastes pruny, with chocolate on the finish. Struggles to achieve balance.
This single-vineyard Malbec may come from a young vineyard (planted in 2000), but it's still dark, concentrated and masculine. Purple in color, with thick, grapey aromas that lead to lush blackberry, cola and chocolate flavors. Rich, deep and well developed for Chilean Malbec.
Very extracted and ripe, this wine's voluptuous cherry, currant, licorice and spice flavors are compromised by excessive softness. Doesn't show much complexity beyond the fruit, so drink now.
A wonderful Sauvignon Blanc, bone dry and tartly crisp, with mouthwatering flavors of lemons, limes, grapefruits, minerals, vanilla and peppery spices. Entirely unoaked, it's a fine cocktail sipper, and great with savory little appetizers.
Lots of exotic citrus, peach and tropical fruit flavors in this crisply clean blend, but it's really too sweet to qualify as a dry table wine. Tastes more like something you'd have for dessert.
The charged scent of candied peach promises pleasure that the dry but deeply peachy palate keeps. The wine also conveys the pleasant bitterness of orange peel and refreshing crispness.
Some ageable Cabs are lovely to drink on release. Not this one. It's tough in tannins, with a gum-stinging astringency. Below all that are ripe, concentrated blackberry jam and cassis flavors. Blended with Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, it's already throwing some sediment, a good sign, which means you won't have to wait 20 years for it to come around. Pop that cork after 2018.
Bright and crisp with an edge of tannins and plenty of red-currant fruitiness, this is an attractive wine. It is perfumed with a mineral edge and lively acidity. Drink now.
This is a fuller and creamier rendition of Pinot Grigio with pretty aromas of honey, peach blossom and melon that give the wine a fragrant aromatic lift. It leaves a lean but smooth impression in the mouth and ends with bright citrus flavors. Imported by MW Imports.
A north-facing vineyard gives grapes extended hang time and moderates the high Wahluke heat. It's 100% Syrah, 30% whole cluster fermented in 20% new French oak. Good, juicy, with very tart, snappy cranberry/raspberry flavors. Lovely nuances of wet earth, black tea and soy. A substantial, ageworthy effort.
Created by Vigouroux as a hommage to Malbec in Cahors and Argentina, this has the structure of Cahors and the rich smoothness of Mendoza. Complex, powerful, full of ripe fruit, it's impressively juicy, textured and full of acidity at the end.
Not quite as concentrated as the winery's single-vineyard bottlings, but nearly so, and showing the signature dryness, acidity and overall classy mouthfeel. Beautiful and complex, with raspberry, cherry, pomegranate, rhubarb, rose petal and cola flavors that arevarietally correct. Drink now–2014.
There is a glorious touch of ripe peach among the abundant lemon notes of the nose. A hint of grapefruit spice lends added allure. These notes carry to the palate that is juicy in ripe peach, grapefruit and bright lemon. All this happens on an completely dry, finely delineated body of absolute precision and poise. There is something crystalline about this, something fine-boned and delicate that nonetheless has absolute power to convince. This is simply wonderful. Its inherent grace will only increase with time. Drink 2020–2037.
This is a ripe and spicy wine that is full of almond and tropical fruit flavors. It has a sense of richness and texture, along with a kick of pepper. The acidity is a touch light here, but there's just enough to keep it fresh.
Smells a bit oily and heavy, with sweet tropical fruit aromas leading the charge. The palate is creamy and oily feeling, with honey, nutmeg, banana and melon flavors. Fleshy on the finish; best if taken well chilled.
Engaging aromas of wild berry, new leather, tilled earth and clove slowly take shape in the glass. On the savory medium-bodied palate, bracing but noble tannins underscore a black-cherry core while notes of black olive, anise, Mediterranean herb and earthy game provide the backdrop. It's loaded with personality. Drink 2018–2028.
Huge, big, thick, gooey and high in alcohol, this only-in-California wine will turn on Zin lovers. It explodes with chocolate, blackberry, vanilla fudge and cappuccino flavors, with a suggestion of currants in the soft, honeyed finish.
This is a ripe and plump Brunello that could use two or three years of cellar aging to allow the oak notes to fully integrate. The quality of the fruit is excellent—cherry, blackberry and currants abound. Immediately behind those aromas, however, is loads of spice, smoke and tar. Drink after 2012.
Floral, tropical-fruit aromas suggest orange and mango. This is juicy and under control on the palate, with dry yeasty white-fruit and citrus flavors. On the finish, this is showing ample freshness. Drink now.
This opens with a pretty bouquet of yellow spring flowers and tropical fruit. The palate offers lingering pineapple, lemon zest and pear flavors that finish clean and refreshing. Pair this with light pastas or lightly seasoned seafood dishes.
Rubbery, herbal aromas of stalky black fruits are typical of the variety but also gritty and horsey smelling. This has a snappy, grating mouthfeel and flavors of herbal blackberry and plum along with an acid-driven palate. Licorice, oak and vanilla flavors are present on the finish.
A supple, easygoing Pinot Noir, with modest weight in the mouth but assertive notes of cola, earth and cherries. The aromas are slightly perfumed and confected, but the flavors are sturdier and more savory in nature. Drink now.
A ripe, dense, very serious wine, with a powerful element from the wood aging, dark red fruits and dense tannins. There are black figs, dry blueberry juice flavors and a shot of acidity. It's going to develop, certainly over the next 5 years.
An herbal, very crisp wine, it is unoaked and very bright. It's fresh, fruity, light in color and with citrus fruits running right through. Drink now.
This Paso red wine is soft and gentle, with bright red cherry, red licorice, sassafras, oak and spice flavors. There's a bit of sharpness in the finish.
At 1500 feet, this vineyard is the highest in the Wachau. The wine has elegance as well as richness, an impressive combination of white pear spice, citrus acidity and a final burst of mango. Definitely for aging. Imported by Vin Divino
This is very much in the house style of this producer in this vintage. It is a ripe wine, orientated towards yellow fruits with a hint of mango. The acidity is there to balance what is a rich wine, keeping the structure and shape. Drink this wine from 2018.
Rustic and country-style, with rough-edged, astringent tannins and a raisiny edge, this Cab has blackberry and cherry flavors. Fortunately, it finishes bone dry. Could develop a little more polish in a year or two.

Primary notes of green pear dominate the nose. The palate is tight with grapefruit zestiness, while some ripe yellow pear in the background provides measure and balance.
Apples and pears in the aroma lead to easygoing fruit flavors and a soft broad texture in this medium-bodied fruit-forward wine. Hints of butter and vanilla sneak in on the finish.
The mineral expression has the upper hand in this dry, full-bodied white, with tones of apple and nuts playing second fiddle to cinnamon and wet stone flavors. The long finish winds up on a nutmeg note. Drink now.
Made in the Mazzocco style of extremely high alcohol and Porty-sweet flavors of blackberries, raisins, chocolate and pepper. If you like this kind of high-octane Zin, it's for you.
Intensely floral, with toasted almond, green apple and peach notes backed by talc powder and mineral. Smooth and refreshing on the palate, with good persistence. Imported by Domaine Select Wine Estates.
This new brand is sourced from various vineyards throughout the valley. It's very ripe and interesting, offering the rich flavors and balance of the vintage. Gentle now in blackberries, black currants, anise and sweet cedar wood, and should develop over the next 5–6 years.

Black cherry aromas are followed by rich black fruit, plum and damson flavors in this wine. There is plenty of juicy acidity here as well, with tannins to support the richness. Drink from 2020.

Here's an easy sparkling blend of Pinot Nero and Pinot from Lombardy's Oltrepò Pavese area in northern Italy that shows cheerful but informal aromas of cut grass, field flower, honey and stone fruit.
This bottling, an extended lees Chardonnay, has been an innovation by the winery. The experiment is augmented by holding the release date back longer than usual. The 2006 vintage was not a great success, but this is an interesting, complex wine that should further develop in the bottle. Marked by the creamy, slightly sour taste of the lees, it has richness added by ripe apple and pineapple fruit and sweet, smoky oak.
This densely textured wine is packed with dark tannins and concentrated fruit. With its firm structure, weighty black fruit flavors and intense acidity on the finish, it will age well. Drink from 2017.
Creamy, nutty hints of oak frame fresh pear on nose and palate. The creamy texture cushions the freshness of the wine which has a pleasant weight. Together this makes for an unusual but convincing wine. Lovely now but this has the mileage to last three to five years.
Light resin and hay aromas on the nose; coats the insides of the mouth with olive oil, river rock and lemon flavors. Understated, with a piquant citrusy bite on the finish. Imported by Davies & Co.
Bright berry notes of black cherry and raspberry are followed by cinnamon, clove and dried ginger. It feels smooth, silky and offers softly textured tannins.
This Sémillon-Sauvignon Blanc blend is firm, powerful and polished. The fruit runs the gamut from citrus to melon to white peach, finishing with some youthful bite. Already a succulent, mouthfilling gem, but should improve for another five years.
Aromas of rose, violet, sour cherry and baking spice make a promising initial impression but the palate is on the lean side offering raw red berry, clove, sage and a hint of tobacco. Grainy tannins leave an astringent finish. Let the tannins soften up for another few years and then drink to capture the remaining fruit.
A genuine and upfront wine with banana, citrus, peach and attractive notes of crushed stone that are almost brackish. Simple, polished and a good bet when you want a reliable white. Imported by Prestige Wine Imports Corp.
Sea spray and salty mineral complexities accent luscious, peachy fruit from nose to finish in this delightfully complex Riesling. It's weightier and more expansive on the palate than a typical Kabinett, but spine-tingling tangerine and lemon acidity lend a fresh, persistent finish. Ready to drink now but should improve through at least 2021.
Three native grapes – Inzolia, Catarratto and Grillo – create the blend and show the potential of warm climate, Sicilian whites. This is a surprisingly fresh and crisp wine – reminiscent of cooler climates – with pungent aromas of kiwi, honeydew melon and cut grass.
Tightly closed, still young, this has wonderful promise for the future. It offers a fine tannin structure around which iron-oxide-tinged blueberry and cherry play, along with earthiness and savory spice. This needs time to loosen its tightly coiled flavors. Drink as of 2016.
Fruity, soft and rather sweet, this wine smells and tastes like apple and pear juice. It has low acidity, medium body and a sugary finish.
Vigna di Pallino is a light, well-priced and easygoing Chianti that would work with pizza or even a soup and sandwich lunch. Cherry and raspberry are wrapped around a light, compact mouthfeel.
Adelaida's Roussanne-Grenache blend can vary from vintage to vintage, but the cool 2011 has resulted in a successful bottling. The wine is full-bodied and dry, with rich flavors of fruits and berries. The oak is upfront, but fully in balance, giving the wine a touch of butterscotch.
This medium-bodied red displays an array of dried spices alongside ample black-cherry fruit. It's fresher and firmer than the 2007 (also reviewed this month), featuring some slightly dusty tannins on the finish. Drink now–2015 or so.
Shows green fruit and slightly herbal nuances on the nose, then delivers crystalline structure and purity of lime fruit and liquid minerals in the mouth. Although only light to medium in body, this is a powerhouse, with a long finish.
Leather and meat mark the entry of this brooding, brambly wine, offering shocks of black pepper on the lightly textured palate. Soft and sleek on the finish, it's benefitted from time in bottle and is ready to enjoy now.
Herbal cranberry-like aromas and flavors and moderate acidity and tannins make this wine leaner and drier than many red blends. It's built like a traditional table wine and will go well with a variety of different foods.
A massively fruity Zinfandel that shows how easy it is for the variety to ripen to perfection in Dry Creek Valley. Raspberries, cherries and currants flood the mouth, with notes of olive tapenade, cola, sandalwood and scads of dusty Indian spices, leading to a dry finish. It's a lusty wine to drink now.
Tastes both ripe and unripe at the same time, with the prime feature being a tart acidity that makes the palate burn. The flavors are of raisins and mint, and the finish is dry.
This wine bursts with the scents and flavors of fresh strawberries. It's soft and fruity but finishes dry, with flavors gently turning from berry to cherry candy.
A barely ripe blend of Pinot Gris, Pinot Blanc, Riesling and Gewürztraminer, this has strong scents and flavors that combine in a rather strange way. Perfume, breath mint and tanned leather elements pile on, without really melding or enhancing one another. Whatever it is, it's not dull.
The Clare Valley is an underappreciated source of fine Cabernet Sauvignon, and this is one of the region's standard bearers. Minty notes add a dose of Australia to this slightly austere wine, which also boasts dark chocolate, cassis and tobacco. Drink 2015–2025.
Dry and minty, this Pinot has the elegantly silky structure of a fine cool-climate wine. But it's a little thin in the cherry fruit flavors that lift it above the ordinary, and finishes quick.
Inman has not offered much Chardonnay before, but this one is highly distinctive, light as a feather, floral, crisp and citrusy, basking in Chablis-like, wet stone minerality. Those looking for butter and oak should travel elsewhere; at a preposterously unheard of 11.6% alcohol, this wine offers silky, subtle intrigue.
An easy to drink Pinot for its dryness, exceptionally low alcohol, and cleansing acidity. It has cherry, red plum, cola and herb flavors, framed with sweet, smoky sandalwood. Decant for a while.
Rich and full in the mouth, it packs in wood and ripe yellow fruits. It has weight and a great sense of balance and ripeness that contrast with acidity and a tangy, zesty texture. Drink from 2016.
Nice and ripe, with black cherry and vanilla flavors and a mouth-warming feel that's partly the result of the body, partly due to soft tannins and acids. Brings to mind those luscious, likeable wines of Chinon.
Full-bodied and slightly viscous, this has the ample weight of Viognier on display, but lacks the variety's signature floral-spicy perfume. Instead there's melon and tangerine in a likeable if slightly neutral wine.
A challenging wine, one whose future is hard to predict. The immediate impact is very rich and ripe, with flavors of milk chocolate, blackberry jam and caramelized oak. In the mouth it feels soft and yielding. Not entirely satisfactory now, so the score reflects potential beyond 2012.
Here's a lively rosso made from Prugnolo Gentile, Canaiolo and Merlot that offers an alluring violet and strawberry fragrance. Simple but well made, the palate delivers bright cherry and cinnamon spice, with freshness and a clean finish. Made to be drunk young.
Very young, juicy, loaded with boysenberry and black cherry fruit. There is a strong streak of licorice, hints of tobacco and vanilla, but plenty of muscle and stiff tannins. A substantial effort, this ranks at the top of the list of Washington Cabernet Sauvignon priced under $10.
Sourced equally from Ciel du Cheval and Ranch at the End of the Road vineyards on Red Mountain, this offers bright, fresh berry-laden fruit flavors, leading into a black cherry core enhanced with pretty spices and a whiff of chocolate. The tannins are proportionate but relatively light for this appellation.
A straightforward Cabernet, with tastes of brick, tar, tobacco and cranberry, this is a blend of Napa, Sonoma, Mendocino and Lake County fruit.
Dry and grassy, with high acidity that makes the palate clean and zesty. The lemon, lime, grapefruit and floral flavors finish with a scour of peppery spice.

This big, burly effort is structured and solidly textured. It has weight accompanying the blackberry flavor, with a firm character that demands aging over at least 18 months. The finish is still firm and concentrated.
Sharp and tight on the nose, and then it stays narrow and rather punishing on the palate. It's a tangy, gritty, tough wine with tart red-fruit flavors and bitter coffee note on the finish. Malbec-Syrah-Tempranillo is the blend.
This pure expression of Nerello Mascalese opens with bright berry intensity and drying mineral nuances of brimstone and lead pencil. The mouthfeel is fresh, lean and etched.
A superb wine, showing real Oakville character. It's bone dry, rich and complex in tannin structure, with wonderfully ripe blackberry and cassis flavors. Yet there's a minerality that anchors the wine, and the finish is long, smooth and spicy. Just delicious now, and should hold over the next six years.
Starts out with pleasant notes of supple fruit, but there's too much oak showing at the moment, and the fruit quickly gets buried. Some bitter tannins conclude; give this one extra airtime to soften it up.
Still young, but promising good things, this is a ripe and balanced wine. It's a blend of grapes from two Douro vineyards (Duas Quintas), giving black fruits, a strong sense of minerality and a dark texture. The end promises aging and drinkability from 2016.
The wood aging shows in this wine, giving a smoky, spicy character. It has softened the crisp fruits and allowed the wine to broaden out with ripe berry fruits. Solid and dense, it will need to age so drink from 2017.
Dominated by Chardonnay from the Côte des Blancs, this mature, mineral-textured wine is both ripe and beautifully structured. With white fruits and a floral character, it is moving into spicy territory. Roast almonds are balanced with a crisp character from the low dosage. The wine is now just ready to drink.
A true wine from southwest France, this brings together grapes from Gascony and Gaillac. It is delicate and fruity. The freshest green-fruit flavors come together with intense acidity and a tang that is poised and crisp.
The top wine in the Sanglière range is delicious. With its finely balanced fruit and acidity, it is bright with orange and red-currant crispness as well as a warmer sunny character. With its final acidity it is a great food wine. Drink now.
If you love tangy, spicy Sauvignon, you'll love this wine from the mountainous north of Italy. Green pepper, curry leaf, exotic fruit and lime open the bouquet. The mouthfeel is characterized by soft roundness and good intensity.
This individual and exotic wine boasts aromas of sweet bay leaves, dried apricots and crushed black pepper. The fruit flavors are tart, veering toward red cherries and apple skin, finishing with firm acids and tannins. Drink young with herbed roasts to help bring out the fruit. —J.C.

A darker take on the grape for the estate, this bottling shows black tea, violet, dark cherry, bay and a touch of tar on the nose. Deep boysenberry fruit pops on the palate, lifted by brighter notes of dill, eucalyptus and menthol.
Aromas of forest floor and herbal berry fruits set up a wide grabby palate that's neither heavy nor overdone. Inky oaky berry flavors are limited in scope and complexity, while this finishes strong, with latent spice notes.
Spearmint, bramble and tomato aromas give this wine a mature bouquet. The palate is wide and shows standard leather, berry and tobacco flavors. But it's also a bit tannic, with chocolate, coffee and a grabby feel working the finish. Pleasant and good as a whole, but by no means an overachiever.
Most of what this wine has to offer comes through its enchanting aromas of mint, cranberry, and toasty spice. The palate—light, delicate, and tart—can't quite deliver on this promise. Still, a varietally correct Oregon Pinot Noir at this price? Yes, please!
Ripe and plump blackberries shine through in a showcase of fruit purity, lifted by dried fennel, hot black gravel, peppercorns, toasted sesame and soy. There is tremendous structure and acidity on the sip, with black pepper and black-sesame nuance plus juicy boysenberry character to the midpalate.
Fully mature, this mouthfilling, supple Shiraz shows off Clare's savory side, beginning with beefy notes of bouillon and soy, then adding leather coffee and black olive to the mix. The long finish gracefully blends sweet and savory, then adds a dusting of fine tannins to keep everything in place. Drink now–2015.
This wine comes from one of the coolest Premier Cru vineyards, giving it an initial austerity that then fills out as the wine breathes. It's crisp and bright with white fruit and intense, lemony acidity. Age it for a few more months and drink from 2018.
This wine has light citrus aromas and flavors of grapefruit, tangerine and yellow peach. Pleasant fruit sweetness marks the finish.
Very dark in color, dense and thick in the mouth, and tight in astringent tannins. Clearly an immature wine not showing well. The blackberry and cherry flavors are impressive, but the wine seems disjointed. Cellaring is a gamble.
A graceful Pinot Noir that feels silky on the palate, tastes almost sweet, exudes strawberry and cherry flavors. It is smooth and pure, has a refined texture, almost delicate but with good vibrant acidity and great balance. Just a bit lighter and more elegant than The Charm bottling from Shane.
This is a simple, streamlined red wine that opens with bright aromas of cherry, blackberry and light shadings of dark spice. It has a crisp, easy-going mouthfeel that would pair with appetizers or pizza.
Welcome to the movies, and enjoy your buttered popcorn! Or in this case, enjoy your Aconcagua Chardonnay, which has been doused in a ton of buttery oak but still manages to retain kick courtesy of solid core acidity. Under all the oak look for sweet melon and pear flavors, and then a hint of peanut brittle.
This young, oaky Tinto Fino opens with charred aromas, but soon scents transition to cheesy and chocolaty. This wine is bullish in texture, with a ton of oak-driven clove, spice and burnt flavors. For the most part, fruit is not a big factor, as the “roble” in this wine drives the car.
This wine starts with rough aromas of black fruit and horseradish before turning earthy and leathery. The mouthfeel is mostly good, with rubbery tannins, and the palate bears flavors of baked red berry and herb. This is not run of the mill; it's unusual, fruity, hot and wild.
A blend of four of the major Bordeaux varieties, this wine is soft and rustic. It has dry, earthy cherry, currant and tobacco flavors that taste a little sweet and sour.
Scents of blossom and fresh apple in this off-dry Riesling suggest an orchard in early summer. Equally fresh and summery, the palate boasts bright apple and lemon flavors. Straightforward yet refreshing, it's a pretty quaffer finishing on a delicate bramble note.
Very solid—it is hard and a bit chunky—this is dark, sensuous Syrah. Streaks of black tar, smoke and tannin take it to the dark side of the grape, moving into an earthy, smoky finish.
Vintner Marco Caprai is the man who has tamed the tannic, unruly beast that is Sagrantino. Having carefully aged for two years in oak, this has become deeply elegant and sophisticated. Aromas of chocolate, exotic spice, dark berry, leather, tobacco and dried prune leave a lasting impression. Age for 10 years or more.
This is serious Blaufränkisch, a ripe, firmly structured wine that shows a dry edge of solid tannins before you get to the ripe, red fruits. There's power here, but it is finely integrated, and its fruity finish is well structured. Screwcap.
Old wood dominates this hard wine. It is tough and likely to remain that way.
A blend of Merlot and Duras, the red grape of Gaillac. The combination creates a meaty and chewy wine, with pepper and red-currant flavors. While the Merlot supplies the warmth, the Duras offers acidity and fruitiness. Drink now.
Bold and pruney, with herbal, soft, ultraripe aromas in front of a jumpy yet partially stewed palate. This blend of Malbec with Bonarda and Syrah is your typical huge, tannic bruiser with big extract, huge tannins and just enough acidity to keep it pumping. Pretty good and perfectly drinkable, but a little over the edge.
Rounded, but light, this has delicate white fruits that float easily on the spicy toast and fresh Golden Delicious apples and green plums. There is an attractive lift here, with a mineral edge to sharpen up the finish. Imported by Palm Bay International.

Made from 50-50 Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, this blend is firm in tannins and stuffed with lovely flavors of blackberry, cherry, currant, grilled meat, pepper, exotic spice and cedar. Brisk acidity and bold tannins suggest pairing with rich, fatty meats and cheeses now and over the next five years.
Robust and fleshy, this is soft, easy and slightly sweet. It has pie-filling flavors of blackberries and peppery spices.
Silky yet slightly grippy, this is a mineral-driven wine, with violet and spicy cardamom aromas atop bright, vibrant swathes of cherry and wild strawberry. This vineyard is where Joseph Swan himself first planted Pinot Noir, it retains all the promise and greatness of his initial discovery of this magical place along the Laguna Ridge.
This is a lovely Brunello with black cherry, plum, smoke, bacon, leather and a drying touch of crushed mineral on the nose. It is rich and concentrated, with a slightly sweet-smelling bouquet. The mouthfeel is compact, tight and polished—but there is excellent length too.
A wine that packs a punch of black fruits and dark tannins, it is very structured. Still dense and dry, it needs to soften so the berry fruits will show, giving a rich wine with a fresher aftertaste. Drink from 2016.

A little unripe, with some green, vegetal flavors. But it's dry, and shows enough cherry and oak richness to satisfy. The mouthfeel is nice and silky.
Fruit comes from three places for this wine, Bennett Valley, Alexander Valley and Knights Valley, exhibiting some good blending skill in the cellar. Red currant, clove, cedar and pencil all appear around a full-bodied, leathery texture and dots of black pepper and sage.
This youthful Nebbiolo-based wine opens with a thin, garnet color, offering sour aromas of berry and white cherry.
The pedigree of this Syrah is top-notch. The vineyard was planted by one of the owners of the fine Cabernet house, Surh Luchtel, and one of the winery's co-owners works at the von Strasser winery. The wine itself shows promise, but is a little too ripe and sweet for comfort, with jammy, stewed blackberry, cherry and cola flavors that have been well-oaked.
A well-balanced and medium-bodied offering; pear and other stone fruit flavors dominate the palate, while pear and lemon-lime aromas harmonize on the nose. Finishes with drying chalk and mineral notes. A solid, flavorful wine.

The wine is structured with concentrated tannins and dense fruit. It has spice, wood-aging flavors and a firm aftertaste. That means the wine needs time, so wait until 2019.
The Taylor family selected Clare Valley for its Cabernet affinity, but this Shiraz is a knockout. Yes, it's oaky—full of menthol, vanilla and toasted coconut—but there's just enough black cherry and plum fruit to support the wood. It's a plush, full-bodied wine with immense appeal, for drinking now–2025.
Here's a bright young Chardonnay marked by the crisp, tingly acids that you so often find in Edna Valley wines. The fruit is vibrant, offering a burst of Meyer lemons, limes, kiwis and figs, and the finish is thoroughly dry. The alcohol level, by the way, is a relatively low 13.5%.
This has a buttery, creamy softness that belies the usual hardness of Washington Cab. Excellent winemaking shows off not just the plum and cherry fruit, set against a thick wash of chocolaty oak, but also the firm acid and hints of citrus and earth that elevate the wine beyond the ordinary.
Showing the typical power and concentration of the 2010 vintage, this is a dense and structured wine. Good acidity and black plum flavors show through the big tannic texture and dry core. The wine still needs to age so drink from 2018. This is a 60% Merlot, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Cabernet Franc blend from Mallet Frères.

Sagrantino is a powerful and densely tannic wine that is gaining popularity in Italy and abroad. Lungarotti works hard to tame this variety through careful oak aging and low yields in the vineyard. The beautiful results boast dark fruit and exotic spice highlights.
Deep and sultry aromas of black fruit, mineral and toast mix with licorice gum drop and leather to form a good bouquet. The palate, however, runs more sharp than expected, with high acidity propelling lean, narrow pie-cherry flavors. A bit hollow but fresh and pure. Starts better than it ends. 70% Malbec and 30% Corvina.
This has already past its sell-by date. The color is tan and maderized, while the nose is soft and mushy, with raisiny aromas. Like the nose, this is flabby and past its prime in the mouth, with a bland, bitter finish.
Floral, sweet and powdery smelling, but pleasant. The palate is light and airy, with hardly any punch or kick. But that serves it well, and amid the sheets there's lime, green-apple notes and tropical shadings. Not bad for the price.
Ripe, fresh and crisp, this wine has layers of apples and cream, a sense of structure and full-bodied, lively fruit. This is a great apéritif wine.
This attractive, light and fruity wine is made from grapes from different vineyards. It has the freshest fruit and a light, open texture that offers pleasant acidity and raspberry flavors. Drink now.

Rich in tropical fruit, apricot and pear flavors, with a buttery, creamy texture, this is a satisfying Chardonnay made in the popular style. Brisk acidity makes it clean and balanced.
Yalumba's Muscat includes some lots from outside Rutherglen, but it's still an excellent example of fortified Muscat, featuring hints of caramelized cherries and a sweet, complex mélange of caramel, toffee and chocolate balanced by citrusy freshness.
Pretty good for its price, this wine shows classic Pinot character in its light, silky mouthfeel and zesty flavors of cherry and ripe persimmon. Although it's a little too sweet, many consumers will like that.
This firm's top Crozes-Hermitage cuvée is the Domaine Raymond Roure, which sees plenty of new wood in its upbringing, to judge from its somewhat coarse vanilla and cedar notes. There is plenty of blackberry fruit lurking beneath, so hopefully this will come together in time. Try after 2010.
A smooth and rounded wine that is full of ripe fruits. It has a hint of steely texture and minerality but the white fruit is the immediately attractive aspect of the wine. Drink this wine now.
Aromas of pressed apples and pears turn fleshier and riper on the palate of this forward, concentrated Riesling. Sumptuous peach and apricot flavors amass a honeyed sweetness on the midpalate, balanced neatly by squirts of tangerine acidity. It's an approachable, fruity wine to drink now through 2017.
Leathery, earthy berry aromas are generic but good. This is more acidic and narrow in the mouth than the aromas suggest, with tart flavors of raspberry and red plum. A lightly herbal, snappy feeling finish ends with a note of bitterness.
One of a range of wines under the Homage to Heritage import label, this fruit-driven wine has apple and green plum fruits, sustained by great acidity and a crisp, mineral texture. Drink from 2016.
A nice Pinot from a producer with a long track record in Carneros. Dry and silky, it has flavors of cherries, raspberries, Dr. Pepper cola and spices, with smoky-sweet oak in the background. Could have a touch more complexity, but it's a solid wine for drinking now.
There's plenty of cool-climate character in this vital, young Syrah. It's rich in flavors of freshly crushed black pepper, blackberry jam and bacon, with a smooth, velvety mouthfeel. It's a little light in texture, so drink it now with steak.
Vigna Paganelli shows amazing results with a bright fruit quality that translates into black cherry and blackberry. At the back are sophisticated tones of leather, tobacco and light touches of spice that give the wine depth and elegance. The most interesting aspect, however, is the mouthfeel that shows firm but beautifully ripe tannins that will help the wine age 10 years or more.
Soft and toasty, this wine is green, fresh and relatively lightweight for a Taittinger Champagne. There are attractive green plum flavors and a fresh, definite acidity to the finish.
This is roughly a 50-50 blend of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, showing a heavy concentration of vanilla flavor, often the mark of oak alternatives during the fermentation process. Some licorice notes come through, although the fruit is rather thin and herbal—not unexpected at this price.
Semisweet, with a lemon tart flavor, this Chenin also has some good, crisp acidity that makes it balanced and clean.
Plums, vanilla, toasty oak and a bit of chocolate fudge. The 2007 Angels Share features all of those flavors in a full-bodied, chewy Shiraz. The long, richly textured finish suggests pairing with grilled steak or lamb chops.
Why a 2005 vintage Merlot from this excellent vineyard is just being released six years later is one of those mysteries of wine. But it's a fine bottle, with plenty of life ahead. The tannins are softening up, and the fruit is smooth and ripe, with berries and plums and cassis. There is a generous wash of caramel and mocha also, and it's well-integrated and drinking at its peak.
This wine is plush, with aromas of blueberry, blackberry and cranberry. There are also hints of sage and red currant on the nose. The palate has more cranberry—but a bit sour—along with tart cherry and charred oak, all framed by astringent tannins and mouthwatering acidity. The finish is flavorful, but short.
Firm and tannic, a wine that, at this stage, is putting structure before fruit. That will change over 4–5 years as the dry tannins soften into the ripe plum and cranberry juice fruits underneath. While not weighty, this is a delicious, well-crafted wine.
Named for the clone so beloved by winemakers, this white is sourced from two estate vineyards. It opens in confectionary aromas that lead into a full-bodied style that's lushly voluptuous and exotic, yet completely in balance, a celebration of lemon curd, nutmeg and tarte Tatin.

This wine shows growing intensity the longer it stays in the glass and a very silky, polished feel in the mouth. Aromas include red fruit, spice and rosemary: this is a beautiful, balanced wine that will have a long life in your cellar.
There's a slight cobbler-like character to the nose of this wine, with mealy scents of peach bubble gum, banana and strawberry. The palate is more linear, with a pronounced line of acidity and flavors of green banana and orange citrus.
This smooth and inviting blend is impressive for the price. With mildly herbal Carmenère-driven aromas of olive and peppery spice, and then a deep and structured palate feel, Gold is golden. Look for a ton of ripe plum and berry flavor touched up by oak, chocolate and pepper accents. On the finish, it's spicy, peppery, smooth and complete. Drink now–2016.
Pickle, rubberband and briary berry aromas give way to a full but choppy palate with stewy, herbal berry flavors. Oak rises up on the finish in the form of burnt toast and mint. Standard but herbal; average for inexpensive Chilean Merlot.
A complex wine, exhibiting smoky tannins, rich fruit, a dark texture and concentration. Produced by the Moueix winemaking team, it feels complete with its sense of style and elegance as well as weight. Give this powerful wine many years in the cellar.
The best of the winery's 2011 block reserves, this displays a solid core of cherry fruit, augmented with some streaks of steel and stone. It's firm and tannic, with plenty of tart acidity behind the crisp fruit.
Big and brooding on the nose, with blackberry, violet, coffee and mineral aromas. The palate is smooth, rich and silky, with sweet, pure, jammy black fruit flavors and a pinch of chocolaty bitterness for balance. Finishes warm and minty, with an added dusting of cocoa. Big and bold more than complex or elegant.
Gisborne made its reputation with Chardonnay, and this is a decent representative. There's a bit of matchstick scent to get past on the nose, then reined-in apple and melon fruit, a bit of sweet corn and butter and some oaky notes that turn slightly varnishy on the finish.
Who knew that Montepulciano could be brought to such heights? This is a special, uncommon wine. It's ripe, from a great vintage, and it is shining brightly now but will hold for another three to five years at least. Full of black cherry, berry skins and generous but balanced tannins. Perfect with osso buco or rack of lamb. Imported by Empson (USA) Ltd.
Dry and rich in tannins, this southern Rhône-style blend has earthy flavors of black and red cherries, Provençal herbs, sandalwood, Chinese Five Spice and smoke. It will be great with roasted lamb with rosemary and garlic.
Aromas of underbrush, porcini mushroom, scorched earth and prune lead the nose on this full-bodied wine. The concentrated palate offers blueberry extract and black plum, while notes of mocha and black pepper add depth. It's still young, with big, chewy tannins and enough fresh acidity to age another decade or more. Drink 2015–2024.
Citrus-edged sweetness is far more apparent on the palate than the nose, but here it delivers wonderful hints of lemon oil and candied zest, cut through by lively acidity against hints of tropical mango. A wonderfully toned BA, this will pair well with both cheese and dessert.
Pretty, pale and poised, this offers light pear flavors with a touch of cinnamon. Snappy acidity and a clean, fresh finish all contribute.
It's not a bad name for this vineyard—Charmes. This wine, which expresses the nature of the vineyard, is certainly approachable, friendly almost. But there's also a steel fist there that demands time. And if you can't wait, it's a great wine to drink now.
This is soft, with ripe peach flavors and some toasty acidity. It's an easy style, perfumed and ready to drink.
A juicy wine, it is full of black currant fruits and vanilla wood flavors. It is generous, rounded with fine acidity and a fresh, open feel. Dry tannins will help the wine age for the medium-term. Drink from 2016.
Somewhat lean, this has a tart, grapefruit character that sits awkwardly with the otherwise fresh, green fruit character. Hard-edged.
Blackberry and vanilla make for a sweet, syrupy bouquet. The fruit on the palate is nice—it's mostly cherry and cassis. The finish is potent and slightly tart. Now it's hard to assess, as it's short on dimensions. Could use some time to integrate its components.
Dried apricots and herbal-grassy-peapod notes vie on the nose, but the flavors are intensely sweet and apricotty, with the botrytis character covering whatever other notes might be lurking underneath.
This ruby-colored wine offers aromas of black cherry and notes of green pepper and summer farmstand. It has flavors of black cherry, cherry cola and cassis, with soft tannins and a bright burst of acidity in the finish.

Made with 85% Sangiovese and 15% Merlot, this has aromas of violet, black-skinned berry and a whiff of baking spice. The round, chewy palate offers ripe morello cherry, red currant, white pepper and a hint of game. Supple tannins and bright acidity give it an easy-drinking vibe.
Simply delicious as refreshing, no-oak white wines go. There's telltale grapefruit and stony aromas in front of a pure, easygoing palate endowed with grapefruit, passion fruit and tangerine flavors. Still, it's not overly citric or one-dimensional; excellent Verdejo with a little extra in terms of refinement.
92–94 Freshness and lightness are the hallmarks of this ripe but very poised wine. Blackberry fruit flavors shine through the underlying tannins.
A finely crafted wine, but one that has some unripe elements. Sweet and supple in the mouth, this gets an A-plus for mouthfeel. But rhubarb and unripe red-fruit aromas and flavors mar the healthy chocolate, spice, vanilla, tobacco and blueberry. Finishes with plenty of oak flavor.
94–96. Barrel sample. This is a big, powerful, fruity wine that has restraint from its dense tannins. It's foursquare, chunky in character, already balanced, the tannins merging with the acidity. There is great aging potential.
This 100% Merlot is sourced from Sagemoor Farms' Bacchus and Dionysus vineyards. For the first time, there is no Cabernet Franc in the blend. Richly fruity, with loads of cherry, raspberry compote and black currant flavors, this melds in grace notes of chocolate and caramel, seamlessly. Thick and flat-out luscious, yet structured with a tannic spine that gives definition and focus all the way through.
This blend of Syrah and Touriga Nacional is rustic with some hard tannins and intense acidity. Since it is still young, the wine could soften but it seems to be more about its structure than its fruit.
Don't confuse this with authentic Prosecco from Italy. It's not that good. Dry, thin and textured, this has a rough mouthfeel.
This lively wine starts with aromas of white fruit, citrus and flowers. Ion the palate, exotic guava and pineapple and lemon mingle. An easygoing wine great for everyday enjoyment.
This wine's red berry, fragrant blue flower, aromatic herb and new saddle leather scents lift out of the glass. The firm palate offers juicy Marasca cherry, raspberry compote, cinnamon and anise notes set against tightly wound tannins and vibrant acidity. Youthfully austere, it needs time to fully come together. Drink 2022–2034.
Campo de Borja's “everyman's” red rides again in 2007. Sure, it's sweet and candied, but that's the 75% Garnacha talking. Flavors of berry, plum and chocolate are bold and forward, though not very complex. Seems more lush and heavy than in the past. Good for those who don't want to think much about what they're drinking.
One of three prestige cuvées from the producer featuring individual grape varieties, this pure Chardonnay is ripe and creamy. It's softer in dosage than the other bottlings, full of youthful fruitiness. Drink now.
Stylistically and individually, this is not what this critic is looking for in Albariño. The wine is moderately but noticeably oaked, and seeing that it dates from 2003, it has aged to the point that there's butterscotch and canned-corn aromas reminiscent of warm-climate Chardonnay. Lots of vanilla and butterscotch work the finish, and the acidity seems forced. Not poorly made but not really what Albariño should be.
Still young, fresh and vibrant, this Cab also is still dense in tannins, so be forewarned, although it's nothing that rich fare can't handle. It seems to be built for the cellar. The only concern is an overripe raisiny taste that would limit ageability.
A glorious wine, rich, ripe and delicious. It's dry, but lush in blackberries and cherries, tobacco and cola, with the Nickel & Nickel signature of new and one-year-old oak. Very tannic, this is clearly a wine that needs time. Should begin to come into its own after 2018.
The vineyard has been source to extraordinary Zinfandels from other producers, such as Howell Mountain Vineyards and D-Cubed. Now here it is under its own brand. It's a wonderful Zinfandel, powerful and complex, yet dry and elegant. The tannins are strong, but finely ground, and the raspberry, cherry, red currant, cola and Asian spice flavors are luscious. Drink now and through 2012.
Here's a simple, luminous sparkling Prosecco with firm, steady perlage and bright aromas of field flower, stone fruit, honeycomb and crushed white stone. The mouthfeel is dominated by fleshy, peachy sweetness.
A tight, green note of eucalyptus persists throughout the cherry, plum and oaken layers. The tannins are powdery and strong while the acidity is clean and refreshing.
A big, bold, exuberantly rich wine, classic Williams Selyem Chard. The underlying wine is all pineapples, peaches, pears and exotic tropical fruits, while oak adds elaborate layers of buttered toast, caramel, nougat and vanilla. Acidity is high, which will help the wine age through 2013.
A lovely bouquet of ripe peach, apricot and lemon notes. Fairly round peach, tart apple and earth flavors play on the palate and linger through the clean finish with its green apple and crisp mineral elements. From a well-regarded vineyard on a heart-stopping vertical slope, known for its elegant wines, everything here is beautifully defined. This will age well.
Winemaker Ed Fus does a superb job with grapes from the Stonetree Vineyard, as this tasty young Petite Sirah demonstrates. Violet, chalk, blueberry and citrus notes combine on the palate, continuing onto the finish that sets flower and tannin in stark opposition. This is what pure Petite Sirah from an excellent site tastes like, with no intrusive new oak flavors.
Scorched earth, underbrush, cured meat and grilled sage aromas lead the way together with a whiff of new leather. The ripe, juicy palate doles out black raspberry, succulent wild cherry, baking spice and a hint of tobacco. Packed but mature tannins retrain the rich fruit.
This is 100% Viognier, all stainless steel fermented, with more guts and concentration than the creamier barrel-fermented Viognier from this winery. Lime and pineapple fruit flavors are bracing and clean, moving into light peach and tangerine as they persist in the mouth.
Lightly herbal, scented with tart pear and tasting the same, this organically grown estate wine is King Estate's best Pinot Gris. Their signature bottling sets a good standard for the grape in Oregon; this elevates it with more detail, density and personality. The alcohol is a sensible 13%, allowing subtle green fruit and herb grace notes to emerge.
This outlier wine sparked much controversy at the Nebbiolo blind tastings because of the thickness of its extraction and the darkness of its appearance. Serracapelli is a beautifully rich wine that doesn't necessarily highlight Barbaresco typicity. You'll get opulent aromas of black cherry, spice, leather and moist tobacco. The mouthfeel is rich, round and velvety.
Medicinal black cherry aromas turn heavier and more prune-like with air. The palate is reasonably solid and healthy in feel, but monotonous and devoid of layering. Tastes tangy, zesty and mostly clean, with slightly baked flavors and a spot of heat.
Ripe, dark, a little oily and totally compelling from an aromatic standpoint. The palate is right where it should be, as neither the tannins nor the acidity are out of whack. Boysenberry, blackberry and plum flavors carry an herbal touch, and the finish is layered, with a lasting impression of coffee.
While the wood is still very apparent in this wine, it does also have the rich fruit as a balance. The acidity, dark berry fruits and a fine juicy character go with the firm tannins and spicy wood character. Drink from 2017.
Voluptuous, lush, a wine of great power. Packed with cedar-inspired flavors of blackberry and cherry jam, currants, cassis, cola, licorice and spice, wrapped into a texture of velvet and silk. Delicious and compelling. Only 126 cases produced.

The dark color suggests the heaviness of this blush wine. It's sweet and simple in raspberry jam and vanilla flavors.

The dryness and tannins of this wine are on the outside. Inside it has plenty of juicy fruit, sweet acidity and black plum flavors. Put the two together and this ripe wine offers plenty of potential. Drink from 2019.
Here's a slightly sweet, oak fermented 70-30 Vermentino-Viognier blend with a deep golden color and abundant notes of yellow fruit, vanilla, pine nut, mineral and some distant grassy shadings. It boasts surprising complexity and thick consistency: Just watch the glycerin move slowly down the sides of your glass. Not imported to the U.S.
A sweet-smelling Soave with simple aromas of peach, pear and honey presented in a very direct and immediate manner. It's thick and compact on the finish with loads of pineapple-like flavors.

This is a balanced wine with touches of honey and toast, along with ripe yellow and white fruits that are cut by a salty structure. Great acidity runs through the wine, giving a tight, steely, very pure aftertaste. Drink from 2017.
Full-bodied, soft and ultra-ripe, this six-variety blend, based on Zinfandel and Carignane, is sweet and rustic. It has jammy flavors of wild berries, molasses, chocolate and pepper spice.
Big ripe, fruity aromas promise a powerful wine. It does have weight, but it also offers fruity elegance that's borne up by firm tannins. With this good balance, it will age well, its black fruits bursting with attractive acidity.
The winery's philosophy is, if you're going to make a dessert wine, why not make it fabulously sweet instead of boringly off-dry? With 17.5% residual sugar, this indeed hits the limit of the sweetness scale. Yet it's superbly balanced with acidity, giving a refreshing balance to the intense apricot jam, lemon drop, candied ginger, pineapple crème brûlée and vanilla custard flavors. A tremendous success for a California dessert wine.
This Riesling has just the right amount of minerality balanced against apple and peach flavors, and an underlying core of lime. Fermented in stainless steel, it is bright and joyful to drink, boasting a long finish. Pour alongside all the classic pairings from Asian takeout to a proper curry.
Subdued acacia flower, toasted nut and dried aromatic herb aromas lead the nose while the palate offers yellow apple skin flavors and a hint of citrus zest. Bitter almond marks the lean finish.
Attractive fruity tones of red currant, raspberry and strawberry hull dance in the bouquet of this pretty rosé, graced by garrigue accents of lavender and rosemary. Flavors of red berry skin and peach pit unfold on the medium-weight palate, framed by soft tannins and a delicate spice note that lingers on the close.
At this price, it would be hard for this wine to live up to expectations—which is why we taste blind. But without any preconceptions, this wine was still delicious. The promising oaky aromas of honey drizzled over toast, coconut and vanilla are backed by white peach. It's tightly wound and less giving on the palate.
This opens with aromas of prune, fig, raisin and espresso. The palate offers ripe blackberry, cherry, and black pepper layered with intense mint, thyme and licorice sensations. It's young but well balanced, with just enough freshness to support the bracing tannins.
Layered aromas and rich but vibrant flavors help this medium-bodied wine stand out. It has a medium color with a brickish rim, while aromas suggest black tea and black cherry. A dry, tangy, but ripe fruit expression on the tongue lingers on the finish.
The official alcohol is 14.9%, but the wine tastes hotter, sweeter and more glyceriney than that. It's almost Porty, with caramelized black currant flavors and firm, dry tannins.
94-96 Barrel sample. An immense wine, but one that is keeping all its elements in balance. Big, rich and ripe, apricots, peach juice and dry honeyed botrytis, along with a good element of freshness.
This is the best Pinot Noir yet from the Drouhin estate; immensely concentrated and rich. The fruit is complex and penetrating, focused and long, layered throughout a generous and extended finish. Cherries and chocolate linger on the palate, resonating long after the wine has been swallowed.
Aromas of dark cherry, mocha and grilled game lead to the full-bodied palate, which has firm, muscular tannins and bright acids. Subtle notes of wild berry, undergrowth and tobacco slowly surface, lending this Syrah extra appeal.
A really terrific Chardonnay, even better than last year's bottling. Of course, the vintage was better, too. The wine is ripe and creamy and crisp, with luscious flavors of pineapples, pears, buttercream, vanilla custard, honeysuckle, smoke and minerals. Just beautiful, and at a good price, but only 260 cases produced.
This appellation blend is rich and lush with baked black-cherry aromas, touches of black cardamom and clove spice, and earthy rhubarb and beet notes. The palate packs a lot of forest-floor flavors, from loam to pine needles, into dark cranberry and tight raspberry fruit, leveled by pepper and pencil lead.
Fresh as well as ripe, with layers of toast, creamy pear and red apple flavors. Attractively spicy, ready to drink.
This structured wine has ripe black fruits followed by red berries. There is a good depth of flavor, the tannins giving the bright fruit weight and a mouthfilling character.

Dusty minerals and subtle black cherry and bramble notes lend delicacy to this elegant, but slightly fragile, wine. Fresh cranberry acidity is brisk and cutting on the palate, leading a moderately long finish framed with soft, chalky tannins.
This is a glamorous, fashionable wine that gives the pleasure you want in a bubbly. It's dryish and crisp, with doughy yeast, raspberry and lime flavors. A good price for a California sparkling wine of this quality.
Very sweet, honeyed flavors mark this dessert wine. It has apricot, pear, lemon and vanilla richness, brightened by crisp acidity. It's absolutely delicious for drinking now.
This is a broad, sweet, full-bodied dessert wine that lacks the crisp acids necessary for a higher degree of balance. Instead, it delivers intense honey and pineapple flavors that stick stubbornly to the palate. Probably best with sweet desserts.
This Cairanne bottling is a solid addition to the Perrin family's operation, featuring slightly lifted aromas of crushed herbs, cracked pepper and ripe cherries. Flavors of cherries and dried spices fill the mouth, with just enough dusty tannins to provide structural integrity and modest longevity. Drink now–2017.
A beautiful Cabernet Sauvignon. May be a little lighter in body than some, but trades richness for elegance and impeccable structure. So pretty and polished, with entirely satisfying blackberry, spice and cedar flavors. A great accomplishment at a production of 42,000 cases.
One of the many labels owned by the Grassa family of Domaine du Tariquet, this is so light and fresh that it just floats across the palate. It is citrus-crisp, with a tight apple skin texture. Great for apéritifs. Screwcap.
Aromas of apple, crushed stone and thyme come together on this vibrant white. The medium-bodied palate offers green pear, juicy nectarine, dried herb and flinty mineral alongside lively acidity. A note of bitter almond fills in the finish.
Hints of ripe peach creep in with the yellow plum notes on the nose. The palate adds a generous if frothy creaminess to these flavors, making them fizz and fill the mouth with their fruity freshness. Behind all this lurks a grown-up backdrop of biscuity richness that allows for a restrained dosage and a very dry finish. Lovely now, will benefit from bottle age. Drink 2016–2019.
Meaty and brooding, this is a taut, focused and dusty wine made from organically and biodynamically grown grapes. Tart cranberry notes give it a sharpness that accentuates the deeper, richer layers of black fruit.
Resplendent in white pepper, aromatically defined by it in fact, with a touch of cedar, this is a smooth, full-bodied Syrah that's mighty good, a duet of cool and warm-climate character. Pair with braised meats thick in earthy mushrooms.
This aged for 18 months in new French barriques, and the influence of that is marked. Cedary, gently sawdusty notes and a touch of nail polish are apparent on the nose, while the palate is admirably full bodied and richly textured. The finish is generally velvety, but also shows hints of varnish or paint thinner. Overall, the raw materials are impressive, but the wine comes across as a bit disjointed.
Spicy, briary berry and leather aromas are full and firm. On the palate, this feels fresh, with good body and depth. Flavors of black plum, blackberry and black currant are spicy but not pushy, while the finish is not overly oaky or heavy.
Starts off with beautiful scents of ripe peaches, orange blossom and a briny minerality, then delivers all of that and more in a slightly creamy, sensuous mouthful of flavor. The purity of ripe fruit is noteworthy, extending through the long, filigreed finish.
Lush and appealing, this is one of the more appropriately named of the Chocolate Box wines. Slightly jammy raspberry fruit is coated in chocolate; even the tannins come across as softly dusty, even vaguely cocoa-like. Drink over the next year or two.
This lively Chardonnay starts with lemon, lime and pear on the nose, followed by a terrific combination of crisp citrus fruit and oaky, white fruit roundness. Elegant but fun, it's a perfect food wine. Think spicy ethnic cuisine, grilled seafood, salads.
This new release of Bésoleil is 80% Grenache; 5% Syrah and 15% Mourvèdre. Intensely aromatic, bursting with black cherry, strawberry and raspberry aromas, its luscious palate is replete with black fruits. There are streaks of tree bark, a whiff of smoke and above all intensity of fruit.
This simple wine offers aromas of citrus, dried chamomile and a whiff of hay. The easy palate offers nectarine and lemon zest alongside brisk acidity.
Lange's reserve has a resonant, spicy depth that elevates it above the well-made regular bottling. Tight and showing medium concentration, it shows a herb accent, with earthy tannins framing the tart cherry fruit. A hint of coconut marks the finish.
Though not labeled as such, this is single vineyard Malbec all coming from Canyon Ranch Vineyard with varietal notes of plum and black pepper. Aged in one-quarter new American and French oak, barrel spices play off the elegant fruit flavors that largely paint around the edges.
Spanish broom, aromatic herb and orchard fruit aromas lift out of the glass while the rounded palate offers white peach, honeydew melon and a white almond note. Fresh acidity brightens the creamy flavors.
Tastes more like a Zinfandel than a Cabernet, with a briary mouthfeel and flavors of black pepper and weedy green nettles. But there's lots of blackberry and black currant richness, and the wine is totally dry, with full-bodied, thick tannins. Unusual for a Cabernet, but a nice, complicated red wine for drinking with grilled meats.
Here's one for the cellar. It's an intense, massively concentrated wine, packed with blackberry, black currant, dark chocolate and crême de cassis flavors. If that sounds delicious, it is, and the tannins are as fine and complicated as Napa gets. So tasty now, you can drink it with a great steak, and should easily develop bottle complexity over the next 8–10 years, perhaps much longer.
Fresh and bright, the nose of this wine is filled with bramble fruit, lavender and violet candy. The palate is racy, with red cherry, pomegranate, lavender and violet. Smooth tannins lead to a silky finish.
There is a rich feel to this wine, its soft, velvet texture accompanied by juicy acidity. It has elegance, not huge tannins, and offers a fresh finish.
If it wasn't for the unbalanced spirity element to this wine, it would rate higher. The concentration and the dried fruit and lemon jelly flavors are attractive. But that spirit comes through at the finish.
Many good bargains like this interesting Shiraz can be found from the Robertson region. Vanilla and leather play large roles, with Provençal herb aromas and flavors of purple fruit. Firm tannins and a hint of sweetness keep high acidity in check. Imported by Cape Classics.
For one of their lower-priced bottlings, this blend of 55% Grenache, 40% Mourvèdre and 5% Cinsault is a great deal. The nose shows exuberant black raspberry, scarlet rose petals and fresh lilacs against a backdrop of dewy thyme and oregano. That herbal component carries strongly to the palate, giving nuance to tangy plum fruits. The savory touch would pair with everything from pasta to Asian-spiced beef.
Medium-straw in color, this wine offers aromas of Asian pear, guava and juniper berry. Featuring flavors of Seckel pear, honeysuckle and anise seed, it is bright on entry, goes through a short cool phase, and then brings the brightness back with a finish that includes lingering notes of white peach.
Very concentrated notes of zesty grapefruit peel mingle with punchy, peppery watercress on a rather concentrated palate. Freshly ground pepper intriguingly pops up here and there. This is a weighty wine that definitely belongs on the table.
Blackberry fruit makes friends with black earth, coffee syrup, dill and dried garden herbs on this nuanced bottling. The palate blends cherry cola with milk chocolate, and boisterous acidity with black rock minerality, finishing on a cream-soda spritz.
Subtle aromas of plum, blackberry and a whiff of baking spice emerge in the glass. The polished palate offers black cherry, clove and a hint of tobacco alongside sleek, smooth tannins. Drink through 2018.
From parcels of old vines in the Côte des Blancs, this limited-edition wine is a beautiful Chardonnay. It is finely woven, tightly textured and crisp in apple skin and lemon notes. Concentration from the low-yielding vines gives great depth and the potential to still age well. Drink this exceptional wine from 2017.
With small percentages of Merlot and Malbec, this Cab offers distinct herbal notes, its body medium in weight and acidity. Clove and fig round out the profile.
Cherry, blueberry and vanilla are weaved together to create a solid nose with delicate balances between fruit and oak. In general, the nose is not as lively as other wines from this vintage but many of those wines lack this ease and approachability. Dusty, firm tannins suggest a pairing with lamb shanks and garlic roasted potatoes.
Dark-blue fruit, thyme, sweet barrel spices and mineral aromas lead to pitch-black fruit flavors that show the warmth of the vintage but retain their balance. The tannins provide some pucker.
Flavors of green hay, tart juniper berry and gooseberry surface in this Sauvignon Blanc, in addition to richer notes of Meyer lemon and vanilla. It's dry and elegantly complex, with a honeyed richness. This shows the versatility to pair across a huge range of cuisines.
This medium-bodied wine is very fruity in aroma, and exudes ripe pear and fig flavors. Add in creamy vanilla accents and a very soft texture and the effect is almost sweet.
Pure minerals, peach and melon aromas come with a hint of leesy dust. This wine is elegant, chiseled and minerally on the palate. Flavors of dusty apple and citrus end long and stony, with class. Laxas is a top-flight Albariño producer and this vintage is one of its best. Drink now.
Aromas of pear, Gala apple, nectarine, lemon spritz and wet dough show on the yeasty nose of this bottling. Creamy bubbles arise on the zippy sip, with flavors of dough and yellow-apple skins proving quite tart.
On the nose this wine remains ripe and vital, but subdued. Tobacco, vanilla and baking-spice scents ride on top of mature berry aromas. A rubbery, healthy mouthfeel is round and showing pulse, while flavors of baked berry fruits, spice and cocoa finish dry, earthy and composed. Drink this mature Rioja now through 2018.
Dark and chocolaty, with grainy tannins under deep cassis and black cherry fruit. Full-bodied and chewy, with coffee grounds and spices filling in the finish.
Aromas of black fruits, barrel toast and marshmallow set up a palate that's tannic and choppy but full of life. Savory, spicy berry flavors come with chocolaty oak notes prior to a finish that's rough and tannic but true.
Sourced from vineyards on the east coast of Corsica, this attractive, fruity wine is made from 100% Sciaccarellu. Its lively, light and crisp red currant and lemon flavors make it ready to drink.
The Justice cuvée pushes the fruit forward, with clean strawberry, raspberry and cherry flavors highlighted by streaks of pine needle. Behind that, one senses a wine still knitting itself together, dropping off a bit in the midpalate. The tannins have a pleasant tea-leaf taste. It's best to tuck this away until 2016–2017.
From a new, small producer, this vibrantly peppery wine captures the power and grace the variety is capable of when grown on the far reaches of the coast. That peppery quality follows through on the palate, buoyed by juicy acidity and smoothly layered blackberry, tobacco and tea flavors. Exquisitely made and worth seeking out.
This opens with an unusual but intriguing fragrance of candied citrus accented by balsamic notes, aromatic herbs and slate. The bright, linear palate delivers succulent pineapple, nectarine and pink grapefruit energized by mineral notes.
The Jaen in Portugal is unique to the Dão (in Spain it is called Mencía). It gives, as in this wood-aged wine, a richly tannic character, full of red-berry fruits. The wood aging creates the hint of toast that is still present. Drink from 2018.
The cherry and smoke aromas wear an attractive olive-herb note, but the fruit could use more weight and definition. Feels like many Merlots, with its very soft, plummy mouthfeel, although the flavor range is darker, showing more blackberry and cassis. Feels a little slick or sappy, but the cassis and licorice flavors on the back end pull this beginner's Cab through.
An adequate heavyweight but there's a shortage of clarity and zest. The nose starts out cheesy and waxy, and the color is distinctly yellow. In addition, it's a little mealy in the mouth, with mango and soft tropical flavors. Fleshy on the finish, and seeming already on the fade.
Fresh and easy drinking, this opens with aromas of Spanish broom, exotic fruit and a heady whiff of Mediterranean brush. The sunny palate doles out green apple, aromatic herb, nectarine and a mineral note alongside tangy acidity.
Give this 100% Cabernet just a little more time in the cellar. Even at six-plus years of age, its tannins are hard, although the primary blackberry fruit flavors are beginning to dry out and become earthy. It should approach its peak around 2015.
An excellent Washington Chardonnay, whole cluster pressed, barrel fermented, unfined and naturally stabilized. Minimum intervention winemaking, giving extra nuances of crisp citrus, rind, pear and blossoms. Fragrant and food friendly.
Fresh aromas of strawberry and toasty spice lead on this friendly rosé from Juno. On the palate, it's soft and subtle, with vibrant fruit flavors and a delicate finish. A great everyday wine that will pair especially well with seafood and summer fare.

Largely Chardonnay and Riesling, this wine offers aromas that include peach, pear, melon and almond. It's full in feel, lightly sweet with citrus and stone-fruit flavors that linger.
Fresh, light and fruity, it has ripe strawberry flavors, bright acidity and just a touch of caramel. It is full in the mouth, with a rounded feel and a soft texture at the end.
This thick, meaty Amarone opens with distinct notes of root beer and teriyaki backed by black fruit and blueberry tart. The wine is smooth and rich with polished tannins and a long fruit-driven fade.
Good as this wine is, it's very rustic nature. The tannins are hard and brittle, the acidity is high, and the wine veers between leaner tobacco notes and superripe currants. But its heart is pure cherry. Will age forever, without gaining complexity, so enjoy it now with your favorite pasta and tomato sauce, and plenty of grated cheese.
This opens with aromas of French oak, vanilla, baking spice and steeped plum. The one-dimensional palate shows dried black cherry, sour cranberry and espresso with close-grained but not very persistent tannins that dry out the finish.
Initially this smells oaky, pasty and lactic, but with time it opens to reveal blackberry and cassis aromas. The palate is lively and offers healthy acidic cut. Flavors of creamy berry, oak and plum end with a creamy feeling and lightly lactic tasting finish. Overall this is a polished wine with minimal varietal character.
A terrific Cabernet made from a blend of various Paso Robles vineyards. Just delicious, a young, softly appealing wine brimming with blackberry, cherry, currant, mocha and cedar flavors. Beautiful now, especially with a grilled steak or lamb chop.
Lancaster burst on the scene with enormous buzz, perhaps before they had really earned it. Steadily but surely, they've built up the wine, and the '04 is the best ever. It's a gorgeous Cab, softly complex, rich in cassis, cherry, spice and oak flavors anchored with warm, earthy tannins. In fact, the earthiness stands it in good contrast to Napa Valley, making it wholesome and complete.
Ripe yellow peaches laced with honey and beeswax perfume this off-dry Finger Lakes Riesling from Long Island's Anthony Nappa. It's tart and fresh on the palate, with lemon and tangerine acidity cutting through savory flavors of apple and pear. The finish is brisk and sprightly.
). Rubiolo is a soft and lush Chianti Classico with ripe fruit aromas backed by easy leather and tobacco. The wine shows nice lines and supple spice.
Craig's Howell Mountain Cab typically is powerful and ripe, with bigtime tannins that require aging. The 2005 is such a wine. Made with a drop of Merlot, it shows black cherry and cassis fruit accented with lots of toasty new oak. But it's really young, stinging the palate with astringency. Should negotiate the next 10 years with ease.
100% Sangiovese, this pale pink wine has notes of bubblegum, wild strawberry and spice. It drinks dry with medium-bodied flavors that linger on the finish.
A tart, cranberry- and raspberry-flavored wine, this young, high-acid style of Pinot has a charming, Burgundian feeling to it. The snappy red fruits are underscored with citrus, and the balance is disarmingly light, but not simple or dull.
Quadra's Brut Rosé sparkling wine offers a delicate pink color and compelling aromas of stone fruit, toasted bread, crème de cassis and subtle waves of cinnamon spice. The mouthfeel is smooth, rich, long-lasting and offers a piquant touch of crushed white pepper.
This candied rosé is a blend of Touriga Nacional and Syrah. Full of soft red berry fruits with only light acidity, it is off-dry to taste. A touch of pepper at the end is less attractive.
Extremely fresh on the nose with a touch of honeysuckle and hint of passionfruit, this bottling also offers fruity lime-blossom scents. There is grip and balance to the sip, with lime skins, grass, more passionfruit and rounded honeydew-melon notes that grow riper on the palate.
Dry and serious, this firm wine is classic Bordeaux. It has weight, a core of tannins and black currant fruitiness that needs time to fully integrate with the dense structure. Give this exemplary wine another five years.
With a touch of raisins and some heat in the finish, this is a pretty ripe Zinfandel. It's not for the faint-hearted. But it's classic California Zin, offering huge blackberry, cola, mocha and black pepper flavors that go on and on into a long finish. Demands rich fare, especially spicy, saucy barbecue.
Great price for a crisp, dry, clean Chardonnay that's so friendly with food. Tart acidity and a touch of smoky oak bring a smoky, vanilla richness to the tangerine, pineapple and pear flavors. Nice with grilled shrimp or mushroom and asiago cheese risotto.
Like a breath of springtime in the California hills. Hints of new green grass, acacia blossom, clover honey and buttercup lead to notes of cassis in this bone-dry, crisply acidic wine, which shows how beautifully Lake County deals with Sauvignon Blanc.
This wine is 100% varietal. Pungent aromas of blue fruit, high-toned herb, pencil lead and plentiful barrel spice lead to exceptionally well-balanced polished fruit flavors. Lightly grainy tannins provide support. The balance is exquisite as is the lengthy finish.
Black cherry, chocolate and menthol accents color the nose of this ripe and plump Barbera d'Alba. The wine is firm and generous in the mouth with a chewy, slightly sweet finish. It sees one year of oak for extra spice on the close.
Here's an herbal, floral Chardonnay from Northern Italy with a fresh, garden green intensity rounded off by soft notes of exotic fruit, citrus and peach blossom. The mouthfeel is lean and thin and the wine offers spicy freshness on the close.

This unusually lively and vivid wine offers a nice twist on the variety, offering fresh pineapple, herb and lemon flavors, dazzling acidity and great balance despite its relatively high level of alcohol. Grown on the winery property, it's another good example of Holly's Hill's emphasis on purity of flavor.
Mission Estate is New Zealand's oldest winery, established in 1851 by French missionaries. The Syrah vines are young by comparison, but this wine is matured in tank, so what you smell and taste is unmarked by wood. The result is just a bit greenish—the cracked pepper and plum notes pick up hints of green olive and dried herbs on the way to a dusty finish.
This wine's juicy acidity and raspberry flavor are delicious and upfront. Along with all this fruit, the tannins act as support, lending structure and aging potential.
With a touch of wood aging, this ripe and creamy wine has a light edge of toast. Crisp with lemon and ripe with apricots, it has a fresh character that is filled out and given richness with a touch of honey at the end. Drink from 2016.

Scents of spring flowers and grapefruit float out of the glass on the zesty sparkler. The palate offers pear, lemon-drop and white peach alongside vibrant acidity. Fun, persistent bubbles give it an informal edge.
The schist soil of the vineyard shows in the smoky, spicy character of the wine. It is full of life, ready to set out on a long journey of development, as the blackcurrant and ripe berry fruits mingle with nutmeg, the whole shot through with fresh fruit acidity. The final is rich, long lasting.
A very big Pinot, obviously chosen for its special designation due to the concentration of fruit. Almost Grenache-like in cherries, cassis, cocoa and glyceriney richness, it's a dry, silky wine whose elaborate oak finishings add opulence. Despite the Loire-like weight, it's a compelling Pinot that evolves as it warms in the glass, suggesting ageability. Drink now–2010.
Gritty, tarry cassis, licorice and toasted oak flavors lead to a full but grabby palate. This blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Petit Verdot deals dark, toasty, peppery black-fruit flavors in front of an oaky, spicy finish with firm tannic bite.
Oaky, heavily roasted aromas of hickory, baking spices, coconut and exotic black-fruit scents feed into a chunky but easygoing palate with spicy, barrel-rich flavors of hickory and vanilla as well as baked berry and leather. A ripe, slightly rubbery finish is generous. Drink through 2018.
Clear as day in the glass, with forced oak and spring flowers in the nose. In a word, it's strange. In the mouth, you'll get sweetness and other flavors not generally associated with Chardonnay. It's not necessarily a bad white wine, but it is definitely at odds with typical Chardonnay.
With its high proportion of Cabernet Franc (45%), this is a finely perfumed rich wine. It has great tannins, a smoky character that comes from the wood. The tannins are quite marked, giving a tight firm edge to the wine that otherwise has generous fruitiness. This is a complex wine, impressive, and likely to age over many years. Drink from 2028.
A firm and concentrated wine, this is dark and full bodied. It shows the superripe fruit produced by the 2009 vintage. Attractively full and juicy, it has extra weight and a dark chocolate flavor, plus a spicy finish. Age for 2–3 years.
Still quite firm in dry tannins, with bell pepper, herb and coffee flavors, although there's a core of cherry fruit. Doesn't seem like it's going anywhere.
High-toned and fruity, the Abondante mixes cherry candy with tropical flavors. Full-bodied, robust and ready to drink.
An unique dessert wine, this is a late-harvest effort made from Encruzado grapes. Its deep golden color and scents of burnt orange peel and honey lead into a wine that's not very sweet--and so best paired with foie gras or a cheese course. Traces of nuts, oranges and honey finish a bit short.
Here's an unusual Pinot Bianco with a layered nose that includes tones of dried hay, stone fruit, peppermint and natural rubber. The mouthfeel is easy and informal but there is enough texture here to pair with roasted chicken or fish.
This wine is tight with the lightest hints of riper fruit in the future. It has spice, toast flavors and suggestions of yellow fruit. Wait to drink this wine until 2017.
The nose gives little away but once tasted, there is an understated but deeply stony, pear-fruited and textured palate. This is less about fruit and more about soil and mouthfeel. There is depth and subtle warmth, quite some backbone and a fresh, lingering finish.
Charred beef, blackberries, elderberries and sweet tar aromas show on this small-batch wine made by a couple from Texas. There's decent density on the palate, with lots of blackberry fruit and black pepper as well as extremely bright acidity that will keep this wine alive for years.
Honey-roasted almonds, seared lemon vinaigrette and honeydew melon show on the delicious nose of this off-dry wine from an extreme coastal vineyard above Cambria. Though slightly sweet, it remains rich and intriguing, with lots of citrus peel, grapefruit pith, squeezed oranges and touches of petrol.
There is good concentration to the estate-grown fruit, which mixes raspberry, boysenberry and cassis and provides a firm and lasting core of flavor. Some tasters may find the wine slightly reductive, with a burnt rubber quality; for others it will just be toasty and a bit tannic. Give it time to breathe and it opens up into a full-bodied, flavorful Pinot Noir with some medium-term aging potential.

Charred beef tips, grilled whole fish, wet dirt and heavy tar combine for a pungent, serious nose on this Syrah from a vineyard planted by Central Coast pioneer Dale Hampton.

Finally it looks as if Lascombes is back on form. With its huge vineyard, a good selection of the best fruit has been the issue, and this has happened with 2003. It's not a huge wine, but there is smooth, polished fruit, layered with wood and  dusty tannins. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates.
A beautiful expression of Sangiovese, this shows delicate and elegant characteristics of wild berry and light spice. The finish is silky and crisp, and the wine would stand up nicely to breaded veal or roast chicken.

Generic, solid aromas of medicinal raspberry and cherry lead to a gum-burning, tannic palate of rooty cherry and plum flavors. Finishes with verve but also stand-out acidity and grab. Regular in every way.

The medium- to full-bodied palate demonstrates a judicious balance between its firm tannins and acids. The finish is seductive with its lingering notes of mocha and dark berry compote.
Here's an interesting rosé fans of obscure winegrapes will love. It's 90% Tibouren, an old variety indigenous to Provence that's known for its finesse but also for its difficulty in the vineyard.

Hints of apricot and peach are subtle, with the emphasis being on the wines crisp acids and dry finish.

The 2006 vintage was erratic, but Nick Goldschmidt has pulled a rabbit out of a hat with this fabulously complex and rewarding 100% Cabernet.

This is one of those wines that's compelling to drink now, but should evolve over the next 10–15 years.

Gently ripe wine, soft, with just the lightest hint of herbaceousness. The wine is open, with an attractive core of red apples and lime.
This is a top-dog Malbec from start to finish. Aromas of cassis, black plum and blackberry are well oaked and in harmony with each other.

Manfred Prüm's 2009 Wehlener Sonnenuhr Kabinett is a bit bigger than usual, and perhaps a bit drier as well at 9% abv, but it still displays hallmark notes of slate, lime and apple. Fruit, mineral and gingery spice notes linger on the finish.
Lipsmacking plum and currant accent a touch of chocolate in this soft, approachable, estate-driven wine from the heart of Stags Leap. Classically elegant with plenty of California oomph, it's a study in balance and fruity bravado.

Just a bit of Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon is added to the blend, most of which comes from the Ciel du Cheval, Tapteil and Weinbau vineyards. In this cooler vintage, an herbal character emerges, lending firm tannins and structure to the tight black cherry and cassis core.
Raisin and other sweet, soft aromas are friendly but don't really bring it. The palate follows suit; it's chubby and jammy, with sweet berry flavors, a touch of raisin and a roasted, candied finish. Very nice and true to the region, albeit on the soft and easy side.
A very nice Zinfandel for drinking steaks, chops and cheeses. It's dry and complex, offering earthy flavors of black and red currants, sage, tobacco and pepper. Lacks a bit of stuffing, but elegant and crisp.

Cheerful and bright, this luminous sparkler offers dried fruit aromas with yeast and baked bread tones as well. It has aged nicely over the past five years but maintain the freshness and crispness you look for in an Italian sparkling wine.
A bit earthy. One hundred percent new oak dominates the jammy black cherry, violet and herb flavors. Feels somewhat tired, even though it's only three-plus years old.

Dry, robust and gritty in tannins, this country-style wine also has a hefty dose of acidity. Its blackberry flavors are tinged with earthy notes of coffee and tobacco. Needs something rich and oily, like lasagna.
This smells slightly reduced, with rubber ball aromas over black cherry fruit. Soft tannins leave a flat impression in the finish.
It's not Clonakilla's top-of-the-line Shiraz-Viognier, but it's still darn good, and in its savory notes of tapenade, leather and peppery spice, it provides a nice alternative to common fruit-driven Shiraz.

Overtly sugary, basically a dessert wine, with raspberry, vanilla and spice flavors.
Just barely acceptable, this soft, semisweet Cab has Lifesaver candy flavors of cherries and raspberries.
Yeasty funk still obscures the aromas on the nose. The palate, however, speaks of fluid freshness, of richness and power channelled into precision and softness.

The length just gets you.

While the winery's Notre Passion bottling is 50-50 Grenache and Syrah, Les Promesses gives Grenache more weight (70%), blending it with 25% Syrah and 5% Mourvèdre. The result is a similarly silky, charming wine with hints of clove and cracked pepper in its raspberry-cherry fruit. Drink now–2012.
This savory blend of Syrah, Grenache, Petite Sirah and Viognier (developed, Bridlewood claims, after tasting through the winery's lots 175 times) delivers black pepper, vanilla, stewed fig and roasted pork to the nose. It then clings to flavors like sage and sautéed plum that are more often found in cool-climate Syrah. The tannins are slightly rough, so this may be best in 2015, but it's drinking well now.
Aromas of mature dark-skinned berry, scorched earth and a whiff of exotic spice unfold in the glass. The round, chewy palate doles out juicy blackberry, fleshy black cherry, cinnamon and a hint of cocoa while velvety tannins provide a smooth framework.
The nose is flat, with good mineral character but only moderate ripeness and little fruit. The wine picks up in the mouth, with appealing green apple notes and mouthwatering acidity. A bit too crisp and dry for an apéritif but would pair well with raw shellfish.
Unique in character, this wine features powerful white pepper and spice drop notes layered over white peach and melon flavors. It's rather big and round in the mouth, but it also has a bit of a hole in the midpalate. Turns peppery and spicy on the finish.

Another oaky effort, which shows some juicy berry scents but fades quickly in the mouth. Some tart, light fruit, green tea tannins, and smoky barrel toast.
A clean and simple wine defined by crisp grapefruit and honeysuckle notes. Some of the appeal waned in the mouth because of its lean and neutral appearance.
Lots of smoky leather and crushed black pepper in this wine, a clear sign the Syrah comes from a cool climate. Crisp acidity, too, giving the wine a bright mouthfeel. Might even have a drop of Viognier. There's a citrusy lift to the blackberries and black currants. Should develop smoothly through 2013.
The aromas are attractively fresh, while the palate is more towards full, fat fruits. So the green perfume gives way to melon and pear only just touched by citrus acidity. Treat this as a food wine, not an apèritif. This wine was formerly sold under the Cockburn Port brand.
This Rhône-style blend of a rosé is a light, enjoyable sipper of tart red berries, bubble gum and sharp citrus.
This lovely Sauvignon Blanc was cold fermented, then aged on the lees in neutral oak barrels. That was the perfect way to treat the grapes, which were grown in St. Helena.

Very Muscat, very aromatic, this is a light, crowd-pleasing apéritif wine that dances on the palate. It's dry, but the lychee-like perfumed flavor and the spice make it softer and easier. Glass stopper.
Sometimes in a challenging vintage such as 2009, it is the least expensive, blended wines that benefit most, perhaps because grapes normally destined for the single-vineyard wines are redirected. Here, rich fruit flavors highlighted with streaks of caramel and toffee get things rolling quickly. Berries and cherries, firm acids, pretty spice and a lingering butterscotch finish.
A collaborative project between winemaker John Wright (who throws concerts at his Buellton facility), Counting Crows singer Adam Duritz and artist Felipe Molina, this excellent wine shows squeezed blueberries and aromatic violet and lavender on the nose. The complex palate combines ripe purple fruit with tar and chopped mint.
This wine's earthy nose offers some hazelnut and apple nuances, and those flavors carry to the palate assertively but with a slight edge. It could use a little more acidic zing, but it would still be appealing served with mozzarella and prosciutto.
Though richly perfumed with rose petals and elderflower, the flowery aromatics are reined in by bright lemon and citrus peel notes. The palate is plush and rich with flavors evocative of earl grey tea served with rose petal jam, with a gentle acidity to keep things fresh.
This harkens back to the days of white Zinfandel, though it's not from that grape. But it offers similar simple, sweet, generic fruit, best for drinking chilled on a hot summer afternoon.
Bruce McGuire makes a strong case for the potential of Petit Verdot—a variety not often bottled on its own—in the Santa Ynez Valley. Baked blackberry, licorice and cocoa scents show on the playful nose, while black cherry, cocoa dust, cardamom and anise flavors light up the palate.
Earthy berry and raisin aromas announce a warm, ripe wine. This feels plump, grapy and chunky, with moderate acidity. Grapy, bold flavors of raspberry, prune and cherry are earthy and loamy, while ripeness and a raisiny element carry onto the finish. Drink through 2019.
Voiles (sails) seems an appropriate name for a wine that comes from near the resort of Saint-Tropez. This attractively packaged wine is soft and rounded, with just the right amount of acidity and red currant fruits to keep it fresh and fruity.
The Malan family makes a ripe, balanced Chardonnay, 100% wood-fermented in French oak. The style is rich and creamy, and there are attractive hints of honey from the partial use of malolactic fermentation. The downside of that is a lack of acidity, but for those who want rich, fat Chardonnay, this is it.
Made in a lighter style, this wine is nonetheless rich and complex in flavor, proving that Pinot Noir doesn't have to be heavy to be really good. It's dry and spicy, with raspberry, cherry, red licorice and Dr. Pepper flavors. Drink now.
The mouthfeel is brittle and the acidity is brisk on this good regional expression of Pinot Noir. It shows the variety's silkiness, with sour cherry candy, cranberry and rhubarb tea flavors. Drink now–2016.
With brawny tannins and a taste of tar and oak, this wine is predominantly about dark, black fruit, the spicy finish measured and complementary to the rest of the components. It's a classic barbecue wine.
This is the family's top wine—a blend of selected Pinot Noir and Chardonnay lots from their 25 acres. Made to be aged, it still shows its extra-crisp fruit and acidity, needing time to soften and bring out its full, rich potential. Drink from 2019.
Even at 10 years, this is still just setting out. While it doesn't have the immensity of the 1996, it has a great intense grapefruit, pear and fresh apricot series of flavors that come through with toast, ripeness and a suggestion of almonds. 7–8 years aging.
Tasted in late August, there was a spritziness that may well disappear by the time this wine is available on the market. That fizziness is by no means unattractive. It brings a bright, Champagne-like kick to the Meyer-lemon, lime, apricot and papaya flavors that make this Sauvignon Blanc so savory.
There's unending floral fragrance on the nose of this bottling. Hibiscus, lilacs, rosewater and cherry blossoms decorate cranberry fruit, kola-nut spice and wet slate. A potpourri power shows on the palate, with lavender and oregano laid across pomegranate, bolstered by an earthy tobacco-leaf spice.
Über-simple and rather diluted, this offers sour cherry and notes suggesting sweet and sour sauce. It's vigorous with vivacious acidity.
A bit tart, with a bite that comes from irregular tannins and zesty acidity. Yet it's dry and elegantly silky, with good cherry, berry, cola and spice flavors. Give it a good decant.
From dry-farmed estate vines, this savory, classically styled red offers nuances of cedar, dried herb and peppercorn. It's aromatically reminiscent of the forest that surrounds the estate, delivering a balanced landscape of subtle, elegant flavor and length.
The Estate bottling, at least at the moment, is a light and delicate wine, with more than a hint of beetroot and stem. The cherry fruit is pleasant and a bit thin, but the wine has some complexity, which shows in the residual flavors of orange peel.
Ripe and extracted in blackberry, currant, mocha and oak flavors, this Cab, tasted at the age of 3-plus years, still was freshly sharp and jammy. You might want to cellar it for a few years to let it mellow and knit together.
Rich and layered on the nose, this wine shows peppercorn, bacon fat and blackberry jam aromas. It is full and soft on the palate, with deeply rich yet still a tad tart boysenberry and elderberry fruit as well as an asphalt-driven grip.
A savory and earthy spin on a cool climate vineyard, this bottling offers salty dried meat, iron, dust, red plum and raspberry aromas. It's light bodied on the palate yet firmly structured with tannins, offering red plum fruit and peppery spice. Refreshing and elegant.
Using fruit sourced from 94-year-old vines, this is a powerful and concentrated wine. It has a serious, complex mix of fruit and tannin, with notes of leather and spice that lend power and density. Age this for at least another year.
Lacryma Christi is a rustic and savory red wine, with bright tones of dried currant, spice, tobacco and leather. It includes touches of cured meat and bresaola, and the finish is sour and fresh.
This is a classic Zinfandel, scented with wild sage and forest berries, and full of raspberry, strawberry and black-cherry flavors. It's full bodied and well balanced, but generous and soft in texture, while mild tannins help carry the flavors through a lingering finish.
Modeled on a Right Bank, Bordeaux-style blend, this is 75% Merlot. It's supple and fruity, with ripe, balanced tannins. The wine does not have as much weight and depth as many Red Mountain reds, but it's well-balanced and suitable for drinking over the next few years.
Gets better the longer it's open, but starts with perfumed aromas of bright berry fruit and mineral. The palate is true and balanced, with spicy red-berry flavors and a hint of fine herbal essence. Dry and composed, but always an easygoing, fruity, sturdy wine that should age well through 2012–2014.
A rich, chocolaty Cabernet, sweet in glycerine, blackberry jam and toast flavors, brushed with spices. Good tannins and acids, but it's a bit on the sweet side.
This Krug vintage is showing some maturity, especially from its toast aroma. But certainly not too much maturity, because on the palate the fruit remains young at heart, a crisp burst of freshness coming through the more mature acidity. All the elements are in balance, making a finely shaped wine, which impresses as much from its elegance as from its richness.
A little sweet and acidic, this blend of all five Bordeaux varieties has candy-like flavors of cherries, blackberries, raspberries and anise biscotti. Drink now.
Too acidic and tart in wintergreen flavors, a real disappointment from this well-regarded vineyard. On the plus side, it's bone dry and silky, and shows cherry and cola flavors accented with sweet, smoky oak. Ready to drink now.
Thin and tight, this high-acid Syrah is stubbornly closed. It's difficult to predict when—or if—it will open up. Right now, it doesn't show much beyond acid and stem.
This leads with slightly honeyed notes of peach, melon and pear. Flavors of grilled apple skin, peach pit and beeswax unfold on the palate, finishing somewhat warm and toasty. Drink up.
The winery is better known for Pinot Noir, but now turns to Chardonnay, with good results. The little-known appellation is in the middle of the warm-cool Sonoma spectrum, and the wine shows ripe orange, pear and pineapple flavors, brightened with crisp acidity.
Here's a distinctive nose for a Chianti Classico: coffee, leather, Indian spice, beef broth, wet earth and an unexpected hint of bay leaf. In the mouth, this is a chewy wine with tart blueberry flavors and a nice quality of tannins.
There's a honeyed, mead-like character on the nose of this Steve Clifton wine. It also shows buttered brioche, lemon curds and an underlying white rock minerality. Ruby-red grapefruit flesh and ripe nectarine flavors arrive once sipped, and a chalky grip ensues, making for a very dynamic and intriguing wine.
Norman Conquest, get it? The wine itself is too soft, and lacks the tannin-acid structure needed for balance. Too bad, because the oak-infused cherry and blackberry flavors are fine.
Light and bright, this wine is fruity with a soft, smooth texture that brings out pear and green-plum flavors. A refreshing wine, it's tangy, zesty and ready to drink.
The 2006 Pertimali tastes better than the 2006 Riserva and the 2007 Brunello. This wine is uniquely characterized by bold freshness and richness showing the clean and precise quality of Sangiovese fruit. The aftertaste is long, spicy and firm. Give this wine 5–10 more years.
Restrained and soft on the nose, this light-bodied white offers subtle lemon zestiness and a phenolic seam that provide structure and food-friendliness with a savory, almost herbal edge.
Made from Clarksburg grapes, a small appellation near Lodi, this soft Merlot tastes a touch metallic and its blackberry and cherry notes finish a tad bitter.
The Accordini family is ripe with excellent winemakers and this young Amarone showcases their expertise. What it lacks in overt intensity it makes up for with elegance and tonic aromas of small fruit berries, polished stone, bramble and smoke. Tight and clean in structure, there's a nice wholeness to this wine.
Dark berry aromas, chocolate and grit define the nose on this blend of Syrah, Cabernet and Tempranillo. The palate feels ripe and fresh, but the tannins are hard and grabby. Black plum flavors are bold and offer notes of spice, herbs and earthiness. This is composed on the finish despite a reprise of hard smacking tannins.
This unoaked white offers rounded tropical fruit aromas and flavors like pineapple, melon and pear. The style is straightforward and exuberant, with balanced acidity and a fruity, lush finish. Keep on the table for everyday enjoyment.

Lush and creamy in texture and showing a bit of warmth, this is a mouthfilling, crowd-pleasing blend of Grenache, Shiraz and Mataro (Mourvèdre). Ripe currant fruit is nicely framed by hints of vanilla and cedar. Drink now–2015.
This blend of Syrah and several other Rhône varieties is easy to like for its full-bodied flavors of currants, leather and spices. With its grippy tannins, this will pair well with ribs, burgers and tacos.
Black fruits are wreathed in subtle notes of earth, smoke and graphite. This is a palate-pleasing wine, but seems a little too safe, lacking the complexity and northern Rhône accents that Washington Syrahs often show.
Aromas of violet, forest floor, ripe berry and a whiff of new leather emerge on this structured red. The ripe, full-bodied palate delivers mouthfuls of juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry, licorice, menthol and white pepper set against a backbone of assertive but velvety-textured tannins. Drink through 2018– 2026.

From one of the producer's older vineyard sites, fully mature and steady, this wine shines in cranberry, rhubarb and strawberry before finding richer, riper streaks of blueberry and blackberry. Generous tannin is seasoned by layers of piquant cinnamon and vanilla. It's lush and bold.
Delicious. Although it's packed with tropical fruit and vanilla honey flavors, the finish is thoroughly dry, and an undergirding of minerals accentuates the crispness. Only 91 cases produced.
This is an aromatic, flowery wine, fresh on the palate and delicious with strawberry and apricot flavors. Some spice goes with the fruitiness and fresh, tight aftertaste.

Bergström's lineup of Pinot Noir begins where many other wineries finish. This complex, earthy wine shows its fair share of herb and even a hint of stem, but those are offset by crisp, well-defined flavors of cranberry, cherry and spice. A fine example of this winery's house style.
This rough and rowdy combo of 38% Syrah, 35% Grenache, 19% Mourvèdre and 8% Petite Sirah is rough around the edges in ramshackle savory dirt flavor yet nicely smoothed over in juicy blue and black fruit, meaty tannin and an expertly concocted peppery finish.

Winemaker: Carl van der Merwe. A blend of 78% Grenache, 18% Syrah, 2% Mourvèdre and 2% Durif, this opens with a pronounced purple-floral character that rides atop a core of black raspberry, boysenberry and cherry fruit. Hints of toasted spice and tree bark add depth and interest, while smooth but present tannins lend structure to the medium-weight mouthfeel. A pleasant hit of smoky campfire lingers on the finish. Drink now–2021.
Wines from Morey-Saint-Denis should be opulent in 2005, and this wine has opulence in spades. It fills the mouth with rich red plums, red cherries and some cranberry juice to give an edge of dryness. Maybe complexity is edged out by all this juicy fruit, but the tannins do firm up the wine, which should certainly age 10 years or more.
Lime and passion fruit aromas are subtle and appealing. This delivers a fresh, alert palate and crisp, lightly brined flavors of lettuce, apple and cucumber. On the finish, it runs peppery but not overly aggressive.
Fruity in blackberry and cherry flavors, this is easy to drink, with a good acid-tannin balance.
You need to think ahead here, because this wine is currently totally dominated by wood. The richness and classic, balanced structure that is normal with Haut-Bailly seems to have been put aside in favor of a highly polished, toast-laden style. Search for the fruit and there is blackberry,spice and fruit tannin. But it's hard. Wait 10 years at least.
Broad and ripe, this wine offers hints of lemon curd, crushed stone and cashew butter. Ripe melon fruit flavors dominate the palate, even suggesting honey at times, while anise notes provide a bit of lift on the finish. Drink now.

Red in color and pretty clean on the nose, where raspberry and rose petal essence come together. The palate is acidic and tight, with tangy watermelon and peach flavors carrying the cleansing finish. Juicy to the extreme, but a good partner for food.
This is a ull, rich wood-aged Muscadet from old vines in a single vineyard. It is ripe, yellow fruit flavored and concentrated, the natural acidity of the Melon grape rounded and softened. It can be aged so drink now through 2017.
There is a racy, spicy, biting edge to this young Pinot that nicely expresses the Chehalem Mountains AVA terroir, authoritative and unapologetic for the herbal side of the grape. It lingers and opens into a mélange of red fruits, forest, leaf and loam, still stiff and compact after hours of breathing.
Aromas and flavors of dark cherry, earth, and leather; lots of toast, too. This is full-stride Pinot made from fine materials, and the mouthfeel is very polished and balanced. Finishes long, with cherry flavors and a complex chalky note. Supple and sophisticated Oregon Pinot Noir.
A note of dried citrus peel adds a touch of spice to the whiff of petrol on this delicate, minerally Riesling. The palate is zippy and brisk, with loads of fresh stone-fruit flavor and a long, steely finish that reverberates.
High in acidity, this wine seems unbalanced. The fruit is distinct from the structure, leaving crispness contrasted with firm tannins.
Frankly sweet, tasting like a sugared fruit juice blend of tangerines, pineapples and mangoes. Still, it's clean and streamlined in acidity.

Another winner from Emilio Moro. The nose is a touch minty and very spicy, but the black fruit element is there and overall the bouquet sings of integration. Pure, enthralling and big, with monster black fruit flavors, complexity, rich oak and a long, smooth finish. Stylish yet powerful; drink from 2013 through 2020.
From Domaine St. George, a polished, ripe wine, from a premier growing region. It's dry and a little rough in texture, with complex flavors of dried cherries and blackberries, and a cleansing espresso bitterness to the finish.
A little peach, a little cantaloupe and plenty of rich character courtesy of the Pinot Nero. A nice cocktail-party wine with significant substance. It rolls on the tongue and leaves a clean and precise palate feel. Sweetness is not a problem here; it barely shows any toast or yeast. It’s cool and collected Italian bubbly.
A Garrafeira wine is a special selection and this wine, which was aged for 30 months after bottling before being released, shows its quality quickly. Now reaching drinkability, its tannins have softened leaving rich full black currant and fresh acidity along with a more mature leathery character. Drink now and until 2020.
This is the first vintage made by the vineyard owners in 25 years, a welcome return for one of the founding families of Oregon viticulture. Strawberries and raspberries, tart and spicy, anchor an elegant and interesting young wine. The finish continues clean and well-defined. Don't look for a blockbuster style; rather it's more delicate and refined.
A fragrant, sherbety cloud of spring meadow and lemon hovers above the glass. Grassy freshness frames the bright, pure lemon notions that dominate nose and palate. This wine is utterly fresh, citric and brisk. The mouthfeel is taut and slender, with only the slightest edge of autolytic notes and a structure of freshness and purity. It almost has a cleansing quality on its superbright, clean finish.
Ripe, smooth, velvet textured wine, layering dark chocolate, black plum skins, dense tannins and a big, solid structure. It tastes powerful from the ripe tannins and big fruit, finishing with fresh acidity.
Violets, leather, vanilla, subtle oak and black berry sensations all meld together in the glass. The rich, concentrated palate delivers ripe black cherry and blueberry extract accented by mocha, cinnamon, clove, white pepper and mineral. It's soft and already extremely accessible, with velvety tannins, but will age well for the next five years or so. Drink now through 2019.
Slightly sour black fruit meets charcoal and hints of pyrazine on the nose of this blended red. Dried blueberry combines with loamy earth on the palate.
Cherries, leather and earth all mingle on the nose and palate of this medium-bodied wine. It's a pleasant, easy-to-drink offering, even if it's not terribly concentrated or complex. Drink now.
This opens with French oak, vanilla, toast and coconut aromas. The oak-derived qualities carry over to palate, along with sour cherry, raspberry compote and espresso flavors while tight, close-grained tannins grip the finish.
With 12 months wood aging, this powerful wine has managed to keep a great sense of balance. Solid tannins are tempered by a more dusty texture, smooth black plum fruits, rich, concentrated acidity and juicy final fruitiness. Drink from 2018.
Violet petal, fine leather, roasted berry and spice aromas are classy and elevated. This is a deep, generous, modern Rioja with tons of ripeness but also ideal balance. Black-fruit flavors spread from cheek to cheek, while toast, bitter chocolate and espresso notes add complexity. This beauty finishes stout, with toast, mint, chocolate and herb flavors. Drink from 2015 through 2025.
Oak aging gives richness to this red Vinho Verde; its spice and acidity balanced with its red currant flavor and some weight from the tannins. It's an intriguing hybrid, halfway between a crisp Vinho Verde and a full-bodied warm-climate red.
Smooth, silky and suggestively redolent of banana, yellow fruit and white stone. There's a unique roundness or velvetiness to this wine, but also fruity freshness and playful youthfulness. Very food friendly. Imported by Palm Bay Imports.
This rich, oaky Chardonnay has aromas and flavors of buttered toast, buttered popcorn, vanilla and pineapple jam. It's very rich and creamy, and appeals for sheer deliciouness.
This wine seems disjointed from the initial aromas through the finish. Its perfume, lemon polish and other mismatched components don't indicate any improvement ahead.

Produced from organic grapes from the plateau above the prestigious slopes of Chablis, this is a cool and fresh wine with plenty of citrus as well as acidity. Drink now.
Made from low-yielding, 70-year-old vines, this is a dense wine with an almost-dark structure and ripe red-plum flavors. Powerful, it obviously will be better with food and could even benefit from decanting before drinking. Age this concentrated wine until late 2016.
This is a pretty simple Petite Sirah, with rich, soft flavors of raspberry and cherry sour candy. But it has lovely tannins. Cook up a great cheeseburger and enjoy.
This yellow-colored blend is weird and wooly, with aromas of blowsy apricot and herbs. A pulpy, melony palate is creamy and odd in feel, with nectarine and chunky peach flavors that turn rubbery on the finish.
Leafy underbrush, leather, truffle, grilled herb and tilled soil aromas lead the way. The dense, forward palate doles out juicy black cherry, star anise, tobacco and an earthy hint of game while velvety tannins give it a smooth, polished texture. It has immediate appeal and will offer fine drinking for the next few years. Drink through 2020.
Shows lots of dryness and austerity, with acidity, minerals and herbs accompanying the citrus and oak flavors. Not a flamboyant Chardonnay, but a controlled one that offers complexity. A good companion to fresh crab, with buttery garlic bread.
With spicy orange, pineapple, candied ginger and honeysuckle flower flavors, this is a tasty Gewürz. It's not officially sweet, but so soft in acidity that the slight residual sugar is magnified, making it taste almost off-dry.
Neutral smelling other than a hint of peach and vanilla on the bouquet. Comes across a bit heavy and warm, but not too much so. Flavors of soft melon are appealing, and the finish is fleshy. Drink now before it loses its spunk.
Smells raisiny, feels hot, tastes overripe.
Broadly fruity, this dark and smooth Merlot is loaded with a luscious mix of black fruits. The flavors play out in forward, accessible fashion, flecked with a pleasing minerality.
Made from grapes sourced from a biodynamically farmed vineyard, this wine puts on an almost-magical display of flower and citrus scents. Deep and concentrated, this has harmonious and potent flavors, and it is amazing how the delicate floral aspect cuts across the juicy, citrusy taste.
With this wine, Venge has taken a giant leap into the front ranks of California Syrah producers. It's made from fruit that's sourced from the great Stagecoach Vineyard, which straddles Atlas Peak—a cool mountain region.

Dramatic and high in alcohol, this selection is gorgeous to drink now, and it will remain fresh over the next six years.
Made with Sangiovese and 5% Colorino, this wine has aromas of ripe berries, blue flower and incense. The one-dimensional but juicy palate delivers black cherry accented with notes of white pepper and espresso alongside chewy tannins.
Smoke and crushed stone notes add a savory, earthy element to sweet, honeyed tangerine and apricot flavors on this bright, brisk, remarkably complex Riesling. It's delicately structured but penetrating in style with a long, focused finish.
All the wines in the Abadal line seem commited to serious aromas and flavors supported by honest structure. This Merlot from an obscure Catalonian wine region offers blackberry, cigar box and raisin aromas in front of additional blackberry flavor. There's also chocolate folded into the finishing layers. Integrated and properlly welded by firm tannins.
Baked, raisiny aromas indicate a very ripe wine. This feels full and heavy on the tongue, with dark, toasty flavors that turn bitter, oaky and peppery on the finish.
Crisp, fresh and firm, this opens with steely effervescence and etched notes of flint, white pepper and delicate spring flower. The finish is dry and bright.

This racy and leesy young wine offers fresh and crisp flavors of cucumber, celery, jicama and green apple. Despite all the green components, it is not herbal or vegetal, and offers a precise, delicately crafted and ageworthy take on the grape.
This is a workmanlike Cabernet that gets the job done. Standard berry aromas show a spot of oak. Solid but highly regular cherry, cassis and chocolaty flavors finish with a smear of superficial oak.
Cloudy Bay is better known for its Sauvignon Blanc, but their Chardonnay is dependably good as well. This vintage seems a little lighter than previous efforts, but it still offers flavorful notes of cashew butter atop a base of pineapple and lemon fruit. Imported by Moët Hennessy USA.

Truly classy, with a deep nose of earth, tar and pure berry fruit. This wine delivers both the sweetness and ripeness that it should along with some rugged, spicy edges. The finish is big and packed with licorice, spice and pepper. A fine wine. Hold until 2006.
Full bodied and firmly tannic, this bold wine has lots of berry and cherry flavors, tangy acidity and plenty of tannin, too. It tastes dry, almost tart, and leaves an astringent effect on the finish, so it needs to pair with rich fatty foods that balance it out.
Judged against more familiar varietal wines, this Maturana comes across as unusual, but not bad. Herbal aromas of juniper and briny berry are typical for the grape. Flavors of stewed blueberry, juniper and herbs are naturally green-leaning and a bit odd. This is something to explore.
The aromas of cocoa and dark raspberry are speckled with light barrel accents. The red-fruit flavors are ripe and generous, dipping in the middle before coming back together on the elegant finish.
Sporting a big burst of juicy cranberry fruit, this young wine, one of the first Pinots to be released from the 2014 vintage, is easy to like. There's nothing too fussy here, just tangy red fruit set against balanced acids and light tannins.

The nose is forceful and strong, with char and the dark-fruit aromas that Shiraz and Malbec are known for. The palate pops along, propelled by healthy acids and moderate tannins. And the finish is fairly plush before it fades away quietly. A little more depth and length and we'd really be singing this wine's praises. As is, it's a rock-solid blend.
This bright white offers aromas of lime, pineapple and citrus blossom. The fresh palate delivers juicy lemon, apple and a hint of nut alongside tangy acidity while a saline note closes finish.
The Volcanic Hill section of Diamond Creek's vineyard on Diamond Mountain is, as advertised, influenced by volcanic soils. The wine imparts a chalky consistency to some extent, rounded out by dark, ripe plum and mocha, with a long, intense finish. Age through 2025.
A concentrated Pinot with layers of lavender, violet and strawberry compote, the medium weight of this wine has a ripe cherry note throughout. It might mellow with age, and it's a good representation of Anderson Valley's fine 2009 vintage.

Here the deep, dark cassis fruit flavors are accented with ground coffee, moist earth, and buttery barrel flavors. A fine effort that captures the varietal character and smooches it with great barrel management. The blend includes 10% Merlot and 5% Cabernet Sauvignon. An elegant, deceptive wine, it needs your attention as it shows itself gently.
Prieto Picudo is the grape, and the wine yields robust aromas of radish and red fruits. Very tangy, almost citrusy on the palate. Finishes quite lean and tart. A screechy wine without a lot of happiness.
Venturing into the orange side of the rosé color rainbow, this Mourvèdre-based wine—with 13% Grenache—brings melon, guava, pomelo and ripening banana to the nose, followed by papaya and watermelon once sipped. It's a revealing look at the potential of the overlooked Central Coast vineyards that winemaker Ian Brand diligently seeks out, both for his personal labels and the many for which he consults.
Very oaky, with coconut and raw wood making up the bulk of the bouquet. Wood is the recurring theme throughout, with just a bit of dark fruit making an appearance. Very hard, tannic and tough.
This outstanding Chardonnay shows the brilliant structural purity of both the cold vintage and the terroir of the far Sonoma Coast. While the wine isn't in the same league as Flowers's spectacular Moon Select Chardonnay, it's not as expensive and still deeply satisfying. It's acid-driven with flavors of Meyer lemon, but balanced with notes of tropical fruit, butter and honey.
Lisini delivers an extremely satisfying Brunello that is richly redolent of black fruit, plum, cola, root beer, leather and pipe tobacco. It feels vibrant and fresh in the mouth with well- integrated acidity against firm tannins. Pair this pretty wine with grilled meats.
Really youthful, with almost grapy aromas buttressed by mocha and lifted, slightly leafy notes. This is a big wine, marked by thick, chewy tannins on the finish, but they never obscure the flavors of grape skins, tapenade and mocha. Try after 2018.
The Daou brothers break a bit from their polished house style to dive into gamy wonders in this blend of 80% Petite Sirah, 12% Tannat and 8% Tempranillo, with a nose that shows burned tire, bacon fat, underripe plums and freshly paved street. Crushed black pepper, charred beef and animal-hide funkiness converge on the palate. It's a great counterpoint to the winery's usual suavity.
Eight grapes comprise this weird, peanutty, almost dirty red blend. The nose is like a salad of bitter greens and peanut vinaigrette, and the palate shows big fruit, bigger tannins and then a finish of asparagus and green beans. Imported by USA Wines Inc.
Pointy and sharp at first, with earthy, dry aromas. Edgy feeling, with heat and scour to go with peppery, herbal berry flavors. Finishes mossy and warm, with a minty burn. Improves with airing.
This is a simple, jammy wine, with fresh black cherry and cola flavors, highlighted with acidity. Made from Merlot, Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, it's an approachable everyday sipper at an accessible price.
The wine is mature both in its orange-pink color and toasty flavors. It has fresh acidity, although that is less important than the almond and spice secondary flavors. Ripe and full in the mouth, this is a rich rosé with a soft, ready-to-drink aftertaste.
87-89. Barrel sample. Concentrated, with bitter fruit and wood characters, this wine feels hard and extracted, with a burnt finish.
Give this wine until 2020 in the cellar to let all the parts begin to come together. Tasted in March, it's all about tannins, unintegrated oak and fresh, ripe raspberry jam fruit. There's a good wine in there somewhere but it's hiding right now.
Consistent with the 2014 Confero, this blends multiple clones from five different vineyards. Its details are sharp, framing taut red fruit with a vein of licorice before resolving into dusty tannins. It delivers excellent length, muscle and definition.
Aromas of smoked meat, mesquite, green olive and tire rubber meld with barrel spice accents. It's soft and supple in feel with abundant savory flavors—an interesting wine that has some edge.
The good 2006 vintage has produced this well-balanced wine that is now showing delicious signs of maturity. The initial fruit has gone, replaced by toast, spice and grilled almonds. At the same time, the acidity and taut mineral texture are still in play, giving a wine that is lively and just ready to drink now.
Domaine Drouhin's reserve-level Chardonnay puts new oak flavors front and center but backs them up with ultraripe fruit. A lush mix of tangerine, melon and peach notes combine, expanding across the palate. It's drinking quite well already but should continue improve through 2024.
93-95 Barrel sample. Certainly on the dry side, the wine is very rich, hard edged in its spiciness, with quite a bite of ginger. The acidity, though, is very much in balance, offering a wonderful crispness at the core of all the sweetness.
Tastes a little sweet, which may be from the extremely high (15.4%) alcohol. There's a soft, sugary mouthfeel to the pie-filling cherry and oak flavors. Firm tannins round out the picture. Not an ager.
Boasts a reasonably complex bouquet of chocolate, cedar and weedy cassis, followed by a mellow, soft palate impression. The fruit is sweet and direct, just the kind of thing that would hit the spot with an impromptu meal of steak frites. No, there's not a lot of structure, but why age a wine that's so clearly made for immediate gratification?
Aromas of baked plum, new leather and pipe tobacco emerge in the glass. The big muscular palate offers fleshy black cherry, prune steeped in spirits, licorice and vanilla alongside the heat of evident alcohol. Firm velvety tannins provide the framework.
Rich and perfumed, this is a rotund and smooth wine. It has light spice, followed by ripe flavors of tropical fruit and almond, with a crisp layer of acidity. The finish has a full mouthfeel, with a spice note.
From a magical place in the heart of Sonoma Valley, near several marquee spots for Zin, this estate-grown brawler is high-octane, yet drinkable, a yeasty, brambly expression of tar, leather, meat and black licorice. Only the second vintage from the producer, the wine's weight doesn't overpower its potential, which should develop further in time.
Cream and grapefruit aromas lead to flavors of more grapefruit, citrus and spice. Light and creamy in the mouth, with a touch of oak, this wine is finely crafted, finishing lively.
With wood and black currant aromas, this is a soft, ripe and ready to drink wine. It has a rich texture, with a smokiness and black fruits that are smoothed by wood and lifted by acidity.
The combination of high alcohol and what tastes like residual sugar makes this Zinfandel rather sugary sweet. If that's your style, you'll like the jammy raspberries, cherries and spices.
Made using selections of the best parcels from Jaubertie, this is a complex and structured wine. Mint and new wood flavors are still dominant, although the fruit shows its black fruit richness. Age for over four years.
This is a ripe, creamy blend of Arinto, Viognier and Verdelho. A lightly perfumed character as well as a crisp texture. Yellow fruit and bright acidity are in fine balance. Drink now.
Already showing hints of brown at the rim and the beginnings of decay on the nose, this is still eminently drinkable, especially if you prefer a little age on your Port. It's supple in the mouth, with flavors of spice and brown sugar, finishing with a hint of licorice.
Lovely natural acidity keeps this sweet wine light on its feet, underscoring the honeyed pear fruit flavors with grapefruit and a hint of minerality. For a wine in this price range, with 11,000 case production levels, it's a marvelous achievement.
The addition of 28% Grenache brings a punchy, upfront fruitiness to the umami-soaked Syrah. Tangy orange/raspberry fruit is concentrated and fills the mouth; then the peppery, earthy Syrah backbone brings flesh to the finish. Beautifully proportioned.
Wonderful as usual, this stellar Chenin Blanc, from 30-year-old old vines at two different Yakima valley sites, is dense, ripe and complex—words you rarely see associated with reviews of domestic Chenin Blanc. A riot of melon, citrus and peach, with juicy acidity and refreshing minerality.
Aromas of white spring flowers and ripe pear lead the way on this vibrant sparkler. The lively palate delivers crunchy green apple and citrus zest alongside persistent bubbles and bright acidity.
Dry and tannic, this 100% Cab has flavors of herbs, blackberries and tea. It's a tough wine not showing generosity now. You can age for a couple years, but the tannins will outlast the fruit.
Tight aromas of citrus and red fruits aren't expressive but at least they're crisp. Same goes for the palate, which is tight and juicy as it offers flavors of pink grapefruit, citrus and burnt grass/hay. Good as value-priced quaffers go.
From vines planted in the 1960s, and given time in 100% French oak, this dry, unctuous wine is tropical in character. A mix of pineapple and nutmeg teases its way into notes of canned corn.
Made from Nebbiolo aged in large casks, this garnet-colored wine offers lovely fragrances of rose petal and woodland berry. The elegant palate doles out crunchy red cherry, crushed raspberry, clove and mineral, alongside smooth, polished tannins. Fresh acidity adds vibrancy. Drink through 2019.
This full and smoothly soft wine blended with 10% Petite Sirah, 7% Malbec and 3% Petit Verdot is aged in American oak, a quarter of it new. It pleases in bright red currant, cassis and wisps of blackberry, both approachable and sophisticated. Velvety black licorice meets smoky campfire on the finish.
Raisin and white pepper aromas, ripe fruit, floral and spicy anise flavors and full body add up to a big wine in which the whole-cluster fermentation method can be tasted. The hearty flavors, complexity and firm tannins paint a unique picture, and this bottling makes a dramatic contrast in style from the “regular” Anderson Valley Pinot Noir.
A crisp, dry wine, very fresh, dominated by grapefruit and lemon flavors, with a light texture of green fruit skins. This is as fresh as can be, but it has a good density of flavor to balance.
Delivers rather standard Chardonnay aromas and flavors, ranging from hints of toast to ripe peaches and pineapple. It's nicely balanced, showing some lush texture on the midpalate yet retaining citrusy freshness on the finish. Well done, and well priced. Drink now.
Fine, new wood flavors mingle with acidity and ripe blackberry fruits to give a balanced wine. It has a fine texture, spice and juicy acidity that brings out the fruit of the vintage. It will be ready to drink soon, certainly by 2017.
If you don't like the burn of high alcohol, avoid this wine. At 15.6%, it's almost like Port. On the other hand, it's a tasty Zin, chockful of lush cassis, milk chocolate, macaroon and vanilla fudge flavors, and is entirely dry.
Whiffs of baby powder and blossoms lend a floral, perfumed tone to this pretty Gewürztraminer. It's bold in body and alcohol, but the palate stays bright thanks to fresh grapefruit and tangerine flavors.
In a tasting of its 2004 Rutherford peers, this wine did not stand out particularly well. It smelled and tasted porty sweet, with charry oak and syrupy flavors of cherry and blackberry jam.
Tight aromas of cherry and cassis come with orange peel and licorice scents. It feels edgy and acidic on the palate, but there's enough body and fruit to absorb the acids.

Fresh and light, with acidity, citrus and grapefruit flavors plus a touch of pear.
A fine Zin, rich and sweet in raspberries and cherries, with spicy notes of cinnamon, pepper and Chinese Five-spice. It's a lusty, delicious wine for drinking now with beef, pork, chicken or even a veggie lasagna.
Opening notes include vanilla, oak and black fruit. The palate offers black cherry, licorice and espresso along with spice notes. It shows the heat of the vintage and is already evolved.

This Bordeaux-Rhône blend is rustic and dry, with significant tannins. It has earthy, herb, berry and spice flavors that finish with a touch of bitterness.
Dark, smoky and charred on the nose, with herbal black fruit sitting under that. Call it a saturated cheek-grabber with rubbery tannins and sweet flavors of plum and blackberry. Shows coffee and toast in front of herbal, salty finishing notes.

Melon and apple aromas are simple. This has a soft, melony mouthfeel and flavors of tropical fruits and honeydew. The finish is chubby, sweet-tasting and tropical-leaning.
Very refined, with lovely perfume. Heady, showing currants, cassis, cedar, chocolate-covered cherries and sweet herbs. Decadent, classy, elegant, with a great tannin structure. Just oozes class.
Talk about an assorted but attractive bouquet: this has lemon, peach, dried herbs—even some honey. The flavors veer mostly toward citrus—predominantly lemon and orange. But there's a touch of sweet pineapple in there, too. The finish is spicy and maintains the citrus from the palate, but it does tail off a bit heavy and hot.
Lighter in color, this wine comes from the Miller family that owns Bien Nacido Vineyard. Aromas combine brisk raspberry and fresh strawberry with clove. There is a bitterness on the palate akin to sautéed beet greens, followed by pepper spice and more raspberry, with tannins that may evolve over time.

It's supported by a core of ripe red-cherry and -berry fruit tones, and framed by medium tannins and moderate acidity that lends a crushed satin texture. Notes of incense, cocoa powder and sweet spice unfold on the satisfying finish. Drink now–2021.
T-L has three cuvées of Châteauneuf, and while this is the least expensive, it's also the most enjoyable now. A hint of sweaty horse blanket may put off some tasters, but this full-bodied, lushly textured wine features ample raspberry and cherry flavors, copious spices and a long, softly dusty finish. Drink it over the next 5–8 years.
A blend of Marsanne, Grenache Blanc, Roussanne and Viognier. It's bone dry and zesty in acidity, showing an austerity of flavor that emphasizes minerals over fruit. There's enough Meyer lemon and lime zest to satisfy. Sleek and elegant.
Remarkably inky in color for a Grenache-based blend, it features strong aromas of cedar, meat and deeply purple fruit. The soft, rich mouthfeel coats the palate like a luxurious lacquer, and features flavors of blackberry jam, macerated cherry and vanilla-spiced plums.

This has all the Riesling basics: crushed-stone and lime aromas, citrus zest and melon rind flavors and a zippy, fresh finish. There's an almost crystalline quality to this wine's fruit, a slightly hard, teutonic edge that snaps the taster to attention rather than seducing with charm.

Plump and voluminous on the palate, this full-bodied wine is marked by swirls of caramel, orange and peach flavors. It's a bit plush in feel but accents of spice and smoked lend nuance.
Intensely sweet, as you might expect, with scents of honey, dried apricots and clover. But there's also a hint of vinyl or plastic that mars the nose and the palate, so although this is sticky and long on the finish, it doesn't quite make top marks.
This wine has rich blueberry aromas, a softly tannic texture and and black currant flavors that open more with each sip. Concentrated and full in body, it's a luxurious-feeling and abundantly flavored wine that lingers long on the palate.
The wine is closed, but has potential. At the moment, the wood and texture dominate, but there are signs of ripe apple and pear fruits that will come through in a few months. Wait until the end of 2014.
This has a relatively high dosage, producing a ripe strawberry flavor. It's full bodied, touched by a spice note, as well as some toast from bottle age. The finish shows that this is a rosé fit for food.

Very buttery aromas lead to a wine that is ripe, rounded and full in the mouth. The acidity is masked by the richness, leaving apricot rather than citrus as the dominant character.
This inky red-violet wine has a nose of blueberry pie, green pepper and violet. It is slightly tart at first sip, with tannins that hide at first and then coat the tongue and gums. A rich flavor profile of blackberry, cranberry, anise, violet and white chocolate makes way for cherry and chocolate notes in the finish.
This is hard-hitting, rumble-ready Rioja with raw, minty aromas coming in front of a packed, drying palate. Powerful berry flavors finish with a peppery flavor, rubbery notes and sharpness. This may improve some over the next two years.

The palate offers wild cherry layered with medicinal herb, black pepper and grilled sage supported by firm tannins. It's still young and a bit disjointed so give it time to come together. Drink after 2018.

The winery calls this a Super-Tuscan blend, a bit of a stretch with 33% Carmenère along with 57% Sangiovese and 5% each Syrah and Malbec. There is a strong streak of green bean that goes so far as to hint at asparagus and drying tannins through an earthy finish.

A beautiful wine, dry, complex and crisp, and easily one of the best white Rhône-style bottlings of the vintage. It shows brilliantly clean acidity that provides a brisk mouthfeel to the apricot, pineapple and pear flavors that rest on a firm ground of minerals. Great as a richer, more exotic alternative to Sauvignon Blanc.
Pungent, grassy and ultrafresh, with citric aromas and textbook scents of wild grass, nettles and passionfruit. The palate is similar, with passionfruit, green melon and citrus front and center.

Drink now.
Delicious, sweet scents of perfectly ripe berries rise up from the glass, and it would be easy to say it's just a big old bowl of raspberry fruit.

This is a serious, complex wine from an estate that was created in the 1930s. Old vines and wood aging have give the wine concentration and richness. Black-plum skin and blackberry flavors, enhanced by a good proportion of Petit Verdot, dominate a wine that will age well. Drink from 2022.

A blend of Merlot, Cab Sauvignon and Blauer Zweigelt, aged for 2 years in wood. The wood only underlines the richness of the black plum, bitter cherry and cocoa flavors. It is elegant, understated, wearing its power well. Age for 5–6 years.
Black fruit, chocolate, licorice and menthol aromas take center stage in this brawny, forward Brunello.

With Carmenère and País in the blend along with Carignan, this shows a lot of “old country” character, namely a saucy, savory nose with herbal red-berry hints. Herbal plum and peppery flavors fade on an undistinguished finish.
Lacks a bit of intensity, both in terms of aroma and flavor, but this is a nice, easy-drinking Chardonnay that won't overwhelm whatever you choose to serve alongside. Vanilla and caramel notes support peach and melon fruit.
While tinged with savory complexities of wet earth, spice and game, this densely structured Cabernet Franc is anchored by a core of ripe blackberry and black cherry flavors. Zesty acidity and firm, fine-grained tannins lend a tightness of structure that should hold up well through 2025.
A selection from a single plot of 40- to 70-year-old vines, this full-bodied wine is juicy with a tight texture that comes from the terroir. It offers a crisp edge as well as bright acidity, the apple fruits lifted further by a lemon streak. Drink from 2019.
A bit more than half Merlot, this Bordeaux-style blend is balanced and complex. Layers of flower, fruit and earth unfold gracefully. There are suggestions of clean mushroom as well, with a smooth, seamless mouthfeel and modest length.
Plastic, rubber and latex aromas dominate the nose on this Carmenère. Tomatoey, cloying and tannic in the mouth, the palate tastes mostly of carob, oak and herbal berry fruits.
A light golden hue, this richly aromatic wine offers notes of toasty barrel spices, apricot and dried mango. It's full bodied, almost unctuous in feel, with abundant, sweet stone-fruit flavors and a lingering finish.
Good price for a Napa Merlot of this quality. It's not a big, ageable wine, but shows plenty of fleshy pleasure now, with a rich array of plums, cassis and raspberries, and smoky char influences of oak. Merryvale packed a lot of elegant sophistication into this wine.
Now owned by Guy Saget of Pouilly-sur-Loire, Balland-Chapuis is an historic name in Sancerre. This is typical of their classic production, fresh, straightforward, with fine, fresh citrus and gooseberry fruits and a fine, ripe structure. Imported by Serge Dore Selections.
Good but not excessively expressive on the bouquet, this reveals a milk chocolate element that emerges after the wine airs. The flavor profile starts with a lemony oak note, with notes of blackberry, herb and peppery spice underneath. The nice finish is modest, like the bouquet. Only 300 cases made.
This is a unique expression of Gavi (from the far-away 2000 vintage) that shows the extraordinary aging potential of this lively white wine. The elegance is all in the aging. Stone fruit and floral notes are enhanced by white mineral, smoky ash and dried lemon zest. The wine is fresh and crisp with a sour almond note on the close. This wine won't appeal to everyone.
It's hard to imagine naturally tannic Sagrantino as a dessert wine but indeed this native Umbrian red grape was traditionally made in a sweet style to soften its firm astringency. Deeply red and richly concentrated, it shows chocolate, savory spice and blackberry. Drying tannins keep the palate clean.
On the verge of their 100th anniversary as a vintners, the Riboli family ups their luxury game with this serious and structured blend of 47% Cabernet Sauvignon, 21% Merlot, 16% Malbec, 11% Petit Verdot and 5% Cabernet Franc.

Drink 2018–2033.
Six barrels—one each from six vineyards—comprise this cuvée. It's soft and silky, with pretty cherry fruit and a touch of herb. The finish continues smooth and supple, with a suggestion of caramel.
Lively right off the bat but also sort of jumbled and cheesy. The palate features red-fruit flavors and candy, while the finish is aggressively racy and a bit raw. A natural, expressive wine but one that's grabby and edgy as well. Needs both time in the glass and food to show best.
The wine is fresh, aromatic and so crisp. Made from Fernão Pires and Verdelho, it is ripe with apple flavors and tangy with orange zest. The wine is young, fruity and ready to drink.
This wine is hard, piercing and pushy on the nose, with a chemical note. A rubbery, soft palate carries little to no edge, while flavors of cooked berry and carob finish with notes of raisin and rubber. This bullish wine has its good points but it's tough and challenging.
The aromas first convey a somewhat stemmy, weedy impression, and that is woven into the flavors as well. What ultimately brings the wine into better balance is the underlying red fruit, tangy and substantial, with good length through the finish.
Oak-driven aromas of vanilla, coconut and spice lead to jammy dark fruit flavors. It's polished in feel, with tart acids on the finish.
Sourced from what is arguably Red Willow's finest block of Syrah, this is superbly balanced and remarkably concentrated for this cool site from a cool vintage. Cassis fruit is streaked with licorice and mocha, showing plenty of new oak influence without sacrificing depth or fruit. Drink soon or tuck it away for a few more years; either way it's a gem.
After an initial clarified butter aroma invites one in, this fleshy, full-bodied white is smooth and delicate, taking on body and weight as it develops in the glass. Anise, green apple and pineapple flavors meet a coterie of toasted oak and smoke.
This is a gorgeous white wine (100% Falanghina) that is generous in terms of its bouquet but compact and streamlined at the same time. The mouthfeel is smooth and crisp and is accented by creamy peach flavors.
Fresh, crunchy black and red cherries and aromatic blueberries seem to be dusted with white pepper and cinnamon: how very appetizing. The same freshness appears on the palate where the fruit is subsumed into a textured core. Oak just lends a little spice and structure but lets the fruit and its very own freshness pervade everything. At every turn, more cherry breaks through the supple tannic frame. Joyful , refreshing and balanced abundance sets the tone while spicy pepper echoes all the way.
This clonal study blends rich black cherry and sassafras notes with cola, savory herbs, strong iron and slight scorched rubber aromas. The palate jumps from a red cherry and cranberry tartness right into a toasted sage and pencil-lead character.
A floral and lightly citric nose introduces this dry, crisply elegant Riesling. The wine cleanses the palate with compact and detailed  flavors and leaves you reaching quickly for the next sip. This brand new wine for Breuer is designed especially for early consumption and wine-by-the-glass programs, and fulfills its mission beautifully. Best Buy.
Just when you thought Doug McCrea could not make a better Grenache, he has. This year's blend, which includes 17% Syrah, simply has more muscle and more grip than ever before. The wine is loaded with concentrated berry preserves, then spiced up with pepper and minerality. Just the right amount of chocolate fills in the back end.
Both stewy and sweet on the nose. The palate is brawny and unctuous, with big berry fruit getting gobbled up by the wine's grabby, tannic structure. This is wild, rubbery, young Cab. Air it out and serve at your barbecue.
Tasted in a flight with other 2003 Stellenbosch Cabs, this wine stood out due to its higher acidity which lifted the flavors of cassis and blackberry. Unfined and unfiltered.
Ruby-violet in color, this wine has aromas of cherry, cola and almond blossom. Smooth and bright on the palate, with soft tannins, shades of cherry, menthol and smoked meat bring nuance to the finish.
This is Morgan's everyday, southern Rhône-style blend. Quality has varied over the years. The '05 is Grenache and Syrah. It's dry, full-bodied and simple, with cherry, blackberry and loganberry flavors that finish with a scour of astringent tannins.
So fresh and balanced, there's structured mineral-driven support to the red apple, juicy lemon and sweet spice flavors. Medium weight, the ripe mouth is coupled with great acidity to cut through any flab. A soft toastiness kicks up the finish.
With a light structure and some minerality, this is an attractive, textured wine. Flavors of apples, citrus fruits and a note of caramel pair with its zesty character that lends an attractive finishing bite.
The aromas are light, with notes of white flowers, green herbs and peach. The flavors are tart and elegant in style, seeming quite watery in concentration.
Beaulieu's basic Napa Cab is dry and balanced wine, with the accent on balance. This is a wine that stays in the background, letting food star, but that doesn't mean it's not complex. It is thoroughly rewarding, an ideal restaurant wine. Should develop well for 10 years.
Soft spice and blackberry on the nose are followed by rich, balanced layers of mint, toast and berry. The wine has a minerality that adds a fresh note to the mix. A big wine but not overly complex, this is a Cabernet for spicy dishes and beef stew. Imported by GBW, LLC.

Lychee and honeysuckle notes are concentrated and pure in this bright off-dry Gewürztraminer. It's elegantly structured, lifted by zesty tangerine acidity and hints of dusty pollen and mineral that linger on the finish. Drink now.
More of a Bordeaux-style blend than a straight Cabernet, the remaining 25% includes a mix of Merlot, Malbec and Petit Verdot. It's a thin wine, drying and tannic, with dried fruit flavors that lack freshness. Tannins are leafy and finish with a green edge.
A softly textured, fruity wine that has a feeling of richness. Apricot fruits are balanced by lime crispness. Full and ripe, it's ready to drink.
A partnership between Portuguese and Spanish winemakers, this is an impressive wine, powered by ripe fruit, solid tannins and a dense texture. It is serious, the structure important, and it needs aging.
Fairly generic on the nose, with a floral accent. The mouthfeel is tannic and hard, thus the name Toro de Piedra (Bull of Stone) is appropriate. Rubbery, dark and baked flavors of blackberry and chocolate give this a masculine personality, and the finish is pure nails. This may be one to hold for another year; maybe the tannins will soften.
Here's an easy expression of Insolia that opens with citrus, kiwi and almond paste aromas. The wine is a perfect choice for appetizers of toasted tomato bruschetta and chopped basil.
Only a select portion of a prized 30-year-old vineyard gives fruit to the wine named after the Eguren brothers' great grandfather.

Fermented and aged only in stainless steel to preserve freshness, this is a crisp Gavi with scents of green apples and limes and a dose of chalk-like minerality. Crystalline clean, but with a slightly creamy texture.
Though the vineyard sources—Stillwater and Conner Lee—are first-rate, this wine seems a bit disjointed at the moment. Sweet, juicy fruit opens up into a midpalate that seems to have a hole, and then the aggressive flavors of vanilla surface. The vanilla-tinged finish feels tacked on, though perhaps some further bottle age will help to smooth it.
Dried strawberry, black raspberry, cola, salted licorice and turned earth show on the nose of this wine from a vineyard in the Corralitos area near Watsonville. The palate is quite earthy and herbal, with dried mint, thyme, rosemary and graphite adding nuance to the cranberry fruit.

Rosso del Conte is a landmark Sicilian red that boasts deep and penetrating concentration, finesse with light berry fruit and mineral notes, and extraordinary intensity in the mouth. This is a profound wine that sees 18 months of French oak. The tannins are still tight, so drink after 2008. Imported by Winebow.

There's a freshness to this wine, a product of the cool 2013 vintage. It plays down the rich spice and pushes up the crisp apple flavors, giving a dry character that's refreshing. It can be drunk now.

Smoke, cocoa and char aromas meld with cola and baking spice accents. The medium-bodied palate is approachable and feels finessed, with its balanced acids and chalky tannins giving footing to the wine. A note of cola repeats on the finish with great precision.
Minerally and pure, with coastal-influenced nettle, green apple and passion fruit aromas. This is a very good, snappy wine with pure citrus, minerality, lime and grapefruit flavors. And that's also how it finishes. As the field of coastal Chilean SBs grow, Cool Coast from Casa Silva is one to keep an eye on.
A nicely done microscopic-production Syrah out of Livermore Valley's Madden Ranch, the source for many a Syrah, not always so deliciously rendered. Winemaker Greg Jenkins (wife and partner is Olympian Peggy Fleming) works with a variety of grape sources from his historic Novitiate Winery in Los Gatos, using John Madden's hillside vineyard fruit in this case to make an intense wine full of cassis, vanilla, anise and chocolate.
It's not just the fruit, which is immaculately ripe in blackberries and black currants. The wine also stands out for the richness of the oak, so perfectly integrated, and the overall balance. Beautiful acidity and thick, rich, supple tannins come along with a gorgeous, long, dry finish. The vineyard is in Yountville. You'll want to cellar this 100% Cab until at least 2020, and it could be going strong longer.
With 40% Grenache, 40% Syrah, 20% Carignan and no oak aging, this is a fresh and juicy wine with characteristics of black cherry, black berry, thyme, Asian spice and cola. Solid acidity and a medium finish make this an easy pleaser.
Syrah, Castelão and Aragonez go into the blend of this rich juicy wine. It is so soft and ripe, just hinting at tannins and with red-berry fruit. The wine is round and smooth, ready to drink.
This is a classy wine, showing a deep core of ripe blackberries, black currants and spices, with a smoked meat richness, like crispy bacon. Beyond the flavors is a fine mouthfeel, composed of smooth tannins and a nice bite of acidity.
A crisp, fresh and creamy wine, it has grapefruit acidity and a firm sense of mineral structure. The wine is developing well, but to bring out its balance between fruit and texture, it needs until 2015 in bottle.
Fairly light aromas of fresh lemon, nectarine, scratched grapefruit skin and a little chalk show on the nose of this crisp bottling. The palate is all about tension and acid-driven freshness, with pear peels and lime rinds making for a slightly sour sip.
This appellation blend shows buttered toast with lemon marmalade on the nose, with a growing sense of tropicality. The palate is plush and smoky, with vanilla and cream flavors cut by just enough citrusy tang to keep it serious.
The blend is 73% Shiraz and 27% Cabernet, yielding a full-bodied, creamy-textured wine that still shows touches of Cabernet structure. Powerful notes of mocha, spice, dried fruit and chocolate come to a velvety crescendo on the long finish. Drink now–2015.
Tastes young and vigorous and almost rude in youth, offering strong, extracted blackberry, cherry and raspberry flavors. The tannins have sharp elbows, and the oak is entirely unintegrated. Seems altogether immature. Give it a good five years in the cellar, and try again.
This is a tight wine with red-currant fruits and plenty of acidity. It is crisp and very fresh, demanding a few more months to calm down. Drink from 2017.

This is a rounded, ripe and fruity wine named after a red star in the Cetus constellation. It is immediately drinkable with attractive red-currant fruit flavors along with perfumed acidity and just a touch of orange zest. The wine is refreshing and very ready to drink.
This is a massive, brooding Riesling that seems to demand time in the cellar. Sweet corn, smoke and peach kernel notes mark the bouquet, while the powerful mineral flavors are accented by apple and peach. Broad and palate-coating in texture, with a long, oily finish, this is undeniably impressive.
Soft and smooth, this barrel-fermented wine remains fruit-driven. The barrel time seems to have rounded it off, rather than adding any noticeable toast. Pleasant flavors of apple sauce carry a hint of spice.
Round and full-bodied, this has warm apricot and ripe pineapple flavors. It has weight and richness, with a touch of toast and a smoky finish.
Textbook Albariño from what's shaping up into one of Galicia's best years in a long time.

Fruity and fresh, this has aromas of red berry and pomegranate. The scents flow through to the easygoing palate along with raspberry and bright acidity.
A 70-30 blend of Catarratto and Chardonnay, this wine offers enormous freshness in the form of citrus blossom, white almond, honey, lemon mousse and basil leaf notes. It feels silky, crisp and light.

Citrus fruits and rind are the lead aromas on this minerally Verdejo. Passion fruit, nectarine, orange and saline flavors finish with pithy grapefruit and almond-skin flavors. Overall this is tangy and holds firm. Drink now.
This wine's violet, baking spice and herb aromas carry over to its bright, straightforward palate together with sour cherry, pomegranate and a blast of orange zest. Bracing tannins and racy acidity, although assertive, provide support.
From all-estate fruit, this dives into experimentation with 85% whole cluster fermentation and native yeast. The results are mixed, giving herbal and white pepper accents to the bright red-berry flavors, but putting a bitter edge on the tannins. A couple more years of bottle age would be a good idea. It's too young to show its best at the moment.
Pear and kiwi aromas are a bit richer here than in many Albariños. In the mouth, this mature wine is fleshy and melony. Flavors of pulpy citrus, pear and apple finish pithy, with a touch of lasting minerality. This wine seems to be slowly fading; drink now.
This wine is at the top of its class in a new generation of super Tuscan producers. Plush and velvety, it opens with rich aromas of chocolate, cherry, peppercorn, black fruit and cola. Thick extraction sets the tone for a lush wine that requires a few more years in the bottle: Drink after 2012.
Brambly and wild on the nose, this Cafayate Malbec features a narrow palate with edgy, briary plum and berry flavors. This seems riper with time in the glass, but all the way through it's pinchy in feel and ultimately ends with candied sweetness.
Soft and sensual in the mouth, this offers rich, complex layers of cherries, red plums, mocha and cedar. So gentle and luscious, you can drink it now, despite the tannins.

Less bright and perfumed than La Coterie's Passe Colline bottling, this is still a soft, approachable wine with ample cherry fruit. Hints of leather and white pepper give it a bit of complexity. The blend is 65% Grenache, 25% Syrah and 10% Carignan.
This is a big, concentrated wine, impressive for 2007. There are solid tannins, with additional great acidity, and plenty of structure and ripeness. Red plums give a finishing lift.
There's a core of preserved black fruit in this Merlot-dominant Bordeaux-style blend, but also notes of leafy dill and stem that add a vegetal quality. Elegant and a bit lean on the palate, it finishes with persistent, yet finely textured tannins.
Thick ruby concentration sets the stage and slowly gives way to warm wood tones and chocolate syrup flavors. There are some green aromas redolent of dill weed or pickle juice, but they are not prominent enough to distract from an otherwise pretty picture.
From several of the producer's estate vineyards, this wine traffics in spicy, leathery texture and robust full-bodied power, layering in more tart savory characteristics of rhubarb, dark cherry and orange. The tannins are firm and supportive, taking on a velvety sheen.
Early match-stick aromas fade and give way to scents of white fruits and wisteria flower. The plump palate offers papaya, peach and nectarine flavors, while the finish dries out quickly, leaving a slight pithy bitterness. A little bland but still pretty good. Imported by W.J. Deutsch & Sons.
91–93. Barrel sample. This is a big and fruity wine with solid tannins and dense structure. It's ripe and rich—packed with black plum—and yet modern and polished.
Bold berry aromas turn a little sweet and simple with airing, while the palate deals plum and berry flavors on a tight, tannic frame. Bright and colorful but fairly rough and basic in what it has to offer.
Starts out pretty good and fruity, but becomes more challenged with time. There's a truckload of early raspberry fruit, but it turns more sharp and piercing the more time it sits. Lengthy and potent, but not elevated.
All tangy fruit, this simple wine is light, with citrus and crisp pear flavors. A touch of honey adds a soft side while keeping its zesty fruit right in place. Drink now.
From stunningly set vines overlooking the Carmel Valley that in this vintage produced only 1.25 tons an acre (or 1.12 pounds per plant) comes this stellar wine, redolent on the nose with black plum, mulberry, turned earth, wet mud, woody sagebrush, incense and sandalwood. There is great energy on the palate, with mulberry and elderberry flavors enhanced by light coffee, soil and fennel bulbs.
Ripe strawberry pie and cigar box aromas frame the nose on this top-end offering from Broken Earth. It's surprisingly light on the palate, with cherry pie and cranberry tartness leading the way alongside bright acidity and dainty tannins.
Applause to Brunello tipicity in the form of balsam notes (menthol cough drop), forest berry, black licorice, tar and background vanilla to smooth over the sharp points. The tannins are still thorny but the finish is long and limber. Imported by Premier Wine Co.
Sugary and simple, with sweet cola, licorice, blackberry and cherry jam flavors. The tannins are very finely structured, but the wine is just too sweet.
Made in the style of a southern Rhône blend (half Viognier and one quarter each Marsanne and Roussanne), this is lightly lemony, with a bit more fat in the middle. None of the three grapes overpowers the others, but the flavors feel a bit generic. Though fermented in stainless steel, it's gold in color and shows some hints of toast.
The Côte Est Pinot Noir is more structured and less immediately accessible than the winery's Rocheux bottling, but ultimately may prove to be the better bottle. It offers tightly woven, chewy fruit flavors of black cherry, black raspberry and plum, along with darker streaks of clove, leaf, smoke and earth. As always, the wine is structured with elegant precision.

This is a modern Tempranillo with big berry fruit aromas offset by baking spice scents and earthiness. The palate feels bold and punchy, with round but present tannins and ripe flavors of baked blackberry, chocolate and mild spice. Drink this friendly, fruity, elevated wine through 2016.
The nose on this blend of Gewurztraminer and Macabeo defines neutral; it's clean but shows little more than a whiff of apple. The palate is fresh and quick moving, with mild peach, pear, apple and melon flavors that culminate in a solid finish that's not very exciting but doesn't stray.
There almost is a touch of red apple amidst all of the aromatic red and black cherries. The palate is juicy and concentrated—the finely-woven tannins crunch just a little and everything is brightened by freshness. This is a very harmonious, fruit-driven and juicy Pinot Noir that is full of ready joy. The finish is aromatic, long and moreish.
Here's a fresh and feminine expression of Pinot Nero with nuances of wild berry and white cherry followed by light touches of spice and almond skin. Balanced acidity and a lively finish make the wine very enjoyable indeed.
This new wine comes courtesy of Bernard Portet (Clos du Val) and son, and for the most part it's on the money. The aromas are a touch horsey to start, and the red fruit is racy more than beefy. But it has a lot of flavor, full tannins and good balance. If aired out and served with meat or stew, it won't disappoint.
This blend of Zinfandel, Petite Sirah and Charbono is similar to wines made from those field-blended vineyards where several grape varieties are inter-planted. The wine is dry and robust, with intensely fruity, spicy flavors and firm tannins. Best now for its sheer exuberance.

This wine is bright, fruity and packed with berries and juicy black cherries. The acidity gives a fresh character that balances the sweetly ripe fruits. Ready to drink, this is a deliciously fruity wine.
This has retained some sweetness and is a pleasant, light take on Viognier. There are gentle notes of celery, melon and citrus, and a hint of toasted almond in the finish. A nice balance of acid and fruit keeps it on point through the finish.
The 2007 Excelsus is a gorgeous super Tuscan expression (with Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot) that shows quality and superior fruit on all levels. Castello Banfi has really hit a home run with this vintage. You'll encounter persuasive aromas of cassis, blackberry, chocolate, tobacco, curry leaf and deep renderings of exotic spice. The wine's texture is exceedingly smooth, rich and long lasting.
Cabernet Sauvignon in this ripe wine gives it a tannic edge, adding to the acidity and crispness. It has a juicy character with spice and red-currant fruits comfortably in balance. The aftertaste is soft, with just a shot of acidity.

This concentrated wine brings tannins together with superripe black fruits and a firm aftertaste. A bite of alcohol spoils the rich fruitiness. Drink from 2018.
Leather, tobacco, citrus peel and herbs make for a controlled bouquet that doesn't smack you in the face. The body, however, is tannic and grabby, while the flavors of sweet berry carry a roasted angle and a dash of spice. Chocolaty and spicy on the finish, but again it goes down hard and tannic, which is a drawback.
Big, rich wine, packed with spice, ripe peach and mango flavors. Designated a Library Wine by Knoll, it is complex, ageworthy, with a weight of both fruit and pepper to it. Keep this powerful wine for at least another 2–3 years.
The first release on the winery's new label program, which shines a bright light on the soils of their sprawling vineyard atop the Cuesta Grade, this offers clean aromas of lemon peel. The palate is almost spritzy with energy, showing lime juice, green pear and dried-apple flavors all bound together by a searing acidity.
This sweet rosé is light and crisply fruity. Strawberry flavors make it an immediately refreshing and enjoyable apéritif wine.
Yellow grapefruit pith, white Asian pear flesh, cherimoya and crisp stonefruit elements show on the nose of this bottling, which also offers the typical touch of petrol. The palate is very pithy and high-toned, showing lemon rind, sour orange and sour apple on the finish.
Typically Navarran in that the nose is green, with herbal aromas along with cherry and heat. The palate has decent weight and feel, but the flavors are rooty and herbal, with a similar finish. Solid but probably more herbal/green than what most people are seeking.
This Shiraz speaks of its terroir, with its savory black pepper, plum and cassis nose and balanced black fruit, spice and cedar flavors. Full of ripe, rich fruit and tied together with an elegant spicy backbone. Pair with grilled meat or go spicy and try Asian or Mexican alongside.

The wine balances acidity and full fruitiness. These show in the lively, fresh character as well as the rich apple and pear flavors. The end shows more youthful texture, offering the chance to hold this wine until 2015.
Almost impossible to distinguish this nice and easy Garnacha from the winery's Monte Oton label (also rated 89). Open berry and jam aromas keep it together, while the saturated, sweet blackberry palate is living proof of Campo de Borja's sun and terroir. Ripe, deep and easy to enjoy.
This unoaked Chardonnay starts with aromas of citrus and stalky greens. It's plump in the mouth, with soft acids and flavors of pineapple and other tropical fruits. It's just fresh enough, but mostly it's innocuous.

A solid wine, finely constructed, its chunky tannins blending well with the red-plum-juice flavors. The acidity is important, along with the tasty cherry texture. Age for 3–4 years.

In its memorable dumpy bottle, this LBV is full of sweet ripe fruits, soft tannins and perfumed acidity. The texture is firm and structured at the end. Drinkable now, but worth aging for a year or two.
Made from 80% Syrah and 20% Grenache, this starts off a touch closed and quiet, but with time reveals notes of black plum, blackberry, licorice, chicory, black pepper and leather. It is strongly textured, with firm tannins and black fruit-skin flavors that linger through the finish. Drink 2018–2021.

A dense wine, from one of the landmark chateaus of Listrac. It is a little rough around the edges at this stage, but wait for the chunky tannins to soften and the black plum fruits to come forward.
A nice Chardonnay if you like really strong fruit and spice. Mouth-watering flavors of tropical fruits and super-ripe peaches, and a creamy, tangerine note that follows all the way through to the rich, slightly sweet finish. May be too big for some, but that's the style.
From a vineyard in Yountville, this wine has a voluptuous entry of baked peach and vanilla, with a back beat of tart key lime. Layered and lengthy, it offers flavor and body in abundance, ending fleshy and full.
Thin and dry, with oak and alcohol flavors modestly enriched with a touch of pineapples, green apples and minerals. Sadly, this is not the glorious Sonoma-Cutrer of the past.
There's a savory, almost toasted quality to this Barbaresco, resembling hazelnut, spice and crème de cassis. The bouquet is slightly weighed down by those bold aromas, but the mouthfeel is fresh and bright.
Bright delivery with aromas of cola, root beer, humus, crème de cassis, forest berry and wild raspberry. It shows finely textured tannins with a bitter almond or bitter chocolate aftertaste. Brambly, sharp, acidic and well defined.

The best of the three vineyard designates in 2010, this firm and full-flavored wine is still a bit tight, and rewards extra breathing time. It tastes like a bowl full of berries and plums with pretty mocha highlights.
Bosan is a beautiful Amarone with gorgeous intensity and personality. It's a rich, ripe wine with perfectly integrated aromas of jammy fruit and exotic spice followed by pretty mineral and tobacco shadings. It's also particularly successful in the mouth where it shows both depth and persistency.

This buoyant Chardonnay starts with fresh aromas of lemon and gooseberry, followed by tropical fruit, citrus and spice flavors. Medium-bodied with a friendly, fruity character. Pair with fresh fish, meats or cream sauces.
Grassy green underdeveloped aromas are not what Emilio Moro wines are known for, but given that this is a 2013, these scents are not without foundation. The palate follows the nose with raw pulling tannins and green-leaning flavors of basil, plum and boysenberry. A tight scouring finish is consistent with what came before it.
There's a touch of sulfur that takes a few seconds to blow off. Once it does, this wine offers yellow rose, exotic fruit, peach and almond skin.

Ample blueberry and black cherry fruit is toned by fresh acidity and held in a concentrated body. Little by little the Zweigelt pepperiness creeps in and makes for a punchy, focused red with just the right amount of still perceptible tannins. Great clean finish.

This blended red brings in four of the five Bordeaux varieties (61% Cabernet Sauvignon, 27% Merlot, 8% Cabernet Franc, 4% Petit Verdot). Some prominent mint notes may limit its appeal, but it's otherwise a classic example of the genre, accenting cassis fruit with hints of vanilla and cedar. Despite the ample alcohol and a bit of warmth, there's also some austerity and firmness to the tannins. Drink 2018–2025.
A middle-tier wine that's honest and good for the money. Smells of spunky citrus fruit and vanilla, then offers a tight, minerally palate with a mix of white peach, lemon and lime flavors. Crisp and quick on the finish, with a lemony aftertaste.
Considerably more tannic than most Rutherford Cabs, especially a non-mountain one, Riboli's '06 displays ripe flavors of cherries, blackberries, currants and mint. It doesn't seem to have the stuffing for aging, so drink now with rich steaks that can break through the astringency.
Winemaker Joe Forest has brightened the fruit and livened up the mouthfeel by blending in 20% Grenache. Fresh raspberry flavors are wrapped into the earthier, herbal, lightly chocolaty character of the Syrah. Once-filled French barrels were used.

This is a powerful bottling, as is expected by this producer, showing fresh boysenberry, purple flower potpourri, tart black plums and a touch of rosemary on the nose. It's undeniably delicious at first sip, with caramelized blackberry and hints of thyme and rosemary. The texture is squeaky and sticky, and it's a bit sweet and boozy, but a definite Paso crowd-pleaser.
A tremendous Syrah, the way Pride makes all their red wines. The mashed ripe cherries, cherry liqueur and mocha flavors immediately explode, leading to a deep, long-lasting and spicy finish. With intense mountain concentration and a smattering of sweet, smoky oak, it's best enjoyed soon for its sheer, heady power.

Aromatic notes of red rose, raspberry and blueberry shape the nose of this brilliantly pink rosé. The wine is intense and full of delicate spice and candied fruit nuances that promise an excellent pairing with fish couscous.
A full and rich style, with sweetness and jammy red fruits lifted by a citrus touch. This is full-bodied, red currant cordial, very fruity.
This wine is direct and candied, with cherry and raspberry jam and and sweet oak flavors, but brightened with crisp acidity. A very good Pinot, but pricey for the quality. Keep in mind that this is not one of Rochioli's vineyard-designated bottlings.
Earthy aromas of tilled soil, meat juices and blackberry are accompanied by flavors of black cherry and nutmeg. The palate is already evolved and shows tertiary aromas, with a slight warmth throughout, so drink over the next few years.
This wine's initial aromatics come across as rather subdued, but give them some time and they begin to unfurl into minerally billows of slate and citrus. This shows the crisp, tight structure of the Saar—it's a tightly coiled spring of green apple and citrus fruits around a core of minerality. Should age through 2015.
Touches of bramble and smoke meander curiously amid sweet strawberry and cherry in this off-dry rosé. While a bit candied on the palate, it's a juicy approachable wine for casual imbibing.

This medium-bodied wine smells a bit like a bouquet of pineapple, sage and lemony thyme. On the palate, the wine is restrained and citrusy, with a clean, refreshing finish.
Kicks off with nutty, meaty aromas that move easily into apple and pear flavors. Marked by ripe fruit—Golden Delicious apples—and spice, finishing with echoes of clove and cinnamon.
This fine Pinot Noir easily holds its own when tasted against far more expensive bottlings. It's softly silky and delicately structured and enormously rich, offering delicious waves of raspberries, cherries, oranges, cola, beef jerky and black pepper. A perfect Pinot Noir to drink now. Easy to find, with nearly 13,000 cases produced.
A blend of citric and tropical aromas is nice, while the palate is right for the most part as it deals ripe green apple and lime flavors. There's a slight creaminess to the feel, but the flavors are all zesty citrus and such. Imported by Racke USA, Inc.
This wine suggests green, savory herbs along with cherry and currant. It's elegant in style, velvety in feel, and delivers good concentration to the fruit flavors plus barrel notes (20% new French) on the lingering finish. The variety gets lost with the herbal notes taking over, but it still offers enjoyment.
Simple and innocent, a small Sauvignon with hints of citrus fruits and figs. Very dry, with crisp acidity and a clean, peppery finish.
Basic but full and ripe, with black cherry and cassis aromas. The palate has some snap and clack to it, but flavors of raspberry are softened and enriched by vanilla and creamy accents. Shows more on the nose than in the mouth, but overall it is a nice wine.
This 60-40 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot opens with jammy aromas of cherry marmalade and blackberry preserves. The fruit tones are very intense but the spice nuances are integrated and folded within the natural density of the mouthfeel.
The Yarra Valley's relatively cool climate really shows through in this wine's smoky, herbal nuances, which sometimes threaten to take over from the primary cherry fruit. It's lean, more in the Rhône style, and finishes with tart cherries and hints of meaty portobello mushrooms. —J.C.
This wine starts out lightly reductive, providing initial distraction from the aromas of pear, lees and spice. The palate is medium bodied, with a creamy, generous feel.
The relatively low residual sugar in this wine gives it a leaner feel than Mosbacher's other 2007s, but the fruit comes through as lime, grapefruit and passion fruit, marked by Forst's prominent minerality. Very crisp and long; would pair well with many seafood dishes.
Soft and hot, with some raisin flavors alongside the blackberries and mulberries. The finish is dry and astringent in tannins. Not likely to age, so drink up.
Among barrel-fermented Verdejos from the Rueda region, this one is at the top of what is a small hierarchy. Lemon and toasty oak are the key aromas, while the palate is not whacked out with wood or resin as it offers oaky support to apple and citrus fruit. Long and focused on the finish.
Solid but flat aromas of olive and leafy berry fruits introduce a midland palate of moderate bounce and average body. Raspberry, plum, currant and herbal flavors finish fresh, but also woody and slightly bitter in taste.
An excellent lineup of vineyards, including estate, Red Mountain and Champoux fruit, contribute to this firm, meaty Merlot. It is chewy and substantial, with a core of black cherry and plenty of new oak. It resolves into flavors of mushroom, earth, coffee grounds and grainy baking chocolate. A return to form after the disappointing '02.
Here's a variety you never see, let alone from Australia. The nose offers notes of bread, cracker and forward berry. Ripe blackberry flavors are dusty and sandy around the edges, and close with soft tannins. Not a huge, overstuffed wine; fine for the dinner table. 1,000 cases imported. Imported by Windshaker Ridge Imports.
Here's a simple, fresh Vermentino that shows lively tones of yellow fruit, kiwi and a touch of freshly cut grass. The wine is tonic, crisp and keeps the palate clean. Screw cap.
Tolosa has been making seriously good Syrah for some years now. The quality shows not just in the ripeness, but in the acidity that gives the wine brightness and balance. This was a warm vintage, even in cool Edna Valley, and the wine shows extraordinarily powerful blackberry-pie filling, cherry compote and chocolate flavors, but that high acidity really makes the fruit sing.
This is half Merlot, with Pinot Noir, Cab Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon divvying up the other half—a completely different Ranch Red than in 2013. It's sweaty and short, with some off flavors in the finish.
This is a very lean and dry expression of Prosecco Superiore that does a great job of refreshing a thirsty mouth on a hot summer day, but adds little else. Lemon and white flower aromas are backed by sharp bubbles.
While this wine has both fine tannins and a steely, mineral structure, it also offers generous ripe berry fruits that give fresh acidity and a full-bodied feel. The wine is made to be drunk young and fruity, almost now, certainly by 2016.
With no oak, the pure, brilliantly ripe Chardonnay fruit shines through in this rewarding wine. It's so rich in tropical fruit, peach, pear and citrus flavors, you won't even miss the barrel influence. Best of all is the cool-climate crispness that makes the finish so clean and vibrant.
Very gamy and umami-rich aromas of bacon fat and animal hide meet with maple, boysenberry, white pepper, rosemary and teriyaki on the nose of this bottling. The savory and somewhat smoky touches thrive on the palate too, where roasted pork and charred plums combine with coffee bean and warm-toast flavors.
The earthy brick color and dry fruit aromas announce that this isn't a typical wine. The blend is Merlot, Callet and Syrah, and it hails from the island of Mallorca. The wine is a bit tough and angular, but the plum, raspberry and cherry flavors are tightly formed and fenced in by potent acidity and oak. Interesting but not for everyone.
The winery's top estate-grown Cabernet, meticulously crafted to age, this is pungent in cardamon and clove, wrapped around hardbound layers of blackberry and raspberry. Elegant and refined, with chalky tannins that will further soften over time, it offers a polished, elegant expression of dried cherries, dark chocolate and brown sugar to round out the finish. This beautiful wine should continue to show well through 2030–2040.
Apple and peach aromas struggle to reach the rudimentary level. There's a slight vegetal note to the flavor profile along with sugary melon and pear. This feels flat but not tired, and things taste mildly green and candied on the finish.
Tropical fruit, citrus and Mediterranean scrub aromas take center stage in this lively white. It's bright and savory, doling out juicy grapefruit, white peach and pineapple flavors, with crisp acidity and a mouthwatering saline note.
Made with 70% Sangiovese, 15% Sagrantino and 15% Merlot, this opens with subtle aromas of red berry and underbrush. The straightforward palate delivers black plum, clove and tobacco alongside smooth tannins. Enjoy through 2018.
Pretty dark, almost plum-like in color, this is a blend of 76% Grenache and 25% Syrah from an estate-grown vineyard in the Foothills. Lots of watermelon in aroma and flavor, the wine finishes slightly sweet, reminiscent of a Shirley Temple.
Intense smoke and mineral tones mingle with fragrant lemon peel and lavender in this slightly exotic off-dry Riesling. It's buoyantly peachy yet also cutting and spry, finishing bright on a streak of tangerine acidity.
It's a brilliant gold color, luscious, with spicy/toasty aromas and a hint of leesy character. The fruit is a complex mix of apricot, pineapple, and melon, with excellent acidity, and the Sauvignon Blanc gives it a melony streak.
This opens with aromas of violet, ripe berry, orange zest, toasted oak and a whiff of Mediterranean scrub. The structured palate offers mature cherry, white pepper, licorice, well-integrated oak spices, vanilla and grilled sage alongside firm, polished tannins. Showing the heat of the vintage, it's a bit warm on the midpalate but it still retains finesse.
There's a good array of purple-flower aromas, including lavender and potpourri, on the nose of this bottling, as well as light cola and plum skins. The sip is quite bitter and tarry though, with just a touch of riper black fruit.
Creamy and smooth, this barrel-fermented Viognier has peach and citrus fruit, with grace notes of ginger and nutmeg. There is even a hint of honey as it gathers strength in the back of the throat, with noticeable alcohol also.
Vibrant and youthful, this wine greets the taster with fresh, clean scents of honey, fall flowers and roses. It's medium-bodied and crisp, with a final peach note that fades a bit too quickly. Try with Thai curry. No improvement with age; drink before 2011.
Very vivid notes of green citrus signal refreshment and lightness. The palate confirms this near weightless lightness and underlines it with fine tiny bubbles that fizz away creamily, providing a counterpoint and resulting in a wine that is both exquisitely light, dry, creamy and elegant. If you are looking for a sophisticated but light apéritif, this is your answer.
Crushed violet, iris, spiced plum and raisin aromas come together on this. The structured palate offers dried black cherry, blackberry jam, licorice and nutmeg alongside firm, fine-grained tannins. It closes on a note of roasted coffee bean.
Very polished, with rich blackberry, chocolate, tea and cedar aromas. Full cocoa and black-cherry and cola accents add to the flavor of sour plums on the graceful palate. The texture is suave and luxurious. Closes with dusty, soft, even tannins and some cocoa notes. Has good depth and claret-like poise. Very approachable now; drink to 2010.
A fairly action-packed nose combines yellow grapefruit, lemon blossoms, nectarine flesh and yellow melon with slate and a shred of bubblegum on the finish. The palate starts quite tight with pear rinds, and then gets riper with shaved apples, bubblegum and tropical elements.
There's a baked, roti quality to the aroma of this wine, suggesting the crust of a fresh cherry pie, with the cherry filling flavors accented by vanilla and cinnamon and even a drizzle of crème de cassis. It's a very decadent beverage. Who could have dreamed California Pinot could taste this good? On the other hand, the very size will intimidate chefs. Where is this monster style of Pinot Noir going? Stay tuned.
Intensely petrolly on the nose, with a rather full mouthfeel and dense, minerally flavors. This is stolid and sullen right now, but undeniably intense. Hints of spice on the finish bode well for the future, so stow it away for 3–4 years before trying it with something substantial, like roast pork.
A big round, juicy wine which is a perfect barbecue wine. Packed with berry and herbal flavors, it is soft, ripe, with a light layer of tannins. From a blend of local grapes, this is ready to drink now.
Pale orange-pink in color, this is fruity and light. It coveys a bright, fresh character that is both refreshing and very crisp. Drink now.
Rustic with softened tannins, this Charbono, a rare sight in California where fewer than 100 acres are planted, is inky and mellow, its acidity a good match for a range of goopy, Italian-inspired foods.
Unusual aromatics are dominated by hints of zucchini and other green vegetables. There's a pleasant spice theme to the palate but also some very aggressive tannins. Rhubarb flavors show through on the medium finish. Give the tannins a few years to round out.
Confirming its place in the firmament of Pauillac greats, Clerc Milon's 2010 has huge density, and is packed with dark tannins and blackberry flavor. It has a delicious freshness that cuts right through, lifting the concentration. With its tannins, this promises long-term aging.
The nose here is accented by nutty aromas and some mineral tones too, but ultimately, stone fruit and melon take center stage. This is a tight and structured white wine that would pair with roasted chicken and rosemary or Cornish game hen.
Crisp and easy with a pristine and luminous appearance and nice tones of pear and peach blossom, this is a no-fuss white that would pair well with fish or appetizers. The alcohol is a bit high but it offers clean acidity and mineral tones in the mouth for balance.
A solid wine with mineral, white pepper and waxy fruit aromas. The palate is ripe and bulky, but also acidic enough to be balanced and stylish. Pineapple is the forceful flavor, while the finish is full and slightly oily. Drink this fruity, bigger-framed Albariño now.
Tancredi is always a beautiful wine and this year's expression (a 70-30 blend of Nero d'Avola and Cabernet Sauvignon) offers great aromatic intensity with soft tones of cherry, vanilla and exotic spice. It closes with good structure and polished tannins.
DFJ's venture into the Alentejo has produced a full-bodied wine packed with ripe plums and berry fruits. Tannins are rich, integrated into the fruits. A touch of earthiness needs to blow off before the wine is ready to drink in 2015.
Bordeaux Claret has a darker color than a rosé, suggesting more weight. This wine, though, also has a green herbal edge that is less attractive.
A fruity and juicy wine, it also has a stalky, herbal element. That gives a fresh character to the wine while also showing lightness. The black currant fruits are strong and forward, with a hint of maturity that suggests this is for medium-term aging.
This medium-bodied and elegant Pinot Bianco boasts fragrances of white spring flowers, green apple and flint that carry over to the savory palate. The juicy fruit is supported by fresh acidity that leaves a clean crisp finish, making this extremely food friendly. Oliver McCrum, T. Edward Wines.
Lots of rich, savory Pinot flavors in this silky wine. It's kind of generic, and not showing much sense of terroir, but it is a properly grown coastal wine whose brisk acidity highlights cola, pomegranate and persimmon flavors. Drink up.
Thin fruit flavors seem overtaken by the barrel flavors. The wine spent nine months in one third new French oak—not excessive by any means, but the fruit just isn't up to it at the moment. More bottle age may bring up the light apple into more substantial focus.
This 100% Sangiovese has interesting aromatics, with a pine ester high note over the light strawberry-scented fruit. There is an earthy underpinning; overall a pleasant quaffer with a bit more heft than the winery's other reds.
Cedar, smoked meat and peppery spice on the nose are followed by currants, cigar box and cedar on the palate. Somewhat restraned in the classic style, the wine has a food-friendly elegance and charm.
Initially fresh, with a creamy, white-fruit texture, this has acidity, but it finishes fat and rather hot, with pepper.
Starts with fruit cocktail aromas, which are backed by semisweet orange and lemon flavors. Zesty and clean, with pretty good mouthfeel but not much depth of flavor, complexity or nuance. A good wine on its best day.
The oak sticks out now in the form of toast and sweet wood sap, but that's because it hasn't been integrated into this fine young wine. Give it 3–4 years to come around, by which time the barrel influence will equalize with the ripe raspberries, cherries, Dr. Pepper cola and red currants. Could be quite special around 2015.
Green notes reminiscent of tomato leaves accent fig and melon flavors. It's only medium in body, but comes across as otherwise ripe in style, with a medium-length finish.
Early aromas of menthol and oak settle on floral red berry scents and woodspice. The flavor profile of black cherry and berry is initially narrow, but with time rounds out to deliver a bright, pleasant overall character. The blend consists of 75% Carmenère, 25% Syrah and 5% Carignan.
For unknown reasons, Chuck Reininger holds back his Merlots; but Reininger makes real Merlot—96% pure—and it works. It's silky and smooth, chocolaty and showing pleasing nuances of herb and grass. The fruit is light, pretty and perfectly ripe, tasting of strawberry, cherry and pomegranate.
This young, massive Rioja smells of raspberry, plum, char and tar. The mouthfeel is chunky, rich and deep, with manageable tannins. Blackberry, mocha, char, clove and chocolate flavors announce generous oak, while the finish is spicy, peppery, toasty and ripe. Drink 2018–2034.
A ripe, fresh, appley wine, with attractive grapefruit accents. It is soft and crisp, with just a touch of softness to finish. Simple and great for as apéritif wine.
Blackberry, tobacco, dried purple flowers and bloody meats greet the nose on this solid wine from pioneering winegrower Louis Lucas and his retired judge partner, Royce Lewellen. The palate shows black cherries and plums, with complexity added by tobacco and pepper spice. The flavors come in and go out quickly, proving clean and fresh.
French-born Daniel Manies was the first cellarmaster at Opus One. Now he has his own winery. This inaugural Cab is plush and extremely soft to the point of melted. It's also seriously flavorful. It's like an ambrosiac nectar, all gooey blackberry pie filling and mocha vanilla cream. It's a good start.
The acidity here is certainly the Chenin Blanc, but with the richness of Chardonnay in the mix, the wine has a full character, softly ripe, apples and pears dominant. It has a crisper feel at the end, bright and lively and ready to drink. Screwcap.
The Bishop's Blend is the value bottling at William Church, and the wine that most varies from vintage to vintage. Despite a price bump, the value is still there. In this vintage it's a five grape Bordeaux-style blend with a splash of Grenache as well. Initially silky and bursting with pretty red fruits, it moves into darker fruits as well, with cassis and black cherry. The balance is spot on.
Too oaky, with toothpicky vanilla and caramel flavors swamping the underlying fruit. Too bad, because the basic wine is nice and crisp in pineapples.
A pure expression of Chardonnay, this luminous sparkling wine offers a generous nose with warming tones of yellow rose, apricot, almond paste, baked bread and vanilla cream. The wine spreads smoothly over the palate with a remarkably soft and velvety feel.
From a historic vineyard in the heart of the Napa Valley, this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon develops in the glass, evolving from muted aromas of earth and cinnamon spice to subtle cherry, cassis and oak. Balanced and lovely, the spice stays on the tongue throughout the long finish. It can easily be enjoyed now, but has the structure to age well through 2022.
A relatively new wine in the Yalumba stable, the Scribbler evokes a blend of cherries and cassis, with almost floral herb and tea nuances. It's full bodied and creamy in texture, with a long, lushly textured finish. Drink now–2015. The blend is 63% Cab, 37% Shiraz.
Cabernet, Zinfandel, Shiraz, Merlot and Petite Sirah comprise the blend on this dry, tannic and rustic red wine. It's an easy quaffer with spaghetti, burgers, barbecue and similar fare.
Minerally raspberry and plum aromas are smoky and woodsy in nature. This has a tannic mouthfeel and lightly medicinal, woodsy, briary blackberry and blackcurrant flavors that finish oaky and with a note of anise and/or licorice.
A fragrant, peach and pineapple flavored wine, it's soft, ripe and creamy with just a touch of smoky toast. Worth aging a few months, but delicious now.
It's called extra dry, but it's actually kind of sweet. Not too much, just enough to give a rich, honeyed edge to the strawberry, peach, nectarine and toast flavors.
A gentle hint of restrained citrus freshness appears on the nose. The same restrained but wonderfully pure citrus flavor also characterizes the slender, light and dry palate: it's a mix of fresh lemon and aromatic, tangy tangerine peel. This enlivens and refreshes and has a totally uplifting lemony finish.
A small-production vintage-dated sparkler made from 67% Pinot Noir and 33% Chardonnay, this wine succeeds in its smooth refined contour of peach mousse and vanilla. It's dry, but voluptuously rich, remaining balanced through the tangy tart finish.
An individualistic, some would say eccentric wine, made from grapes grown all over the valley. Your first impression is of jammy sweetness: blackberries, cherries, raspberries, oak. Then the tannins kick in, bringing needed dryness. Shows the ripeness of Napa Valley Cabernet, but doesn't seem like an ager. Drink now–2014.
In vintage after vintage, the winery has chosen to make this blush wine heavier than most rosés in California. They've done so again in 2013, giving a darkly colored, fruity wine you could almost drink unchilled as a table red. It has a Beaujolais-like cherry jamminess that is frankly delicious.
This Tuscan Merlot has a fragrance of ripe plum, berry and cocoa. The palate delivers black currant layered with chocolate and finishes on a drying note of wood. It doesn't have much complexity but it has very attractive fruit.
Homer is the estate reserve, and it's a complete, elegant and stylish wine, that is still in its infancy. Pretty baking spices wrap around tart cherry flavors. There's superb balance among components of fruit, herb, acid and tannin, and it's got excellent length, proportion and detail.
This Savoy Vineyards Pinot Noir tastes of baked red cherry and caramel, with a depth of flavor and soft, silky tannins. On the long finish is a medley of exotic spices and white pepper wrapped in a satisfying profile of juicy goodness.
Notes of dainty white flowers, ripe melon and toasted nuts fill the nose and palate of this full-bodied Malvasia. With a whopping 14.5% alcohol content, there's a bit of heat on the finish and a slightly dusty tone on the palate, but brisk acidity and pleasant astringency on the finish keep it elegant.

Dark amber in color and going greenish at the rim, the basis of this wine is clearly old stocks going back well over 60 years.

The finish is incredibly sweet and long, coating the mouth with coffee-like essences that linger for minutes.

An attractive, very fresh, citrus-flavored wine. It is crisp, tight, tangy and with a young fruity aftertaste. Give it six months to calm down and drink from late 2016 or just revel in the intense, bright fruitiness now.

It's 70% Syrah and 30% Cabernet.

Stick to the Andes, guys. Terranoble's CA1 Andes Carmenère is better than this condensed, oaky coastal specimen with outsized acidity. Aromas of oak-based lemon rind and spice blend with graphite, tea and herbs. Dark flavors don't do so well with blazing acids; too much mixing and matching.

Lots of stubborn sulfur. Earthy, tough flavors, with a dry, rasping finish.

It's an elegant, stately wine to drink now through 2023.
Structure may be the Holy Grail in Oregon, even trumping terroir. This wine has an abundance of both; the Dundee Hills fruit brings rich flavors of blackberry and black cherry, along with interesting notes of iron and earth.

It moves gracefully through the palate, adding a note of spice or a new fruit as it goes, then lingering in a taunting, teasing finish.

The inaugural offering of this block-designate is dark and brooding, with tightly constructed, sizable tannins and oak still pronounced on the palate. Time should develop its floral notes of rose and orange peel, with accents of tea, cranberry and pomegranate. Cellar through 2017.
This is a successful off-dry Champagne emphasizing fruitiness balanced comfortably with acidity. It showscases rich creamed apple and pear alongside a deep citrus element. A great accompaniment for salads, soft cheeses and seafood.
Angular and piquant on the nose, with tight aromas of red zinger tea, fresh herbs and raspberry. This is a Pinot made in a light, coastal style; it offers red cherry, cough drop and tea-like flavors in front of a lasting, unforced but mild finish. A year in French oak has added a buttery element, and overall the wine rings true but distant.
Browning slightly at the edge, and already fully mature, this shows some pretty aromatics of strawberry, flowers and wintergreen mint. Quite light on the palate, but the aromatic thrust gives it plenty of interest. While it will not improve, it is a nice example of a good Barolo that should be drunk over the next five years. Imported by Sapori Italiani Inc.
A restrained nose recalls ripe pear peel and a touch of grapefruit. The palate has a gentle sweetness, with caramelized apple notes. Fresh and balanced, this enticing wine is sweetish but not fully sweet. Lovely now, it will show its true, fascinating Riesling colors only over time. It will hold well through at least 2030.
Aromas bring notes of vanilla bean, black cherry and cassis, along with light volatility. The palate packs a big punch of fruit and barrel flavors, with vanilla notes running high throughout, causing some distraction.
While this wine is lean initially, it also shows weight and the potential of ripe fruits. Concentrated tannins still allow room for a little juicy fruit. The overall effect is of structure triumphing over fruitiness. Made by the team at Domaine de Chevalier, the wine will take time to develop. Drink from 2019.
This dark and chocolaty wine contains 20% Cabernet, which stiffens the tannic spine and contributes some varietal notes of herb and bark. The fruit hits you right up front with black cherry and blackberry and provides a solid foundation for the substantial, smoky, coffee-flavored barrel flavors.
The translucent color and light body warn against aging this wine, but why would you want to? It's delicious right out of the bottle. Rich in black currant, cherry, violet and cedar, it's a blend of all five of the classic Bordeaux varieties.
This is a firmly structured, dark wine. It has black cherry and berry fruit, a solid core of tannins and tight acidity. With its dense character, there is every chance of this impressive wine aging well, yielding a more rounded wine. Drink from 2016.
This is a new line of fairly low-priced varieties from this venerable Napa winery. The Chardonnay, made from very ripe grapes, is good and rich in creamy fruit, with balancing acidity.
A light, crisp wine with flavors of pink grapefruit and cantaloupe melons. The finish is just a touch sweet.
A ripe and smooth wine, its wood aging softening the rough edges of the young fruitiness and bringing a touch of elegance. The wine is spicy with licorice as well as the red fruit flavors. It can be aged, so drink from 2014.
Delicate mineral nuances frame a refined, sweet sparkler redolent of white peach, spring flowers and sweet herbs. The pretty aromatic layering that this Prosecco offers is its distinguishing characteristic.
Fleshy black plums accented with nuts, vanilla and popcorn scent this voluptuously textured red. It's ruddy and ripe, but tinged by a hint of green on the midpalate. Bright red-currant acidity and fine slightly tacky tannins frame the finish. Drink now through 2020.
Smooth and polished, this Merlot combines its plush texture with wonderfully ripe, rewarding cherry, blackberry and woodspice flavors that finish with a chocolate fudginess. Yet the wine is dry. This is a good buy for a Napa wine of this complexity.
Citrus and herb aromas set the mouth watering, anticipating a crisp, bracing wine. But this one's surprisingly soft in the mouth, filling out with tropical fruit flavors that could use a bit more zest.
Made entirely from Chardonnay grapes grown in one site, the inaugural vintage of this cuvée is delicious. It offers a rich core of almond paste flavor, with inviting peach, apple and pear fruit tones, all while remaining light, bright and highlighted with wet stone and gravel.
Layers of rich white peach and pink grapefruit sweeten this delightfully piercing spätlase. It's dainty in mouthfeel, but sumptuously ripe, balanced by a bracing strike of acidity.
With Chardonnay from Provence the dominant partner in this blend with Burgundian Chardonnay, this wine is soft and unoaked, with melon and yellow fruit flavors. It has light acidity, enough to give the wine freshness. It is ready to drink.
Named for the proprietor/winemaker's favorite two roses, the flowers not the wine, this is indeed a wholly floral experience, subtle and delicately crafted to exude wild strawberry, orange and lime. Dry and refreshingly crisp in acidity, it's a light take on beautiful complexity.
This wine shows the rich, exotic flavors of tropical fruits, peaches, green apples and honeysuckle characteristic of Viognier. The finish is dry and crisp, ending with a hint of spice.
A touch creamy and lactic at first, but it picks up leathery, more rustic notes with airing. Flavors of plum, blackberry and broad-grained oak lead into a spicy finish with both cinnamon and tree-bark notes. Maybe it's a bit basic, but it's juicy, well made and tasty.
This appellation blend is nowhere near as amazing as the winery's single-vineyard expressions from this vintage, but it'll work for an everyday sipper. Light red cherry meets with damp herbs, wet hay and forest floor on the nose, while the simple palate combines red fruit with more herbs and orange peels.
Robust and round, this opens with aromas of dark berry, espresso and ground black pepper. The ripe palate offers mature blackberry, spicy plum and mocha alongside firm, velvety tannins. A note of bitter prune signals the close. It's not very complex but it's savory and calls out for food. Drink through 2016.
While scents of blueberry and blackberry preserves seem lush and ripe on the nose of this medium-bodied Lemberger, the palate is surprisingly bright and refreshing. Sour cherry acidity shines a spotlight on flavors of crisp raspberry and currant, finishing with a ruffle of soft, fine tannins.
Fresh red cherry aromas and crisp black cherry flavors carry this light-bodied, moderately tannic wine. Good acidity and those bright flavors will make it an easy pairing with different meat, fowl and pasta dishes.
Watery, with barely any flavor at all. If you try, you'll find some citrus fruit. But it's clean, dry and crisp in acidity, and serves a purpose at a decent price.
Both the golden color and the advanced nose signal a mature wine. The nose has a lifted quality that references white sultanas, dried pineapple, chalk and cooked champignons, with sumptuous, pleasantly bitter notes of dark fir honey. Contrary to expectation, the palate is merely off dry. It has an intriguing, almost salty quality with inflections of soy-sauce savoriness and immense depth of flavor. Still is sprightly and fresh, the wine has a streak of lemon freshness at its core. Lovely now and mature, it can be enjoyed until at least 2020.
Cabernet Sauvignon (45%) and Cabernet Franc (42%) take the lead on this blend. The aromas suggest notes of dried herb, cherry, vanilla and pencil shavings while the palate offers elegantly styled dark-fruit flavors with toasty accents. It's a very pretty expression of the vintage.
Very ripe, with a bite of raisin skin bitterness. But it's a lush wine, filled with chocolate, blueberry, blackberry jam and cedar flavors that go down nice and easy. Drink now.
Baked pear and sweet, baked apple make for an inviting opening. The same friendly duet plays on the off-dry palate all the way to the lingering finish. Along the way, there are highlights of zesty lemon and richer hints of honey and melon. It's simple, fun and even a little bit intriguing.
Short on aromatics, with only a whiff of pear and corn. The palate is soft and fleshy, with dry, limited papaya and melony flavors. Lettuce and other green notes carry the finish, which is bland and dilute. Will have a very short lifespan.
Strawberry fruit, framed in orange peel, characterizes this simple, yet enjoyable wine, from first sip to the last. It's forward and fruity, with a short tail.
Cloudy and a little stewy at first, which gives it a richer, plumper outward personality. With loads of earth and leather, fruit takes an early back seat before rising up in the form of black plum and berry. Finishes plump, with adequate structure. Gets better the more you get to know it.
Sangiovese is enhanced with a tiny quota of Canaiolo to produce a traditional-style Chianti Classic with high appeal and drinkability. In measured doses, you'll recognize black currant, mulberries and slate-like mineral flavors over a cool, fresh finish.
The estate belongs to the Borie family, one of the grand names of Bordeaux, with the wine making done by the team of Château Ducru-Beaucaillou in Saint-Julien. The result is an aromatic, balanced wine that is both structured and fruity. It has fine tannins, black currant fruit and a perfumed aftertaste.
With a pinkish hue, this wine has a healthy 21% addition of Sémillon. This contributes thick creaminess to its texture, built around well-defined flavors of vanilla, papaya and pear.
The delicate structure on this Pinot immediately appeals. It's all silk and satin, gliding across the palate with mouthwateringly crisp acidity that gets you ready for rich fare, like steak, tuna, lamb. A dried thyme earthiness suggests its warmer Napa origin, but the strawberry and cranberry fruit is evocative. Drink now.
Just a prickle of effervescence on the attack braces the palate for a shower of sweet lemon and apple flavors, with hints of fresh dill, white blossom and lime skin. Dry, lean and effortlessly elegant. Drink now.
Enticing scents of chamomile, white spring flower and white stone fruit mingle together in the glass. The creamy full-bodied palate doles out ripe honeydew melon, juicy yellow pear and nectarine zest while a ginger note adds depth. A far cry from the many bland Pinot Grigios that flood the market, this one is loaded with personality.
There's too much overripe fruit in this Zin, in the form of dried raisins. It's a fault, even though the taste isn't bad. The shriveled fruit yields bitter tannins from the grape skins.
Hearty and earthy aromas of elderberry, beet juice, smashed plums, black tea, chopped herbs and turned loam hit the nose on this blend of 75% Grenache, 12% Syrah, 10% Mourvèdre, 2% Carignane and 1% Counoise. Coffee leads the palate, but the deep purple fruits of boysenberry and olallieberry flourish alongside black pepper, leather and a beef jerky character.
An herbal red blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot, Merlot and Malbec, this is earthy, focused and straightforward.
This serviceable red blend includes smaller amounts of Merlot and Syrah, with tart red fruits and drying tannins. It dries out the mouth with a chalky sensation, suggesting it would be best enjoyed with red meat.
In contrast to the Artist Series Viognier, this is made entirely in stainless steel. It's quite soft, with ripe fruit flavors of peaches and apricots. There's a hint of vanilla spice as well.
This is an austere Chardonnay whose minerality and acidity star. That's not to say it's not fruity. It has pineapple and green apple flavors, with oak and lees adding richer complexities. Still, it's a firm, Chablis-style wine, and a very good one that defines the elegant sleekness of the Sonoma Coast.
A cool swathe of pine needles juxtapose ripe peach and waxy floral notes on this fragrant, delightfully layered Riesling. While dry and dainty on the palate, it's chock full of ripe, rich peach and mango flavors. The finish is endlessly long, fringed by a line of dusty minerals. It's refreshingly quaffable but substantial from nose to finish.
Here's a sunny rosé made near the beautiful town of Gaiole in Chianti. The blend is Sangiovese, Canaiolo, Malvasia and Trebbiano, and the wine offers both fresh fruit and floral aromas.
Made with 70% Cabernet Sauvignon and 30% Sangiovese, this supple, easy-drinking red offers pretty scents of fragrant purple flower and red berry. The round easygoing palate offers wild cherry and a hint of a red currant alongside bright acidity and soft tannins. Drink now.
Here's a bright, food-friendly bottling that offers raspberry, cherry and light spice aromas. The mouthful is lean and compact, and the wine shows a zesty vein of fresh acidity on the close.
Super floral, like lady's bath powder mixed with raspberry blossom. But that's where the pleasantries end; the palate is rubbery and hard as pavement, with gamy, cooked flavors that narrow down to a tough, tannic finish. Only 250 cases made, so it's more of an experimental wine than something commercial.
A dull Rhône-style blend, this is soft and hot with alcohol. You'll find some green vegetable and mushroom notes that mar the ripe flavors of red cherry jam.
This no-frills Merlot follows the general 14 Hands style of laying off the oak influence. It's a solid wine, though not particularly fruity, and it puts the emphasis on balanced notes of earth, herb and licorice.
This is a structured wine with its tight acidity and concentrated white and citrus fruits. Produced from a small parcel on the Chevalier estate, it is complex with its mineral texture, its touch of pepper and its fine herbal acidity. It is a wine for long-term aging. Drink from 2023.
Kind of earthy and mute, and also soft, with the flavor of canned fruit syrup, although it's fairly dry.
An earthbound white, with a rustic edge to it, while also having acidity and white fruits. A bitter almond character gives shape and texture.
Here's a real find: a serious-fun wine with lots going for it. Opens with black-cherry, smoke and vanilla aromas; rich and fine. The flavors are cherry-smoky and bone dry, with a fine texture. There's something distinguished and high quality about the structure and finish.
Light in body, but fresh and clean, this was a surprise performer in our last round of tastings. Herbal overtones to the cedar, cherry and tobacco notes are correct from a flavor standpoint, but note that this wine doesn't have the stuffing to pair with hearty, traditional Cabernet pairings.
Some wood aging for the Chardonnay in the blend of this mature vintage has given the wine its light toast and spice character. The wine is rich, smooth and generous with a full-bodied feel. It is now ready to drink.
Dry plum and cherry aromas seem hard and capped. The palate feels scratchy, with chunky berry flavors and a tough black-pepper finish. This is really basic in flavors and composition.
Gazza Ladra is a chalky, but almost sweet smelling expression of Fiano from southern Italy with aromas of candied lemon and honeysuckle. It's thin and compact with a bright touch of acidity on the close.
This is a hard Prosecco to score. You expect the soft freshness and peachy tones that normally define this category of Italian sparkler, yet here, you get a more sophisticated and slightly oxidized expression. The vintage bubbly is made with organically farmed grapes (no sulfites) and offers aromas of pear and apple cider. Not for everyone.
This is Cape Mentelle's biggest selling wine in the U.S., and one taste makes it clear why. It's got some of the herbal and passion fruit notes of Sauvignon Blanc, balanced by the strong citrus of Semillon. It's clean, crisp and long on the finish, with a lightly silky texture that lingers. Drink now.
The Looney Vineyard bottling is the outlier in the Archery Summit lineup—a different AVA and a non-estate vineyard. The Ribbon Ridge AVA is a subset of a subset within the Willamette Valley, and it may be the hidden gem for producing great Pinot Noir. This wine is sensual, spirited, spicy and smooth. The cherry and raspberry fruit is highlighted with bright acidity and whiffs of baking spices. The new oak is gently applied and the use of wild yeasts may have added some textural nuances also.
A rich style from winemaker Bill Brousseau, this shows smoked pork, plum, boysenberry and dashes of dried ginger on the nose. Rounded black-plum flavors arise on the palate then tighten toward elderberry, brisk cranberry, bay leaf and green peppercorn, altogether savory and tart.
This is a gamy wine that shows ripe fruit with a barnyard accent. It's quite full and forward with red berry flavors, bright acidity and a sense of structure.
Scratchy aromas of raspberry and licorice gumdrop precede a grabby, sticky palate with raw tannins. Plum and berry flavors are standard for Malbec, while the finish shows a mild baked character.
Very clean, smooth and inviting. Every piece is in place, and the wine flows from nose to palate to finish with ease and comfort. Flavors of black cherry, cassis and blackberry are creamy and deep, with a hint of vanilla sweetness and oak. Warm and chewy as well. Cabernet Sauvignon with 12% Cab Franc; drink now.
Particularly intense on the herbaceous front, the wine shows rich grapefruit and lemon zest flavors. Long, deep and delicious.
Jammy and murky smelling, and lacking clarity and zap on the nose. Surprisingly, the palate is jacked up with acidity, and thus it's sharp in the mouth and strained. Flavors of red fruits are made creamy by forced oak, yielding a milk chocolate note to the finish.
With a pretty onion skin color and delicate tones of bread dough, green apple, melon and bergamot, this is a wine to serve to a sophisticated audience on an elegant occasion. The fine mousse and persistent, dry finish are the perfect foil for tea sandwiches. Will gain complexity with three to four years aging.
A powerful dense wine that is rich and firmly structured, so it has big bold black fruit flavors that are still firmly embedded in dark tannins. It is a fine complex wine, the fruit of two of Ramos-Pinto's quintas in the Douro Superior. Keep this wine until 2018 at least. Celebrating its 25th anniversary in 2015, this brand was the among the first Douro still wines.
This opens with attractive earthy aromas of forest floor, cola, vanilla bean and toasted spice, grounded in a core of red currant, cherry and raspberry fruit. The medium-weight mouthfeel is lush and seductive, with fine yet structured tannins that result in a satiny texture. Pure fruit flavors dominate the palate, but the finish is layered with notes of white pepper, tea leaf and woody spice. Approachable now, but will age well through 2020.
Firm red currant and raspberry fruits dominate this smooth wine. The tannins, which lie underneath, give this round Pinot Noir essential firmness. This needs to age for 2–3 years.
Not as forward and lush as the appealing 2005, this all-purpose red, tasted a few months prior to its official release, is still knitting the components together. What is in place is plenty of tart, ripe raspberry fruit, precise and clean, and a soft backdrop of lightly chocolaty tannins.
This vineyard-designate offers a wealth and breadth of cherry compote and orange peel, alluring on both the nose and palate, with a light sprinkling of Asian spice. Full bodied, it carries itself with determined grace and finesse, enjoyable now and yet teasing in complexity. Drink now through 2024.
A new release for Concannon, this smallish release for the winery has honey, sweet vanilla, citrus and apricot, supported by a light, creamy mouthfeel. Finishing slightly sweet, with a coating of lemon, too, this would make a fine introduction to California Viognier for the novice.
A first for Lauren Ashton, this barrel-fermented Sémillon was sourced from the excellent Dineen Vineyard. It's firm and tightly packed with melon, jicama, pineapple and green banana fruit. Highlights of honeysuckle and lemon verbena are also in the mix. The finish is a little short, but more bottle age might well bump up the score.
Deep aromas of hibiscus, rose buds, dark red berries and sugar plums are spiced up by cola, crushed pencils and lots of garrigue on this bottling. The palate is clean and crisp, with snappy raspberry, light cranberry and lots more chaparral-like herbs, including wild thyme, bay laurel, lavender and fennel pollen.
Smells sharp and jammy and tastes tart and acidic, with jellied cherry flavors leading to a sugary finish.
It has a vivid ruby color, cherry and raspberry aromas and flavors, and good balance. It's not too fat, but medium bodied, with firm tannins that help frame the ripe fruit. It adds up to an elegant style.

Ripe fruit aromas give this wine its full-bodied feel. It has acidity and spicy tannins while the rich fruit theme continues. It should develop well and be ready from 2018.

Here's an elaborate and sophisticated Verdicchio Riserva from central Italy that sees ten months of oak aging for softness in the mouth and intensity of aromas.

Made overtly sweet, in the style of some Rosenblum wines, the Viognier, Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and Marsanne blend has sugary flavors of pineapples, peaches and apricots.
Dusty aromas of red cherry are muddled by oaky notes of plastic and latex. A jumpy, bright palate is rudimentary, as are lightly spiced plum and raspberry flavors. A fresh, dry, basic finish seems appropriate.
Toughly rustic, with dried berry and leather flavors and a firm backbone of astringent tannins. You'll taste some red currants in the finish.
Jenkins is a Charlie Chenoweth-farmed site, an 18-acre vineyard in the Sebastopol Hills. Spicy acidity cradles considerable weight and breadth, accented in rose petals, cardamom and an elusive partnership of raspberry and strawberry. It's entirely exotic and delicious, both concentrated and lush.
Made light and bright, this wine combines 56% Viognier with 22% Roussanne and 22% Marsanne. The three varieties are fermented in stainless steel to preserve the lean linear characteristics of lemon and lime that wrap around crisp tight acidity, the entirety buoyant in floral honeysuckle.
A beautifully balanced wine, its acidity blending easily with the fresh fruits, toast and rich texture. There is a high mineral content, but this fits well into the white fruits, lime zest and final freshness.
Chewy, minty and firm, with full-bodied flavors of apricot and peach. The fleshy fruit is enhanced with sur lies aging in 40% new French oak barrels.
Fresh, fruity and juicy, this is a red cherry flavored wine that has brought out the best of the light 2013 vintage. It is soft with only the lightest of tannins and refreshing acidity at the end.

A combination of savory and herbal red-fruit aromas set up a flat-feeling palate with little to no textural variation. Flavors of baked berry, oak spice and herbs finish blocky and a touch green.
La Cala is a fresh and vibrant expression of Vermentino that shows bright notes of lime and lemongrass backed by peach and honeydew melon. That natural freshness will pair perfectly with fried foods or calamari rings.
A tasty Sauvignon Blanc, with crisply acidic grapefruit, pineapple and lime juice flavors, touched with oak. A nice appetizer sipper, with some complexity. Good with asparagus risotto, bruschetta with goat cheese, a nice roast chicken with sautéed new potatoes and rosemary.
Cherry and plum aromas come with a note of rubbery latex, like a Band-Aid. This feels compact and dense, as if the palate were balled up. Medicinal black cherry and chocolate flavors finish in a bunched blocky mass.
One of the top, if not the top, red wines from Umbria. The naturally tannic Sagrantino grape is softened by the careful oak aging that adds layers of chocolate and spice to the grape's aromas of black cherry, tobacco and leather. This is bold, powerful, masculine and velvety on the finish. Pair it with stewed or grilled meat marinated in rosemary and garlic. Age this in a cellar for 10 years or longer.

The pineapple and Golden Delicious aromas are right on target, and are followed by apple and mildly oaky flavors. An easy texture and smooth finish with mild spice notes close this crowdpleaser.
Opens with a drying mineral note that squarely frames sweeter aromas of stone fruit, melon, honey and white spring flower. It's an informal, compact sparkler with bright acidity and a tonic, firm close.
Too sweet. Whether that's because of leftover sugar, high alcohol or both, this Zin is more like a Porty dessert wine. It's delicious and rich, but the sweetness has to be counted as a defect.
Young and lush, this wine has strong purple fruit flavors, aromas of creamy vanilla, lemony oak and leather, with moderate tannins and spice to support. Pinotage can age, but this comes across as forward and fruity, so the best bet is to enjoy it now. Imported by Dreyfus, Ashby & Co.

Ripe Mirabelle plums and tart, red apples mix to give a very fruity, appetizing aspect which on the palate is joined by ripe, lemony freshness.

Lovely Mirabelle finish of immense length. Drink 2016–2026.

Robert Mondavi winemaker Genevieve Janssens makes this wine, a small-production solo project that's worth seeking. The 83% Cabernet Sauvignon is sourced from Hendry Ranch and the 17% Cabernet Franc from Detert East Vineyard, a stone's throw from To Kalon. Impressively concentrated and lengthy, within a wealth of power, it is nuanced in black cherry, leather saddle and crushed rock, with the scent of violet never far behind.
Ruinart's Blanc de Blancs is structured and intensely minerally, but with a rich, full, creamy palate. It is finely balanced—elegant yet fruity—with a bright, crisp aftertaste. Drink now.
A good rosé, fruity and spicy and crisp in acids. It's a bit on the sweet side, but otherwise offers pleasant flavors of strawberries, raspberries, herb tea and spices.

Lightly toasty notes lead the nose of this wine, along with herb, green apple and citrus rind aromas. The palate is quite elegant in style, needing only a bit more concentration to truly shine.
This hits 15.5% alcohol—amazingly high for a Columbia wine. The tart red fruit is offset with sweet grain and dried herbs, almost like an old vine Zin from northern California. Somehow the herbs overmatch the berry flavors, which seem a bit on the light side, despite the high alcohol. Young vines?
Somebody picked early, to judge from the slightly green, peppercorn notes. But in a way that adds to the complexity, and makes the wine different. It's not a fruit bomb, it's a coffee, herb and blackberry-flavored dry Merlot with structural integrity.
Woody and baked up front, its cooked, rubbery aromas setting set up a surprisingly sheer and sharp palate that's short on substance and balance. Tastes generic, with linear acidity resulting in little cushion or mouthfeel.
For $9, one can be satisfied with the value, but this wine does smell a bit sour and herbal, while the feel is angular and acidic. In the mouth, flavors match suit: punchy red fruits with an herbal twinge.
As per usual, Toso's regular varietal Malbec is pleasing, honest and shows the variety in its best, affordable form. Meaty and rich on the nose, with an inky accent. The palate has the right feel and solid flavors of blackberry and raspberry. Competently covers the spectrum of aromas, feel and flavors.
From the Roux family's own vines in Vougeot, this is an intense statement of dark tannins and firm fruit. The wine sits solidly in the glass, giving a dry core, surrounded by sweet plum juice flavors. In 5–6 years, it will have developed well.

Brambly berry fruits are rounded out with smooth tannins and some barrel toast, from 10 months in 30% new French oak. This is a most enjoyable wine, though it feels a bit diffuse, rather than tightly focused.
89-91 Ripe, soft fruit, the tannin right within the sweetness. It has density without weight, an opulent, ripe wine.
This is from the premium range produced by the Winzer Krems cooperative. It is a freshly fruity, bramble-flavored wine, lifted with acidity, light flavors of wood and a good, fresh, juicy, spicy aftertaste.
Jacaman's basic county-wide Pinot isn't as good as their Anderson Valley or Russian River bottlings, but it's not as expensive. Shows a good grasp of Pinot essentials, with a silky texture framing cherry, cola and spice flavors.
A finely perfumed wine, touched with wood, Beaujolais in a Burgundy style, structured and with intense acidity. It is packed with firm tannins, surrounded by a lively cherry and rich fruit character.
This wine brings fine Bordeaux to mind, with aromas of eucalyptus and mint, black currant flavor and firm tannin, and a finish of forest floor. But it's also its own wine, with leather accents, a big, silky body, tart berry and cola, and a warm finish.
A classic blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, this has a steely texture, fresh acidity and lively flavors of sliced apple and citrus with a tangy orange zest texture. It is bright and a bit taught now, so give it a little time to harmonize; try in 2015.
Superrich in pineapple, lime, kiwi and tropical fruit flavors, this lovely Chardonnay has a rich, balanced overlay of sweet, smoky oak. A blend of Lynmar's various vineyards, the wine's brisk acidity and minerality shine through, making the richness bright and clean. A brilliant Chardonnay to drink now.
91–93. Barrel sample. A fine, dense, opulent wine with a great sense of structure. It's dark and solid with tannins that are dense, dusty and brooding. It's likely to age well.
Meaty plum and Band-Aid aromas are less than exact but not bad or false for Pinot Noir. This feels a bit thick and gummy, while dense, spicy plum flavors finish mildly bitter as this winds its way down.
It's scented with a pretty mix of sandalwood, toasted cracker and blackberry jam, and the flavors follow into tart berry and black cherry. There's noticeable acid and some interesting grace notes, suggestive of flint and gun metal. The flavors linger pleasantly in the back of the throat. This is not a fleshy merlot by any means, but it is polished and evocative, and I like the suggestions of rock and iron ore that it has captured with the black cherry fruit.
A fluorescent pink color introduces this soft, full and fruity wine with fine, balanced acidity. There is a touch of caramel, along with crisp acidity from red-cherry flavors. Ready to drink. Screwcap.
A fairly deep-red color, aromas like plums and roses, and flavors like sweet peaches and cherries combine for a delicious sweet wine. It's light in alcohol, lightly effervescent and well balanced.
Soft and melted in structure, with simple cherry and red currant flavors tinged with herbs and steamed broccoli.

Rich, ripe and classy, this shows real pedigree in its structure, with brisk acids, firm tannins and a hint of minerals providing the architecture for the cherry and pomegranate flavors. It finishes totally dry and is ready to drink now.

Penetrating aromatically, spicy and complex, this brings in sharp berry scents, baking chocolate and a streak of herb. It's tight and vertically structured, and once in the mouth it turns a bit hard and unyielding. But it lingers and resonates, improves after being open for several hours, and can be cellared for up to a decade.
Will appeal to those who like a drier, leaner Cabernet, with slightly green herb flavors of blackberries, cassis and minerals. The sweet finish is a good indication of ageability, but its a hard wine to predict.
Lively and crisp, this wine hints more at fragrant red berries and red fruit than the tannins of Cabernet. The structure is there, but in the background, giving the wine a chance at a couple of years' bottle aging.
Opening with an alluring fragrance of acacia flower, Spanish broom and beeswax, this boasts fleshy peach and juicy pineapple flavors, along with mineral notes and a drop of honey. It has lovely depth and should evolve more complexity over the next 2–3 years.
Dark and rubbery on the nose, with a slight pickle-and-olive accent but mostly black fruit aromas. Juicy and also stout in terms of feel, with blackberry and herbal flavors. Finishes with a touch of buttery oak, chocolate and toast.
This is full of ripe raspberry flavor that is cut with lively acidity. It is a delicious, fruity, apéritif-style rosé with just a touch of zesty texture to tighten it up.
Chunky rubbery aromas of black plum form the first act. This feels big and wide, with grabby tannins. Flavors of toast, burnt oak, licorice and blackberry finish woody and with scratchy tannins.
Labeled a “Super Tuscan-Style Blend” this is 36% Syrah, 45% Sangiovese and 18% Cabernet Sauvignon, all from Red Mountain vineyards. It opens gracefully with pretty raspberry and cherry fruit, then grounds itself in a base of mineral and earth, enlivened with natural acidity.
Tropical in style and approach, this rich wine dotted in pineapple and papaya drinks bigger than it is, veering into very ripe flavor and texture.

Upfront aromas of cocoa, vanilla, sawdust and savory herb are followed by flavors of plum, cherry and barrel spice. The oak and fruit play equal roles, with the flavors a bit dialed back.
Made from what Californians call the Pommard clone, this has a light, traditional garnet color. Fresh and lively fruit aromas resemble cranberries and red cherries, followed by tangy fruit and cinnamon flavors of medium intensity, supported by firm acidity and moderate tannins.
Pale lemony color. Classic Mosel nose of stone, slate, white peach and flower blossoms. Vibrant and crisp, balancing the sweetness on the palate and resulting in a wine with a juicy texture and moderate intensity, turning racy on the finish. Not overly complex, but refined.
Vigorous and tannic, this young Pinot is hard right now. It also seems a little unbalanced, with some raisins and mint bracketing the cherries. Could just be going through an awkward youth. Try in 2011.
The bitter-edged sweetness of botrytis counters the luscious notes of orange marmalade. The palate is of immense richness and has a tart gilded richness of candied orange peel and a concentrated pleasant bitterness that is so addictive. There are glints of white pepper. The purest citrus acid runs like a fault line through the wine. This is lovely and luscious now but really made to last. This will age and develop indefinitely. Drink now until 2030 at least.

Bright aromas of ripe strawberry and raspberry are followed by more delicate tones of peach and pink grapefruit. This is an easy, no-fuss rosé sparkler with a lean finish and bright acidity. Try it with chicken quesadillas.
There are dashes of exotic spice and ash that permeate into the lavish stonefruit and waxy flower notes on the nose and palate. This is complex and intensely juicy; the brisk acidity and crushed gravel notes add a clean, minerally edge.
This is a high acid, dry and minerally Chardonnay that you can call Chablisian. It has flavors of grilled lemons, limes and pineapples, with richer notes of sweet oak and lees and the buttered toast of oak. Defined by elegance, it should develop bottle complexities over the next three or four years.
This is 98% Syrah, unlike past vintages where it was modeled after a Côtes du Rhône-style blend. It opens with enticing whiffs of soft leather and toasted nut, before bringing in a smooth mix of black and purple fruits, along with chocolate and anise highlights. It's supple and proportionate, with polished, coffee-flavored tannins.
This is a nice, lower-priced option of the variety, spicy in raspberry and strawberry, with a medium-built weight. Bulky in tannins that soften in the glass, its simplicity doesn't dete. There's a lasting note of toasted oak on the wine as it winds down.

Very opulent, almost too much so, with a flood of Key lime pie, pineapple jam, orange, butterscotch and buttered toast flavors that overwhelm in richness. The saving grace is a fine structure of acidity and minerals and a finish that strives to be dry. Drink now with shellfish, roast pork, or all alone as an apéritif.
With a sense of structure and balance between honey and fruit, this is an attractive, food-friendly wine. It is off dry although the spice core gives a drier edge. Allow the wine a few more months in bottle; drink from late 2015.

This is a robust and firmly structured Syrah with medium-coarse tannins and medium-full weight. Meaty and dark with notes of licorice, black currant, sweet spice and a touch of cocoa on the finish. Though it's intense, it still feels like it's holding back a little bit; try after 2012 for a more forward presentation.
An opening salvo of honey and white fruits is solid as can be. The palate rolls out dry, angular citrus, pineapple and apple flavors in front of a finish that's naturally fresh and nutty. A bubbly with no muss, fuss or confusion. Best if you like ‘em dry.

Lean and focused, with powerful mineral notes reminscent of crushed stones balancing lime and honey. This is crisp and racy, nearly taut in its construction, yet elegantly wrought. Drink now-2020.
This wine shows the riper, spicier side to German Pinot Noir. Lush black cherry and plum flavors are fleshy and dense on the palate, tinged with notes of cassis and bramble. Crisp acidity adds elegance and structure, along with a penetrating layer of finely textured tannins. Drink now for its bold, decadent style.
Not a bad wine, but too soft-heavy and sweet for my tastes, with cherry flavors that are on the medicinal side due to the very high alcohol. Almost 90% charry new oak doesn't really help.

Lots of bacon, leather and earth coat the nose of this vanguard-style Rioja, but unlike the spectacular 2001, the '02 is not nearly as deep and ethereal.

Imported by Jorge Ordoñez/Fine Estates from Spain.
Very jammy, it has gentle, soft tannins, and strawberry fruits. It's fresh without any structure.

Ornato boasts the best of Barolo tradition and ushers forth all the seductive aromas we normally associate with Nebbiolo: spice, sweet chocolate, dried herbs, cured meats and mineral notes all make an appearance. This brightly luminous wine is bold and sophisticated with lingering tones of coffee, plum and prune. Drink after 2015.
Similar in style to the winery's Cuvée A bottling, this had a little higher percentage of new French oak (still just one quarter total), and brings an earthier style to bear. The cherry fruit has scents and subtle flavors of compost and barnyard, with ripe but chewy tannins.

Rich, dense and cool, with an overt menthol streak. The fat, tangy fruit has a cedar edge and also a pronounced piercing quality. Round, voluminous, tannic and in general quite big. Now the wood is a bit heavy-handed. A year or two on its side should help it along.
Packs a punch with peach, honey and wildflower aromas and flavors, as well as various spice and vanilla.  It's smoothly textured, with good acids and a sprightly mouthfeel, and finishes long and sweetly ripe.

Almost searingly fresh, this is a wine that demands fish. The acidity is dominant, cutting through the grapefruit and green fruit flavors. With its tight texture, this could age for a few more months, but it will be great this summer.

All indigenous grapes are welcomed by our tasting panel, but sometimes they are unknown and little used for a reason.

It feels vibrant, elegant and complex in the mouth, a wine to savor over multiple glasses.
It's rare to see a varietal bottle of Petit Verdot come out of this appellation, let alone a single vineyard offering but this one clearly deserves it. The aromas of flowers, soil, green herbs and purple fruit are light and brooding and lead to full but in balance black-fruit flavors. A lengthy finish caps it off.
Pure Merlot, with muscle and sharp tannins. The scent suggests butter and caramel, but the wine itself has more herb and earth flavor than barrel or grape.

Aromas of prunes and figs introduce a big, thick, chewy Cabernet with plenty of fruit power. Black raspberry, black cherry and black currant fruits swirl through layers of smoky wood. Tannins are quite astringent and drying.

With a light brick color and thin mouthfeel, this wine seems to be past its prime. The mild nose offers nuances of small tart berries, rhubarb and a hint of pepper. The palate shows more of the same, with flavors of red currant and strawberry hull.

Soft, sweet and gluey. A hard wine to like despite rich raspberry and mocha flavors.
Well-ripened, with an almost candied flavor of cherries, raspberries and peppermint, but it feels dry and crisp. Finishes with a rich, smooth tannic structure.
A touch of buttered popcorn is in the aroma. Rich toasty flavors give an assertive, attractive oaky personality to this medium-bodied wine made from Chenin Blanc, Roussanne and Viognier that was aged in older oak barrels. It has a broad smooth texture, a good layering of butter, spice and pear-tart flavors, and a lingering finish.
While this is a Moscato, it's unlike most of the Moscatos out there on the market. For one thing, it's bone dry. Without the distracting taste of honey, you can really taste the underlying citrus fruits and white flowers, as well as a stimulating minerality. The acidity is excellent.
This is a deeper, earthier style of Pinot, clearly from a cool climate. You'll find plenty of cherries, but there are mulchy, mushroomy notes, veering into rhubarb, as well as some tannins. The mouthfeel is silky and light, and the wine is very dry.
Softly floral and sculpted in red berry and leather, this extracted and somewhat reduced wine may need time in the glass, if not the bottle, to open. The brawnier tendencies reign in full dominance and weight.

Aromas of menthol, blue flower and dark berry lift out of the glass. The tannic palate is still primary, offering tart sour cherry and star anise while a hint of dried sage closes the firm finish.
Like most Tardieu Laurent wines, this is lushly textured stuff. Honey and peach notes mingle easily on the nose and in the mouth, fading out just a little too quickly on the finish. Drink now.
There's a dark and moody feel to this wine, with moderately intense aromas of black plum, blackberry, violet and black licorice. The mouth is robust and fairly full with a creamy texture and concentrated black fruit flavors accented by notes of pepper and tea leaves.

A soft, somewhat simple wine, with earthy flavors of cherries, herbs and oak. Easy to drink with everyday fare.

The vineyard is in the Green Valley, and the acidity is very high, giving a bright purity to the kiwi, Key lime pie, pineapple custard and crème brûlée flavors. Lots of toasty new French oak and lees bring super creaminess to the mouthfeel. White Burgundy is the model, expressed California-style.
This wine is Cabernet Sauvignon (72%) and Syrah (30%), with the fruit hailing from both River Rock and Jack's vineyards. Aromas of green herbs, peat, mineral, cherry and spice are followed by smoke, olive and other savory flavors. It shows polish and impeccable balance from start to finish.
Meat, bacon and plum skin aromas are followed by dense, ripe tannins, piled on by black, solid fruits. This is a powered, intense wine, with superrich fruit, but encased in dry tannins.

A very good Pinot for drinking now. With a silky-smooth mouthfeel, it has rich flavors of raspberries, cherries, cola, anise, cinnamon and sweet smoky oak. Delicious and savory.
Larry McKenna continues to show his masterful touch with Martinborough Pinot with his latest release.

Black cherry, cigarbox, pepper and mocha give this vclvety red class. Sultry, integrated and unfolding, the wine offers additional warming spice, cinnamon and chocolate on the palate. Mellow black fruits and a delicious cinnamon finish seal the deal.
Tar and black fruit loll on the full-bodied palate here, the wine well composed to highlight dark, leathery cigar and a hint of cedar. Smooth and round on the finish, it's a varietal rarity for the appellation.
Intense youthful Sauvignon, this is all about lemon, pink grapefruit and acidity. A textured quality gives an orange-zest character while still letting the bright fruit speak freshly and easily.

Rich and dark, with full, smooth tannins, this big wine explodes with flavors of tar, cassis, plum and integrated oak.

A stellar wine from the premier red wine area in South Africa. Imported by Cape Classics.
Dry, mild, dusty berry aromas are simple but correct for the variety. This feels scattered across the palate, with some stickiness. Resiny, oaky, buttery flavors of generic berry fruits finish short, with a mild but lasting green note.
Lightly scented with citrus blossom and orchard fruit, this racy white offers up delicate flavors of yellow apple and lemon zest. It's linear, with vibrant acidity that leaves a crisp finish.
This is a dense and rich wine full of black plum fruits, rich tannins and a dark structure. It has great potential. Drink from 2016.

Basic apple aromas are fresh and clean. This Viura is healthy and clearly defined, but simple all the way through. Lightly pickled citrus flavors finish steady.
This is a Merlot-based, Bordeaux-style blend, with a leafy, herbal aspect that reflects the cooler vintage. It plays out broadly across the palate, with scents of violets and vanilla, and flavors of wild berry and light herb.
Tasted in February, 2014, this Pinot was showing a slight effervescence, not unpleasant, but considered a flaw. The spritziness might calm down with a few more months in the bottle. The wine itself is dry, silky and solid in cola, raspberry jam, orange peel and sandalwood flavors.
Attractive, mild floral and white-pepper aromas and flavors show in this even, light sparkler, but a weird element somewhere between underripe vegetables and a chemical note detracts considerably.  It's soft on the palate and closes with modest length, the good and bad elements struggling for the upper hand on the finish.

Melon, pear and sweet citrus lead the bouquet, with nuances of orange blossom and honeysuckle, while spicy flavors of baked apple, glazed canteloupe and lightly-mulled pear flood the palate. Round and forward, with a silky texture; give it time to open up now or hold another couple of years.

This grape is still finding its way to consistency in California, and this bottling combines interesting black raspberry and reductive tar notes. It's light in body, with red raspberry fruit flavors and pencil shaving accents. Best served with food, since it doesn't offer a lot of compelling character on its own.

Plump, mouthfilling and sweet, this is an easy-to-appreciate auslese loaded with fruit-driven flavor.

This Bordeaux-style blend of 35% Merlot, 38% Cabernet Franc, 25% Cabernet Sauvignon and 2% Petit Verdot is sharp-edged, with high-toned aromas of raspberry, strawberry and cherry. The underlying acidity brings a streak of citrus, and there are also light suggestions of barnyard and toast. It's a balanced and interesting wine, best consumed over the next few years.

Black-currant aromas lead to a wine that has plenty of fruit even though it is masked by tannins at this stage. It's just in bottle after a year in oak barrels. So it is dry for now and will broaden out and bring in the black fruits as it develops. Drink from 2019.
Nice Tempranillo for $10. Paso a Paso opens with blackberry, boysenberry and other black-fruit aromas. But it's composed and doesn't smell artificial or candied.

This is the first release of this designation. The vintage was warm and ripe, and the vineyard is hard by the Sonoma border but in Napa. It's an interesting wine.

Floral and tropical aromas are a direct reflection of the 75% Torrontés in the blend. There's also lychee, another Torrontés byproduct.

Contains 15% Viognier and 10% Chardonnay.
For ten bucks, you really can't go wrong with this Grenache-dominated blend.

From old Alvarinho vines, this wine was fermented in wood to round it out and give extra richness. The wine certainly is full-bodied, intensely fruity, packed with apricot as well as citrus flavors.

Drink 2017–2025.

This is a real heavyweight. At 15.4% alcohol it tastes and smells like Port, and it has a flat and chewy palate of raisin, baked black fruit and licorice candy. Basically, there's just no edge or balance to this mammoth, overripe fruit ball.
For fans of mineral, slate-driven Rieslings, this should be a hit. The aromas are of dusty slate, while the wine's flavors add petrol notes to the impression of liquid slate. Unlike many Mosel wines, there's not much in the way of fruitiness, despite the wine's plumpness. Imported by Chapin Cellars, LLC.
Rocca's bright and youthful Morellino would make the perfect pairing partner to pizza or easy tomato pasta. The wine is smooth and crisp with loads of fresh cherry on the close.
Aromas of forest floor, game and ripe berry come together on the nose. The earthy palate delivers dried black cherry, clove, smoke, baked plum and aniseed alongside chewy tannins. Drink through 2016.
With a persistence of lightly-toasted oak, this youthful wine offers intense luxury. A gritty, stony texture complements its delicious aspects of lemon rind and anise. Green apple, ocean spray and an underlying streak of dried herb provide additional complexity and length.
Chehalem makes four different Rieslings, and this is often the best of them. Rich and complex, it's dense with grapefruit, lemon, lime, apple and flavors of wet stone. Lovely in the mouth, it lingers gracefully through the finish.
A gritty, full-force bouquet is oaky, slightly lactic smelling, crusty and a little green. This blend of Carmenère and Malbec is mouthfilling, with tartaric bite and jumpy flavors of raspberry, plum and herbs. On the finish, it's herbal and mildly green like on the nose, with toughness.
Scented with some musky, dusty notes of light cinnamon and a hint of the barnyard, this brings thin berry fruit, baking spices and clove together. It shows some interesting complexity, but fades quickly into a dilute finish.
The wine tastes young, its fruits and wood characters not quite integrated. But it has a good light touch of redcurrants and blackberries to go with the acidity. The wood gives dry tannins and a firm structure.
You don't want to open this wine anytime soon. It's tightly wound and immature, offering a blast of primary fruit flavors that haven't yet integrated with the oak. It tastes almost sweet now, although it's technically bone dry, with waves of black cherries, blackberries, mocha, anise liqueur and smoky oak vanillins, followed by a long, spicy finish. Hold until 2012, if you can, and should drink well beyond that.
A great value wine, Cusumano's cheerful Syrah is aged in stainless steel to lock in its fresh berry nuances. The wine's texture is clean and simple, but nicely smooth and soft as well.
This wine has potent berry, funky earth and herb aromas. Its fruity-floral flavors are tinged with a balsamic nip and a tart, rather tannic mouthfeel. To taste a little pioneering in terms of wine style, don't be alarmed at the sediment in the bottle.
One of Italy's most iconic bottlings, the 2012 Sassicaia is drop-dead gorgeous. A blend of 85% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% Cabernet Franc, it boasts sensations of blue flowers, cedar, juicy red currants, ripe raspberries, white pepper and a balsamic note. Structured, radiant and loaded with finesse, it delivers everything you'd expect from a world-class wine and more. Drink 2018–2032.
Under the control of Bernard Magrez, this has become the largest of the Saint-Emilion grand cru vineyards. The wines are in a modern, dense style, with power-packed fruit, high extract and huge, solid tannins. For a 2002, this is a big wine.
With its toast and vanilla flavors, balanced with notes of green apple and plum, this is an attractive, ready-to-drink wine that rolls ripely around the mouth.
Bigger, richer, oaken and more structured than T-L's regular Châteauneuf-du-Pape, this cuvée flirts with being just too much. Vanilla, cedar and plum cake aromas, licorice, plum, and cocoa on the palate have a lot to recommend them, while the muscular midpalate and firmness of the tannins on the finish suggest agreeability but not much charm. Try after 2020?
A masterpiece from this near perfect vintage. Completely ripe, classic and fresh, with oodles of red cherry and blackcurrant flavors that are generously oaked. Amazingly, the wine is still young and tannic. So beautifully structured, so smooth and polished, firm yet soft, just a gorgeous wine. Hold onto it until at least 2012, if you can.
This medium-bodied Shiraz is sturdily built without being too hard or too fat. Sure, it's a bit simple, relying on black cherry and plum fruit with modest hints of chocolate and spice, but there's plenty of intensity for the price.
This is as perfumed an example of Syrah as you'll find from the Southern Rhône. Hints of herbs, spice and violets accent blueberry fruit in this charming wine. It's medium in body—not that rich but or layered but supple, silky and easily accessible. Drink this through the end of 2015.
Easy going and well priced, this light Fiano is an informal companion to summertime foods. Aromas here include peach, citrus and mineral and the wine is sharp and clean on the close.
Knights Valley continues to be a fine spot for this variety, as evidenced by this wine, which is extremely vibrant in grassy lemon zest and melon. A pure expression of the grape, it offers enough oomph to remain consistent and textured, ending with a succulent suggestion of apricot.
Simple, no frills, lightly tasting of wild blackberries, this every- day Cabernet Sauvignon mixes in small amounts of Syrah, Merlot and a splash of Lemberger. It is crisp, varietal, and well-balanced.
Heavy aromas of baked berry fruits and raisin suggest a bit of overripeness. On the palate, that take is confirmed by chunky weight offset by natural acidity. Flavors of oak barrel, raisin and tart plum cover a wide spectrum, while this blend of Garnacha, Tempranillo and Carignan finishes long, with black-fruit flavors. Drink now.
Here's a nicely evolved Brunello with earthy tones that are often associated with the Sangiovese Grosso grape. You'll get dried berry, blackberry, exotic spice and a playful touch of bacon fat that adds dimension and depth. The wine is thick and hearty on the palate, so try a pairing with lamb or game meat.
This has the plush texture and gorgeously ripe tannins that Napa Cabs   specialize in. It's a little on the thin side, fruit-wise, with pleasant blackberry and oak flavors. Drink now.
A touch prickly and odd at first, with cactus and canned peaches on the nose. More canned, sweet fruit appears on the palate, which is soft and modest from front to finish. Ends with the flavor of pineapple Lifesavers.
A new offering from this producer, this wine blends 55% Malbec with 15% Zinfandel, 12% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Petite Sirah and 8% Merlot. It satisfies in rich, rounded flavors of blueberry pie, cranberry and clove, with an underlying streak of dark chocolate. Medium acidity supports an appealing full-bodied juiciness.
A blend of 70% Nero d'Avola and 30% Nocera from the extreme tip of northeastern Sicily, this offers enticing scents of violet, red berry and Mediterranean brush. The bright, juicy palate doles out ripe black cherry, crushed raspberry, chopped herb and a note of ground pepper alongside fresh acidity and round, polished tannins. Drink through 2019.
This opens with unusual charred aromas and whiffs of resin. The palate retains the same burnt sensations alongside notes of roasted coffee bean and bitter walnut husk. It lacks fruit richness and ends on an astringent note that dries out the mouth.
This medium-bodied Zinfandel has a lighter color than many, but plenty of aroma and flavor. It smells like a wild blackberry patch in summer, tastes like strawberry jam and goes down smooth due to its light tannins and a touch of sweetness.
Light in color and body, with dry flavors of cherries, cola and vanilla oak. Feels soft and simple, but not bad for the price.
A pretty onion-skin colored wine, this has soft texture, light acidity and a warm, rounded character. Tart red currants provide freshness and crispness to a palate that's weighty and concentrated with flavor. A finely balanced wine that can be drunk now.
Originally made to celebrate the 50th wedding anniversary of the late Count Giuseppe Tasca d'Almerita and his wife Franca, this brilliantly pure and fresh wine remains one of Sicily's favorite whites—especially when paired with the island's abundant seafood. There's great purity and intensity of aromas here: from peach, apricot, kiwi and lemon blossom to crisp, drying mineral notes.
An earthy if slightly reserved nose offers mushroom and iron aromas on this bottling by the single-vineyard experts in Los Gatos. The wine comes alive on the sip, with bergamot, black tea, bay leaves, Greek spice and thyme decorating the woody elderberry fruits.
A sturdy, slightly chunky wine, the 2008 Swan Pinot Noir features ample black cherry and plum fruit, and complementary coffee-tinged oak. With its dark color and assertive flavors, it's certainly trying hard. Drink now–2015.
Dark in color, this wine offers reserved aromas of smoke, tobacco, red fruit, crème de cassis, flowers, exotic spice and funk. The palate is plush and forward but still light on its feet, showing energy and focus. Fruit and savory flavors persist on the finish, demonstrating exquisite balance.
Lots of pleasure in this dry, classically structured wine. It's rich and forward in juicy blackberries and cherries, with a milk chocolaty richness but also a dried herb earthiness that grounds it. Good price for a wine of this class.
A medium-bodied, well rounded Sauvignon Blanc, this is tropical and citrusy, with passion fruit leading the way and not too much herbaceousness. It's easy to drink, finishing with hints of ripe stone fruits.
87-89 There is certainly good fruit here, it is quite light, delicate and layered with tannins and acidity. This is a fresh, fruity style, but with all the right characteristics.
Elusively crisp and inviting on the nose, this is a thickly intriguing wine, floral in orange blossom and fresh apple. Structured and lengthy, it retains a tangy acidity and structured finish, the grapes sourced from a dry-farmed vineyard.
Made with Carignano grapes, Grotta Rossa is a simple, fruity red wine with jammy notes of strawberry, prune and plum. Natural spice tones are woven within (although this wine sees no oak) for an easy and fresh-tasting ensemble.
Bold and flavorful without feeling overtly ripe or sweet, this wine has a lot to say. It's complex and spicy, smelling of cardamom, nutmeg and rosemary—a possible result of its 25% whole-cluster fermentation. Red cherry, rhubarb and pomegranate flavors are bracing and fresh, while the texture is firm and moderately tannic. It's cellarable and will be best after 2018.
This is a classic style of Cabernet that should improve with age. It smells like pencil shavings, tobacco and cedar, and tastes like dark chocolate and black cherry, while feeling very firm on the palate. It has fine-grained tannins, and a lingering dark chocolate and cherry finish. It will be best after 2018.
Aromas of wheat and straw are leesy and show little fruit. Seeing that this is from 2007, the fruit hit the road years ago; what's left is acidity, leesy hints, stone-fruit notes and peach-pit bitterness. With the right food and on the right occasion, this will work well. Otherwise, it's a novelty. Drink through 2018.
Fermented in a neutral barrel, this Roussanne brings praline and grilled peach into the mix. Weighty and flabby in feel, an overripe fruit character resounds on the palate.
Aromas suggesting underbrush, toast, ripe plum, dark spice, menthol and Mediterranean herb waft out of the glass. On the bold, polished palate, velvety tannins support juicy Morello cherry, blackberry jam, licorice, coffee and a chocolate note. It's already accessible and will make for fine drinking over the next few years. Drink through 2021.
This is a crisp, lightly perfumed wine with attractive apple acidity and touches of grapefruit. The texture is soft, with a bright aftertaste. Drink now.
A wine that is fruity, with just a light texture from green herbs and cherry skins. Good acidity cuts through the fruitiness and banana flavor at the end. Drink now.
A winner given its quality-to-price quotient. This smells earthy, dark and harmonious, with black plum and berry aromas leading the charge. It feels racy, juicy and full, with giant raspberry, plum, vanilla, tobacco and licorice flavors. It's textured on the finish, with bright, lasting flavors. Drink now.
This new “i” series offering mixes brambly strawberry fruit with granular tannins. It's ready to drink, dappled with cinnamon, and leaves a slightly medicinal aftertaste in the back of the mouth.
This is one of the most delicious rosé Champagnes around, a gorgeous vibrant red currant- and pink grapefruit-dominated wine. It's ripe, but so well balanced, its acidity merging into a fine creaminess. It is a wine that is lively, vivid, but remaining dry.
This has aromas suggesting grilled herb, toasted oak, espresso and a whiff of wet animal fur. The palate offers dried cherry, game, anisette and a green note of bitter sage alongside extremely astringent tannins.
A full wine that shows a richness, spice and a soft texture. While it is dry, it misses acidity and feels fat.
Full and ripe with broad aromas of jasmine, cooked apple and lilies, this wine gets a twist from brown spice on the nose. The rich palate reflects a touch of cinnamon sprinkled on baked apples, along with flint, sandstone, pineapple and a smoky character.
A hint of smoke plays about the nose; likewise, the palate is restrained. This tight, closed wine requires time to let ripe and concentrated pear fruit and lime appear. This long zesty grapefruit finish promises future pleasure. Drink as of 2016.
Whiffs of lemon and lime zest lend verve to waxy white-floral notes on this honey-touched Riesling sparkling. Juicy and a touch sweet with ripe stone-fruit flavors, it's elegantly balanced with a streak of high-pitched acid and soft, delicate bubbles.
If you don't mind some heavy barrel char, then you'll probably like this rough rider. It has espresso and asphalt on the nose, and then you get leathery plum and berry fruit on the palate. A good wine, with a long finish, lots of oak and overall balance. In a nutshell, there's plenty going on.
With layers of nutty, toasty oak flavors lingering in the background, this is a Sauvignon Blanc with lushness to its core of melon, guava and grass notes.
A fresh, fruity and sophisticated wine, this offers acidity balanced by dry tannins. It has juicy black currant fruits, hints of mint and a bright, smoky feel. The wine will obviously age, so drink from 2016.
This is a wine that wants a little time in the cellar. It has very rich, ripe, concentrated blackberry and cherry flavors, accented with bacon, smoky oak and black pepper. But it's tannic and the fruit is jammy. The parts simply haven't knit together. Give it 2–3 years.
A bright nose with green apple and citric aromas comes with mild oak. This is acidic and racy in composition, with roundness along the edges of the palate. Apple and nectarine flavors are lightly oaked and salty, while this holds form on a high-acid finish.
With plenty of new wood, the wine has a velvet character, smooth and round. Only gradually does a plum skin, bitter chocolate element come in, giving structure and weight. This is a wine that should age well.
This Douro red speaks clearly of its origins, blending anise and mineral notes with ripe fruit. Resin and spice notes add interest to the black cherry flavors, backed by just a hint of toasty oak. Structured and firm, this wine could use a bit more lushness and flesh, but nicely conveys its sense of place. Imported by Supreme Wines & Spirits.

Slight smoke and dark plum, a hint of polished mahogany and the merest touch of leather suggest restrained elegance and complexity. The palate is just medium-bodied but of such subtle balance that the entire wine becomes utterly seductive even though heat is palpable. There are dark, brooding elements of fruit that play above the taut, grippy but fine structure. What a distinguished, beautiful rendition of Merlot.
This opens with aromas of blue flowers, ripe blackberry, aromatic herb and an earthy note of tilled soil. The palate offers dried black fruit, toast, vanilla and coffee alongside smooth but rather fleeting tannins.
This soft, balanced selection has warm, ripe red fruits that are laced with acidity. With its spicy edge and open texture, this is ready to drink now.
Deep color, vivid oak, smoky aromas, and rich clove and blackberry flavors. It's full bodied, smoothly tannic in texture and has a lingering finish.
Loosen's 2009 spätlese from the Wehlener Sonnenuhr is a lush, medium-bodied wine loaded with honey and peaches. It's superripe and succulent, with a long, fruity finish. Try it with Szechuan dishes, which will buffer the sweetness of the wine while the wine tames some of the heat.
Marked by ripe blackberry and cherry pie flavors, this offers plenty of pleasure. It's clean, robust and tannic, and finishes with an array of spices. This should appeal to those who like Zinfandel on the soft, sweet side.
There's an almond nut, herbal quality to this Prosecco Brut that gives it a broader, dusty quality. The wine is simple and light with a clear, watery feel and some peachy sweetness on the close. Fruit is sourced from the Friuli region in northeastern Italy.
Bright and fresh with buoyant aromas of plum, blackberry and mature cherry, Fossacolle's 2005 Brunello (by vintner Sergio Marchetti) is a dark and concentrated wine with impressive aromatic depth. The mouthfeel is lean and compact with firm, polished tannins.
An unusual Zinfandel, with 10% Cabernet Franc mixed in, American Legend is from Frank Gunther's Vineyard in California's Shenandoah Valley (the Zin is anyway; the Cab Franc is estate). Smooth with a background of smoky berry flavor, it suggests sweet tarts mid-palate, and a taste of chocolatey vanilla on the finish.
Raisiny, with aromas of stewed fruit and sweet almond candy. Basic but blunted on the palate, with a dull feel and nonexistent tannins. Adequate on a good day; a bit weedy. Imported by Joseph Victori Wines.
The wine opens with funky, charred campfire aromas that blow off quickly enough to reveal black cherry and dried currants. The mouthfeel is light and lean with a compact, quick close.
This oak-influenced Barbera manages to nicely integrate the tartness of fresh fruit with the vanilla and spices imparted by oak aging. Cherries mingle with cinnamon, clove and vanilla, with a proper amount of acidity on the finish. Decent value, too.
A simple, direct red blend based on Cabernet Sauvignon, soft and sweet in fruit. It shows candied flavors of blackberries and cherries.
Made in a round, soft style, this is an atypically mouthfilling Sauvignon filled with notes of nectarines, honey and ripe citrus. It's a summer crowd-pleaser for the beach crowd.
The herbal Boulder Bluff bottling remains rather stubbornly closed, even after being open for several hours. It's tart with fruit flavors of cranberry and green apple.
This tastes tight, tannic and acidic, lacking richness despite its core of black cherry fruit. It is a letdown after the winery's wonderful 2007 bottling. It's made using grapes sourced from older vines way up on Howell Mountain, so there's always the chance it will improve with age.
A moderately intense Prosecco that wins points for its elegance and refined floral tones. Flavors are of lemon-lime crispness with dried sage and pink grapefruit. On the sweet side, but refreshing nonetheless. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.
From elegant white producer Paul Cluver, this wine starts with a beautiful nose of fragrant peach, honey and apricot, then unfolds into an enticing balance of lush peach, pineapple and apricot flavors. Elegant but fresh, the complex flavors mingle perfectly with a bright, zinging acidity. The lingering finish offers a touch of orange peel and dried apricot. Delicate but full of character.
A strong effort from Jean-Luc and his team, the 2014 Les Forots is a nearly 50-50 blend of Grenache and Syrah. It offers layers of ripe fruit, ample weight and a supple mouthfeel, with just hints of garrigue for complexity and interest. Drink now–2022.
This Syrah shows the dramatic richness of almost any Stagecoach red. Midnight black in color, it's enormously extracted in blackberry jam fruit, with complex notes of grilled meat, black pepper, licorice, violets and subtle minerals. The tannins are huge, but furry and pliable. If you have to drink it now, give it a few hours in the decanter. But it should benefit by reposing until 2017 in the cellar.
Using grapes sourced from the excellent Stillwater Creek Vineyard, this is a ripe—to the point of being pruny—yet acidic red wine. The unsettled mix of raisiny fruit and chalky acids may or may not shake out with further bottle age.
Bold and ripe in taste, this full-bodied wine packs in plump blackberry and boysenberry flavors, a rich texture from firm tannins and lip-smacking acidity that keeps it lively. Slow-cooked ribs, anyone?
This is 100% Cabernet Sauvignon from the Wallula vineyard, made by Gilles Nicault of Long Shadows. A tight, focused, pure, firm, classic Cabernet Sauvignon, it offers bucket loads of sweet cassis and cherry fruit, sculpted with crisp acids and polished tannins. A big, supple bottle that gracefully unwraps itself to show streaks of graphite, licorice, smoke and coffee; it could pass for a cult Cab from one of Napa's great boutiques.
A blend of batches made in neutral oak and stainless steel, there's no obvious toast or vanilla to this fruit-driven Chardonnay. Apple, pear and citrus notes lead the way, showing decent weight on the palate before ending slightly short.
While this Chardonnay is packed with ripe pineapple, pear and tropical fruit and has decent acidity, it's awkwardly sugary and raw. Tastes like Chinese sweet and sour sauce. The fruit is good, but the wine needs to be drier.
This is a Merlot-dominant blend, with Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Malbec and Petit Verdot in supporting roles. The voluptuous nose introduces a riot of blue and purple fruit flavors—a comingling of berries and plums. Streaks of fresh herb, mocha and cacao enter gracefully, leading onto the rich, deep and lusciously long finish.
Made entirely with Sangiovese, and fermented and aged in amphora, this racy wine has aromas of wild berry, moist soil, blue flower and clove. The vibrant palate delivers black cherry, raspberry, white pepper, anise and mineral alongside a backbone of firm acidity.
A restrained version of Tempranillo, it's somewhat lacking in fruit. The wine veers more into the roasted coffee range of things, a deep, heavy roast that some may find astringent without the buoyancy of black fruit.
Coming from a San Benito County appellation created in 2008, this wine shows dried blueberry, blackberry, leather and earthy black loam on the nose. Blueberry comes through on the palate, boosted by pepper, tobacco and a bit of espresso.
Crisp and tart in lemon peel and grapefruit, the loveliest aspect of this lightly ripe wine is its sublime texture, an earthy velvety expression of fineness and elegance that persists in its delicacy.
Creamy berry and cherry aromas with glove-leather accents open into a tart cherry palate. Strikes a lean profile, with cedar and leather notes and even tannins on the dry finish. Best cellared a year or two; if it evolves well, it may merit a higher score.
Offered exclusively to mailing list customers, this 93-case wine is intensely built and loaded with dark, smoky, charred scents and flavors. Dense and compact, it seems built much like a Cabernet—on a base of sharp acids and dry tannins. Currently the layers that are so compact it's difficult to dissect them. Coffee liqueur, baking chocolate, smoke and even a whiff of eucalyptus are all in the mix.
Full-bodied, broad and a bit oily in texture, this concentrated old-vine Marsanne seems a bit evolved, with open aromas of honeyed fruit and truffle backed by citrusy fruit and a hint of anise. Long and intense on the finish. Drink now.
Tastes hot and peppery, in part because of high alcohol. But it's super fruity, dry and tannic, the kind of Zin that's just begging for a barbecued slab of steak or chicken, liberally slathered with sauce.
Light and textured, it's packed with lime and lemon flavors with a hint of sage. As dry as a bone, it's very much for food and is ready to drink.
Not a bad wine at all. Has cherry-berry fruit, with gritty, sweet tannins. Totally dry.
Terrific, from its nearly indefinable aromas akin to Cloud Ear fungus to its intensely sweet yet racy palate. Dried apricot, peach and pineapple flavors give it substance without excessive weight, finishing long and intense. Drink now–2030.
Mazzei, the family behind Fonterutoli in Chianti, is the maker of this 100% Sangiovese, which offers a strong, piercing nose of earth, leather, red fruit and oak. If given time in the glass, the muscular palate loosens its stern grip, unveiling a nice underlay of plum, berries and oak. Far better than pedestrian, this is a sturdy, well-made Tuscan red.
This is a crisp, aromatic Syrah, with notes of earth, iodine, anise, pepper, clove and cassis threaded throughout. The balance of all the elements, including acid and tannin, is spot on, and the length through the finish suggests it can age for five or six more years.
Rusty and mature in color, with saucy aromas of tomato, baked plum, herbs and wild brush, this straggling Garnacha-Carignan blend from an excellent year feels full, energetic and loaded to the brim. Flavors of herbal plum, mocha, chocolate and mixed spices finish healthy. Overall, this is showing very well after 15 years. Drink through 2024.
A firm, dense wine, it currently shows plenty of dry tannins along with potentially ripe fruits. Already showing balance, it is developing into a complex, rich wine that will be full of black fruits and smoother tannins. Drink from 2017.
Big and concentrated, this wine's spice and dark fruit flavors are sustained by solid tannins and acids. It has a rich texture that's laced with acidity, so give this concentrated wine another 4–5 years.
Klipsun Vineyard provides all of the Cabernet for this wine, with a splash of Petit Verdot (6%) coming from Olsen. Aromas of sweet herb, spice, wet copper penny and cherry lead to a full-bodied palate that shows a fine sense of balance. This vineyard's often substantial tannins are well tamed.
Unconvincing aromas are hard to describe. This Malbec sparkler is coarse and foamy on the palate, with burnt peppery slightly bitter flavors of orange and grapefruit.
Sound and full on the nose, this features plum and berry aromas. This is a full-bodied, round Malbec that's neither overextracted nor excessively heavy. The flavors of baked berry, chocolate and herb are nice, as is the spicy finish of mint and tobacco.
This luminous blend of Insolia and Viognier offers a very pretty and feminine juxtaposition of fragrant floral aromas (from the Viognier) against tones of citrus, peach and kiwi from the Insolia. There's a touch of sweetness on the close.
Opening aromas of cherry, leather, oak and tobacco continue to the palate, which also carries a note of espresso. The wine shows the heat of the vintage with a warm midpalate and a general lack of freshness. Drink soon.
Bursting ripe fruit aromas of cherry, black currant, cassis, plum and prunes are backed by fine mineral tones of slate, granite and loads of exotic spice. You'll taste chocolate, cinnamon, sweet fruit and crushed clove: The wine's extra long finish is powered by smooth, silky tannins.
Awesomely rich and ripe in Meyer lemon tart, orange zest and golden mango flavors, with oak and lees nuances that make it complex and interesting. The wine did not undergo malolactic fermentation, which gives the acidity the bite of a fresh green apple.
One of a series of limited releases of older vintages of Dom Pérignon, this wine is showing the mature richness of the vintage and of the Dom Pérignon style. It has toast, yeast, roasted almonds, a powerhouse of ripe fruits and a smooth, creamy aftertaste. Let this wine breathe before drinking, it will be worth it.
A wine that starts almost too soft, the structure only slowly coming through. The fruit is pleasant, wood and bitter chocolate, tobacco and spice, but the wine lacks definition.
The nose on this brut is a touch grassy, with apple aromas. On first take, it feels foamy, but with time it settles down. Flavors of sulfur, apple and saline finish with pithy citrus notes and flavors of spiced apple, rhubarb and mild bitterness.
This high-toned wine's sharp, gin botanical-like aromas carry over into its flavors. Lime and other citrus notes are accented with a touch of talcum powder and some residual sweetness. Though a bit unusual, it's certainly flavorful.
Lucien Lardy takes the risk of not using sulfur during fermentation, giving a wine that retains its great fruitiness. It's bright, full of red cherry fruits and lively acidity. Tannins are a hint in the background, enough to give structure but not to suggest long aging. Drink until 2018.
A blend of 51% Cabernet Sauvignon, 26% Merlot, 14% Malbec and 9% Cabernet Franc, this opens with rich, decadent scents of brandied cherries, blackberries, plum and crème de cassis, all married to assertive notes of black pepper, licorice and tree bark. Structured yet fine-grain tannins result in an approachable palate and a texture like crushed satin, while the finish offers accents of cigar box and roasted cocoa nib. Drinkable now, but will hold well through 2020.
A ripe, rich wine that would be perfect for some grilled game or barbecue fare. Aromas of coffee, cocoa, and kirsch lead in to flavors of raspberry preserves and subtle sous bois. With dusty tannins and moderate weight, this is a solid choice for any Pinot fan.
Despite the age, the color of this wine is still impressively vibrant and the ripe fruit and dense structure both speak of a wine that is still developing even nine years later. Such is longevity of a great Malbec. Blackberry fruit flavors charge through this wine that's reached the point of balance with the tannins. Drink now, although the wine will still be developing in 2018.
With a very slight spritz, this offers lots of zesty flavors that create a savory midpalate amid white pepper and yeast. Riper hints of green and yellow pear await in the background. There is immense concentration on the palate, which finishes almost with a kind of saltiness.
An interesting wine—one that combines a certain sour, resinous quality with hints of sur-maturité. Add leather, clove and cinnamon and the result is a reasonably complex wine for a reasonable price. Imported by Pasternak Wine Imports.
Principally Cabernet Sauvignon, this blends in small amounts of Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec. Broad fruit flavors range from strawberry into red plum, with some stemmy earth leading into stiff tannins. The astringent, earthy character is well-managed and balanced against the pretty fruit.
This is a light, bright wine with flavors of green fruits and citrus. There is a hint of yeastiness. Overall, a cool feeling wine that is ready to drink. Screwcap.
Angular plum aromas are grapy and display a lavender note. This is fairly full in body, with a slight syrupy quality to the palate. Black-fruit flavors are powerful but finish with rough, bumpy tannins.
Medium bodied and silky in texture, this is an unusually graceful and elegant Châteauneuf-du-Pape. Baked cherries and raspberries on the nose give way to a mix of red and black fruits on the palate, then finish fine, dry and savory. Drink now–2021.
Made entirely from Sangiovese, this opens with delicate black-skinned fruit and baking spice aromas. The straightforward palate delivers black cherry jam, cooking spice and white pepper flavors, rounded with ripe tannins. Enjoy soon.

A country-style wine, sharp in the mouth, with herb, coffee and berry flavors that finish dry.
Le Quare is a unique ripasso with an excellent balance between mineral tones that recall pencil graphite or chalkboard, and floral tones of pressed violets and dried lavender. The wine has a deep, saturated disposition and thick flavors of red fruit and natural rubber.
Full, rich wine, with a concentrated structure to go with the pineapple and apple juice flavors. Still young, the wine should age for a year, to fill out the structure and give final richness.
Notes of apple, yellow peach and pear are savory in tone in this unoaked Chardonnay. Dry in style, it's delicately concentrated with soft tangerine acidity. The finish is brisk but clean.
Made entirely from Sangiovese, this opens with aromas of black plum, vanilla and toast. The concentrated palate doles out black cherry jam, cedar and tobacco alongside assertive tannins. Drink through 2019.
It tastes lush, slightly sweet and full-on fruity, but has a lavish oak overlay. The aromas are sweet cherries and maple syrup, the fruit flavors come out as just-crushed grapes and cherries sprinkled with the brown sugar of new oak. Not heavy in texture and not as full-bodied as the flavors would make you think.
A rich, robust blend of Aragonês and Alicante Bouschet, this wine offers red fruits, spice and vanilla from wood aging. It is certainly rich, but there is elegance here as well; the exuberant fruit is tempered by acidity and some intensely firm tannins. Age for 4–5 years.
Despite its beautiful, luminous appearance, the nose of this Prosecco Brut is accented by a slightly pungent tone of almond skin or peanut that almost completely blows away with time. It is a streamlined, compact sparkler with crisp lime on the close.
A tough, gritty little Pinot Noir, not quite ripe. It smells and tastes of green mint and peppercorns, alongside the cherries and cola, and is rugged in texture.
Nuhar is an innovative blend of Nero d'Avola (70%) and Pinot Nero that surpasses expectations and does justice to both grape varieties. The cherry and almond tones of the first grape are present, as are the delicate violet, raspberry and cassis aromas of the second. The finish shows bright menthol and spearmint overtones.
This pale-pink sparkler, with large, chunky bubbles, offers aromas of mature berry, violet and rose. It's an easy wine that should be a good apéritif.
Here's your basic thermonuclear Petite Sirah. It's huge, powerful, triumphant in its own varietal way. Has the soft lushness and immediate succulence of a modern cult Cabernet, with a vast array of chocolate, blackberry, blueberry and cherry pie filling flavors that are almost candied, but the finish is thoroughly dry. With its firm tannins, it should live for many years. If you're a “Pet” fan, this is the one to buy.
Kind of hot and jagged, with forward cherry and plum aromas softened by vanilla. Cherry and raspberry flavors are basic and racy, with some spice. Tight on the finish, with hard tannins. Imported by Winebow.

All varietal, this wine leads with an unusual assortment of aromas that include anise, smoke, cigar box, vanilla and ripe blackberry. The flavors are tart and compact with a grainy feel. It provides intrigue but the variety seems to get lost.

Serious and concentrated, this is a big and bold wine packed with ripe fruit flavors and firm tannins. It smells oaky and smoky, tastes rich with blackberry and dark chocolate and feels appropriately astringent, dry and full-bodied. Drinkable now, it will be best after 2017.
Dry Creek Valley has a natural affinity for Marsanne, and particularly in this balanced vintage. The grapes got ripe in lemon chiffon, peach and honeysuckle flavors, while a clean crispness and minerality add length and palate interest. Sur lies aging in the barrel brings even richer notes of cream and smoky vanilla. This Marsanne explores the outer reaches of the variety's possibilities in California.
This BSH is 77% Cabernet Sauvignon, 8% Merlot, and includes 15% Cabernet Franc. It's among the best of the recent releases from O•S, with the two Cabs dominating with berry and cassis, earth and cacao. The tannins are lightly grainy and well-balanced.

Soft and creamy, this has good intensity of flavor. Ripe pear and red apple flavors introduce a soft, rounded texture and a rich, ripe finish. Screwcap.
This is like a junior vintage. Because Niepoort bottles its LBVs unfiltered, they have ripeness and balance, while the fruit has great concentration of flavor. This is very rich with many black fruit and dark plum flavors, but at the same time it has a core of structure and tannin, which suggests that it could age. Bottled in 2006.
Fans of this variety will find something really interesting here. While the wine has the bigtime wild berry, chocolate, leather and spice flavors that Petite Sirah so dependably produces, it also boasts alcohol below 14%, giving it welcome balance. With thick, furry tannins, it's a guaranteed ager, if you like your Pets old.
This starts off sweet and unctuous, with scents of superripe nectarine and apricot that flood the bouquet, followed by hints of baking spice, lightly toasted nuts and honey. The full, round texture is balanced by refreshing acidity that carries through to the long, bright finish. Drink now–2016.

Aged 15 years in oak, Donnafranca Marsala is a new product from these historic cellars with notes of resin, maple syrup and honey roasted almonds. At 19% alcohol it's intense and powerful without the burn; it ends on a long note of toasted almond.
Cottonwood Canyon specializes in Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, but they also have three acres of Syrah in their Santa Maria vineyard. The result in this bottling offers aromas blending red fruit with minty herbs, like a cherry cough drop. The wine is fairly lean on the mouth, representative of a cooler-climate expression of the grape, with oregano, sour cherry, cranberry and chalky minerality. The finish is reminiscent of crème brûlée.
Wiry cherry aromas are a touch cheesy and also medicinal. This is pinched and astringent, with a choppy mix of buttery red-berry flavors and vanilla. Like most 2008s, this finishes hard and abrupt, with staunch tannins.
Break out the prosciutto-wrapped figs and stuffed mushroom appetizers for this light, silky rosé. It's crisp in acidity and delicate in the mouth, with assertive raspberry, orange tea and honey flavors. This is one of the more successful Pinot Noir rosés out there.
A pulsing core of dried plum and black-cherry flavors marks this buxom Petit Verdot. While bold and brawny, a balsamic edge and fine tannins lend subtlety. Its rich, mouth-filling silkiness clings pleasantly on the finish.
Peach, melon and vanilla cookie aromas are mild, simple and a touch mealy. The mouthfeel on this basic Albariño is fleshy and plump, with adequate acidity. Sweet apple and tropical fruit flavors are lasting and stay the course.

This is soft and jammy, with raspberry, cherry and oak flavors. A pretty wine, with a good tannin-acid balance, for drinking now.
Impressive, but so young, this is a Pinot Noir-dominated vintage, the richness as yet a mere hint in the welter of acidity and fruit. Already, though, this is   shaping up to be a structured, tight wine, with great final balance.
Quite basic and innocuous. The nose offers simple berry and plum, but nothing exciting. The palate is earthy, fruity and solid; but again, nothing out of the ordinary. And it's short on the finish. Good but leaves you wanting more.
Rivus is a clean expression of Sangiovese (with a small component of Canaiolo) that is aged only in stainless steel in order to preserve the freshness of its aromas and its easy berry flavors.
With a core fashioned from older clonal material, this wine doesn't have quite the same vibrancy and fruit of some flashier counterparts. What it does have is some wonderful underbrushy complexity: earth, mushrooms, bracken and spice, balanced by just enough cola and cherry fruit. Finishes wiry and a bit herbal.
Ripe, rubbery berry aromas become like chocolate-covered cherry with time. The palate is full and a bit syrupy, while the palate is creamy and sweet, with baked blackberry and peppery flavors. Sweet and soft on the finish, with herbs and a touch of coffee-like bitterness.
The wine is crisp and mineral. It has zesty lemon as well as a tight texture and layers of acidity. It is ready to drink although another few months aging will make it even better when its softens out. So drink from late 2017.
Emerging winemaker Spencer Daley makes a very light expression in this bottling from Curtis Vineyard. Delicate lime-peel aromas show on the nose. Flavors of yellow apple, grapefruit pith and concrete arise on the sip, making for easy drinking though nothing too complex.
Beautiful aromas in this wine, with its perfume of wild forest blueberries, smoke, earth and just a hint of raisins. Would be better if it weren't so soft, to the point of collapse.
Earthy, smoky berry and cherry aromas are distinctly leathery and lightly herbal. This feels tight and bold, with cutting acidity. Flavors of toasty oak, herbal plum and black peppercorn finish long, due to blazing residual acidity. In fact, this is a sharp rendition of Erasmo that's not likely to get any more friendly than it currently is. Drink through 2025.
Wood-fermented wine, giving a ripe and honeyed character over toast, pear juice and golden apple flavors. The final tastes is deliciously citrus, with a light mineral edge.
There's a very cooked quality to this bottling, with aromas of kirsch, stewed cherry, grape juice, coffee and strong violets. Somewhat sweeter flavors of strawberry, plum and cocoa dust show on the sip, held up by decent acidity.
This is Pet in all its full-bodied glory. It's a dark, rich wine, stuffed with enormous plum, black currant, coffee and bitter chocolate flavors that finish absolutely dry. Despite the size, it achieves balance and harmony. This is one of the best Petite Sirahs I've had this year. Good now, and should hold for at least a decade.
Fresh raspberry and plum aromas are minty but get the job done. This feels raw but not scouring, with prodding acidity and herbal berry, vanilla and paste flavors. Minty, herbal finishing notes touch up against herbaceous.

Dense, rich and ripe, this has some tannic structure, but it's less salient compared to the ripe fruit, soft texture and juicy acidity. This wine can age, although it is already showing fruitiness.

Made with Nero di Troia grapes, this has aromas of wild rose, citrus peel and a whiff of Mediterranean brush. The bright informal palate offers sour cherry and strawberry accompanied by zesty acidity.

A very elegant and refined Evenstad Reserve, with grace notes of sandalwood and a lovely cherry core. The fruit is immaculate, the concentration focused and lengthy, and the flavors are so artfully blended that the wine is seamless and perfectly balanced.

Jammy raisiny berry aromas are soft and a bit flabby. In the mouth, this is dense, jammy and fleshy. Roasted plum and berry flavors carry a salted note, while this holds steady on the finish.
Old wines are not easy to appreciate, so we'd almost rather have you judge this wine. In our opinion, it's way too sour and lacking in fruit to justify rave reviews. Thirty years of age doesn't seem to have helped it, and what's left is sherried and pruny, yet with sharp acidity.
Contains 67% To Kalon Vineyard fruit. Still a baby. Closed, brooding, very deep, very dry. Fabulous cassis fruit, a huge wine. Lots of delicious, sweet new oak. Superbly balanced, impressive. Drinkable now, but best 2010–2020.
Ultraripe black currant, chocolate, date and oak flavors mark this Cabernet. It's as rich as Raymond's other District Collection Cabs, yet somehow has greater vitality and energy. Drink now, after decanting, and through 2022.

Dull and medicinal, with LifeSaver candy cherry and raspberry flavors.

As often with wines that have some Baga in the blend, rusticity fights with elegance. In this case, elegance is winning as the wine ages. The herbal element is important as is the sweet jelly fruit.

This Chianti sees six months of wood aging to render distinct oak-related aromas that come on the heels of, and almost overwhelm, the red fruit and cherry. The tannins are hard, just shy of astringent.
Bright and fragrant, this offers scents of acacia, herbs and stone fruit accented by a hint of nuts. The bright palate offers white peach, green apple and citrus framed in vibrant acidity together with a frothy mousse.
One of the producer's longest-standing vineyard sources, this Hyde is gorgeously savory and lightly textured, while offering plenty of depth and complexity on the palate.

Fresh and fruity, this wine also provides smooth, yet sizable tannins.
Gérard Charvet took over Rosiers from his father in 1983 and remains focused on the art of vinification. A percentage (30%) of wood aging has give this ripe wine its dense texture. That contrasts with the generous black fruits that are still developing. This is a serious, dense wine that will age. Drink from 2018.
Try this as an interesting alternative to Chardonnay to pair with grilled salmon or chicken. It's rich and creamy, with ripe orange, apricot, mango and honey flavors, but balanced with crisp acidity. The blend consists of Roussanne, Viognier, Picpoul Blanc and Marsanne.
This Rioja rose displays a full bouquet of rose petal, spice and the slightly meaty element that Tempranillo so often shows. No White Zinfandel, this is a fairly lean and dry wine with spicy notes, a decent match for hors d'oeuvres or light meals.
92-94. Barrel sample. A smooth, mellifluous wine, with its intensity masked by tight acidity. It shows the weight of the vintage, and the power of the botrytis that's interspersed with flavors of orange zest and lime. It should age magnificently.
Hogue also makes a Cabernet-Merlot, but this wine includes both those grapes, 20% Syrah, and a pinch of Malbec. It's firm, tart and supple, with iron filings and black olive, black cherry and moist earth. You don't often find this much muscle and grip in a $10 wine.
With lots of sweet oak, this is a simple Chardonnay. It's marked by buttered toast, caramel, vanilla and pineapple jam flavors that will appeal to fans of this ripe California style.
Ripe, jammy fruit marks this polished young Cabernet. It's rich in cherries and red licorice, with a sweet liqueur potency and an umami intensity suggesting salty smoked meats. The tannins are considerable in this muscular wine, which suggests aging for five or six years.
Rough, round and ravishing, this is a rock ‘n' roll red that takes no prisoners. The Klipsun/Red Mountain tannins and power are there in abundance, but the edges have been smoothed, the balance is perfect, and the fruit is pure and expressive. This wine resonates out from a core of pure cherry/berry; it lingers and expands into a lush rainbow of strawberry and earth.
Coparossa Barbaresco is set apart by an additional note of oak spice that, with time, will certainly evolve into shades of clove, oak, hazelnut and chocolate.

Fresh, floral and not overbearing on the nose, this has red berry and cassis aromas, with no interference from oak or too much extraction. It feels pure and elegant, with wild berry and cherry flavors that end on a ripe, slightly sweet-tasting finish. Good for near-term drinking.
A top blend, Penley's 2004 Chertsey combines 60% Cab Sauvignon, 28% Merlot and 12% Cab Franc to make a wine that's Bordeaux in conception but strongly Australian in actuality. The Merlot adds a rich mocha component, while the predominant notes are of cassis, mint and chocolate, framed by plenty of French oak. It's a bit warm on the finish, but balanced by crisp acidity—a satisfying steakhouse red to drink now–2015.

The palate is alive but still quite dark, with huge black plum and blackberry flavors. Super long on the finish, with a subtle streak of vanilla and coconut. Delicious but also deft. 450 cases produced.
The aroma suggests a ton of oak, and that impression carries over to the flavors. Butterscotch, buttered toast, caramel, crème brûlée, they're all tasty, but you don't want them to dominate, and here, they do. The underlying flavors of pineapples are swamped.
Here's a dark and well concentrated Brunello with aromas that recall wild berries and appleskin. The fresh intensity of those aromas suggest slight volatility, but this doesn't seem to distract too much from the overall picture. In the mouth, the wine is very polished and squeaky clean.
This wine is concentrated, with fruit that seems too ripe. Jammy berry flavors are mixed in with dry tannins and a firm backdrop. It's solid, although not quite balanced. The estate was founded in 1967 by Philippe Raguenot; daughters Emmanuelle and Marie-Pierre took over in 1997.
Grapy and lusty, this is a barbecue-style wine for easy drinking. It floods the mouth with freshly crushed berries, plums and milk chocolate. Good value for an everyday, big red wine.

Tightly herbaceous, this is also a friendly, fruity wine. With bright acidity, crisp lemon and grapefruit flavors, it's cool and bright. Drink now.
Santa Rita's SB always exhibits the peppery, green side of the variety. And as in the past, this vintage veers perilously close to being vegetal. But amid the cucumber, bell pepper and asparagus notes there's gooseberry and passion fruit. A zesty, green wine to be sure.
Given time to ferment and age in a majority of neutral oak, this wine still offers thickness and viscosity. It's rich and lush in tropical pineapple, mango and sliced peach, buoyed by acidity and a focused approach.
A big, tough, young wine that's a little rustic now, but could develop soft, mellow complexities in the bottle. The acids and tannins now gang up on the berry and currant flavors, dominating them. Give it until after 2009.
A bit edgy in tannins and with some green flavors, but not a bad Cabernet for the price. Dry and robust, it shows blackberry and currant flavors, with a touch of smoky oak.

There's also something wonderfully earthy, like roasted mushrooms splashed with balsamic and tamari sauce. The cool 2010 vintage was kind to Bacigalupi Vineyard, which can produce overripe wines in hot years.
Color doesn't always mean a lot, but in this case a burnished gold-meets-tan color indicates that this is tired and fading. Aromas of commercial apple juice are sweet but bland. This feels a bit citric but without bounce. The mix of spent lees and cidery flavors finish bready.
A good grip of acidity and tannins shape the fruity, earthy aromas and crisp raspberry and cranberry flavors. It's a very lively, refreshing style that is not overripe, and will be great with all kinds of food.

Crisp and textured, this offers plenty of fresh apple and red fruit flavors. It's a light, bright wine that's poised and stylish, in a fine apéritif style.
Made in a lighter style, but with Zin's distinctive wild berry, coffee and peppery spice flavors. The finish flirts with residual sweetness, then pulls back to finish dry and tannic.
Gigantic is just one word to characterize this Zinfandel. For starters, it's enormously high in alcohol—at 16% by volume, it's almost Port-like. Yet it's dry and smooth in tannins, and the heat gives a heady boost to the black currant, black pepper and sweet oak flavors. Not for everyone, but it defines this powerful Dry Creek style of Zin.
92-94 Packed with tannins, new wood and a dense character, this is going to be a wine for the long-term. It has all the power, although with a softer side in the final fruitiness.
This Fiddletown Zin has a sweet graham cracker and marshmallow quality about it, soft and round in the middle, and a finish that's long and a touch green.

Opens in hard fashion, with horseradish and additional bitter aromas eventually yielding to boysenberry and blackberry. The palate is chewy and comes with firm tannins, and the flavors are a standard but nice mix of black fruits and mocha. Short and sturdy on the finish.
Co-fermented with 5% Viognier, this wine's appealing fresh flower, orange peel, ham hock and black olive tapenade aromas jump out of the glass. The palate is light, tart and sleek, not delivering on all that the aromas suggest but still providing plenty of intrigue.
Earthquake wines often hit you quite deliberately over the head with oak and tannin, but this is nicely done. It's big and very fruity, with cranberry and cassis notes intermingled with a blackberry flavor. Smooth throughout, the wine finishes with a delicious hit of toffee and vanilla.

Tight but juicy blueberry and elderberry fruit show on the palate, bound together by upright tannins and lifted with asphalt, black peppercorns and potpourri spice.
Star winemaker Ernie Loosen is now consulting for Graff, and the wines have taken a step up in quality.

The winery has hardly changed its winemaking formula over the decades. Gravelly Meadow remains toughly closed, dry and tannic in youth, despite its core of blackberry and cherry fruit.

With its compact nose of blackberry and cassis aromas, this wine comes across as ripe and modern. In the mouth, it's round, bouncy, tannic and exuberant, but not overdone. Flavors of blackberry and fig are smooth, while the finish is rich and ready. Drink through 2017.
Here's a big, dark, ripe and oaky Pinot Noir, brimming with cherry pie, raspberry Newton, oatmeal cookie and Asian spice flavors. It's a little soft in acids and tannic, but dry and silky. Try aging until at least 2011, and should develop additional bottle complexity through 2014.
A Sauternes-style white dessert blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon, and quite a good one. Shows sweet flavors of apricot jam, pineapples, vanilla crème brûlée and spices, with fine, crisp acidity for clean balance.
Brawny, toasty aromas prop up a sturdy oaky nose with a familiar dark-berry core. This Malbec is tightly wound, with wiry acidity. Flavors of blackberry, cassis, spiced plum, chocolate and cardamom finish earthy and mellow, with a lingering note of exotic spice. Drink through 2022.
Aromatically, this blend of Macabeo, Muscat and Chardonnay gets off to a decent start by showing honeysuckle, lemon verbena and minerality. But in the mouth it's sharp and narrow, with blazing acids that turn peach and nectarine flavors towards sour. Simply put, there's not enough body here for the wine to rate higher.
Tement's hallmark wine, a deeply herbaceous style, keeping freshness but also showing crisp, green character. There is a lovely citrus, green herb aftertaste. Glass stopper.
94–96. Barrel sample. This is a ripe, wonderful wine that's full of spice, pineapple and apricot with a green tang of herbaceous character. It's simply beautiful, with great style and a deceptively simple use of wood.
Contemporary Grenache Blanc expressions lean tight and bright, but this bottling takes an extremely tropical approach, showing honeydew, banana cream and bubblegum on the nose. It's restrained upon first sip before overpowering tropical waves take hold. A well-made wine, it will find fans who crave this flowery style.
A fresh, red, fruity wine, with flavors of herbs. The tannins are light, leaving an aftertaste of red berries and acidity. Easy and attractive.
This Merlot has not fully ripened, with aromas of bell pepper, green herbs and savory notes overriding any sense of variety. Flavors are faint and lighter in style, trailing on the finish.
A scent of fusel oil mixes into this lightly fruity wine, along with citrus rind and hints of almond.
A very fine, ageable Pinot that shows a feral, exotic quality that is rare, but always welcome. Grown on the true, cool coastal strip of the appellation, it's dry and crisp in citrusy acids, with intricate flavors of wild cherries, balsam, maple syrup, teriyaki-grilled beef, licorice, cola and Asian spices. Such is the tannic structure that it should evolve over the next 8–10 years.
This one smells like a French Prosecco, with effusive bubbles and a citrusy bouquet. Off-dry, with lots of orange flavors. It finishes with a lively, lengthy, orange-rind explosion. This is very well made, and invites a second or third glass. It rests gently on the palate, and lingers pleasantly.
Earthy and tight on the nose, with notes of wintergreen and fresh herbs. The palate is lean and drawing, while the flavors revolve around sweet berry fruit, earth and oak. Dry, peppery and a little bitter on the finish, but spicy and real. Nice and varietally correct for Argentinean Pinot.
A very good Merlot rich in baked plum and rhubarb with a back note of olive. Slightly spicy and medium-bodied, the finish offers smoke and spice.
A product of organic viticulture and American oak, the wine's scent and flavor are mainly blackberry with touches of chocolate, smoke and spice. The palate experience is good except for some unresolved coarse tannins. This is a solid Shiraz that needs just a little more time.
An oily and thick style of SB. It captures Leyda's coastal climate almost too much, resulting in green, lightly vegetal aromas and flavors. There's some pickle and bell pepper, and it seems underdeveloped throughout.
Light and fresh, this is elegant with green fruits, yellow peach, a mineral layer and citrus. A rambarde was a flat-bottomed boat which used to transport wine from the Loire to Paris.
This easygoing white starts with a fresh nose of grapefruit, fig and flowers and leads into zesty but complex flavors of tropical fruit and citrus. Approachable and balanced, the wine will pair well with seafood and chicken dishes.
A ripe, juicy charmer of a wine, aromatic and perfumed. Raspberry flavors, acidity and soft tannins come together and are underpinned by flavors of new wood and sweetness.
Fruity, spicy and just off-dry, with pleasant tropical fruit, wildflower, honey and ginger-cinnamon flavors. Nice low alcohol on this pretty wine.
Pretty lean and earthy, not showing much fruit beyond tobacco, applesauce and oak flavors. But it's clean and balanced.
Dusty in cocoa powder and leather, this is a dusty mountain of a Zin, from old Foothills vines. Soft and racy, enjoy with pizza or creamy lasagna.
Stunningly good for an entry-level Pinot Noir, this new Tavola gets the sort of care generally reserved for reserves. Native yeast fermentation and almost a year in 20% new French oak is where it starts; then a barrel selection is made and it's bottled unfined and unfiltered. Deep flavors emphasize black fruits, with a dash of pepper highlighting the finish.
All the juiciness of the St. Laurent is in this fruity wine: great red berries, the flesh of red plums, touches of blueberry tannins. This is all about vivid colors and flavors. A delicious summer wine.
Gorgeous and authentic, this full-flavored, Port-style wine renders deep, flavors of black cherry and cassis liqueur. Dark veins of chocolate syrup and coffee liqueur pump through the mix, making it smooth as butter. It's a wine that could age—but why wait?
One of the best wines to emerge from Lazio (the region of the Italian capital), this innovative blend of Syrah and Petit Verdot (15%) offers penetrating aromas of leather, espresso bean, dark chocolate and black cherry. It would pair with Rome's favorite pasta dishes including spaghetti carbonara.
Equal parts Merlot, Cab Sauvignon and Franc shape a beautifully opulent wine that is loaded with ripe fruit, smoke, polished black stone, smoke and chocolate. The wine is very influenced by 18 months of oak aging (it feels rich, supple and velvety) and will age 10 years or more.
Scents of wildflower and apple float out of the glass. The delicate aromas carry over to the light-bodied, linear palate, along with a hint of pear and a mineral accent. Vibrant acidity gives it a clean, fresh finish.
A wine that combines extreme fruitiness with more complex layers of wood, licorice, ripe spice, blackberries and a firm core of tannins.
Dry and mellow, this easy Merlot gets the job done. It has cherry and blackberry flavors that are a touch green and minty.
It's picked late, when the grapes are superripe, then winemaker Kip Bedell puts them in a freezer prior to crush to further concentrate the resulting must. The result is a thick, gooey, unctuous dessert wine with flavors of tangerines and honey. Yum.
This historic estate on the shores of Lake Garda is one of Amarone's biggest ambassadors when it comes to foreign markets. Good fruit sourcing has shaped a pretty 2003 vintage wine with a nice full nose and no sharp points. You'll encounter plum, black cherry, roasted nut, vanilla-coffee and exotic spice.
This is a very dry, elegant Pinot Noir that's sleeker and earthier than many other comparably priced Pinots out there. It has what you might call a Burgundian profile, with the cherry, raspberry, cola and spice fruit balanced by truffles, leather and a suggestion of dried pine needles.
This shows a bright yellow-gold color and light lemon and butter aromas. Pronounced butter, lemon and almond flavors almost overwhelm the lean texture. Tart in taste and light in texture, it refreshes the mouth.
This is an elegant, rich and round Volnay, with a red plum flavor and juicy acidity. With its fruitiness, this is already drinkable, although the tannic core does promise medium-term aging.
A study in dusty tannins and crisp, classic cassis and cranberry, this wine offers plenty of the beloved herbaceousness of old-school Cabernet, along with a soft-hearted structure and compelling notes of violet and soy. Medium-bodied, it's enjoyable now but has the legs to age through 2026.
Bone dry and crisp, this Sauvignon Blanc shows fresh, savory flavors of lemons, limes and grapefruits, with richer notes of pineapples, vanilla bean and honeysuckle. A firm minerality helps add structure and finesse. It's a great restaurant wine, especially at this price, but will be hard to find, with only 140 cases produced.
A clumsy wine. While there's some good blackberry fruit, the mouthfeel is sharp and edgy, suggesting green stems and pips resulting in hard tannins. Doesn't seem likely to age out.
Jané Ventura is known for its sparkling cavas, but this table wine from Xarello, Muscat and the obscure Subirat Parent grape is appealing because it doesn't bite off more than it can chew. There's no oak so what you get is lean, tranparent lemon and lime flavors and a ready mouthfeel. Interesting but not for everyone.
Previous vintages seemed a lot more ripe and forgiving than this one. The wine tastes very dry and sparse, struggling to suggest cherries or blackberries. Because of the thinness, the alcohol stands out.
A rich, complex Chardonnay with apple and peach notes and a strong mineral component. A scent of something like gunmetal or flint follows through in the flavors and helps give the wine a steely backbone. A distinctive wine; very dry and crisp.
Generally speaking we are big fans of Odfjell's wines, but not so much the Syrah. This vintage is a step up from the overdone, overoaked 2005. It has floral, high-toned berry and plum aromas and more than a kiss of vanillin and cream. The palate is tight, a bit lemony and woody, with forward flavors of red fruits, cola and mint. Not all that spicy, varietal or complex, but definitely a healthy, ripe wine.
This bistro-style red is dry and lusty in cherry, tobacco and spice flavors. The winery has not revealed what varieties are in it, but it tastes like a juicy, old-fashioned field blend, and will go well with a range of fare.
A smoky, intensely herbaceous wine, with flavors of grapefruit, gooseberries and touched with juicy white pears. Just to complete the medley, the aftertaste has some spice.
This blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and several other varieties defines the word rustic. It's soft in texture, and combines unripe vegetable and mushroom flavors with sugary sweet raspberry jam.
Deep and dense, this smells horsey and leathery, with aromas of earthy berries. The palate feels racy with acidity, and the flavors of berry, cassis, cola and vanilla lead to a sweet, jammy finish, with touches of vanilla and caramel.
There's meaty leather and sizable tannin in this mountain-grown Malbec, from an Atlas Peak vineyard sought after for many types of red grapes. Time in bottle has served it well, the bolder aspects and jammy blackberry and blueberry fruit softened by balanced acidity.
Oily aromas include sulfur and matchstick. The palate is full and bulky, what some might label cloying. The flavors are pure pineapple syrup, while the finish is very sweet. Teeters toward unctuous.
This rich and forward sparkling wine is fit for everyday drinking, with flavors of strawberry and raspberry parfait accompanied by a nice doughiness. It's pretty scoury, though, which gives it an abrasive mouthfeel.
This is built with red cherry fruit, tannins and a ripe feel. Chorey-lès-Beaune is a good source for fruity reds with just the right touch of structure.
Here's a fruit-forward Sauvignon with bold aromas of ripe cherry, blackberry and moderate spice. Pair this wine with oven-cooked pasta or pizza with broccoli and sausage.
This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Carmenère is the best wine from Santa Alicia I've come across. The nose is spicy, dry and delivers earthy cherry and plum aromas. It feels right and tastes of spicy raspberry and plum, with a fruity, complex finish. A good wine for food with nice acidity; drink now–2015.
Made from the classic Bordeaux varieties, this polished, supple wine is pretty tannic, but it's fine for drinking now. It shows a concentration of blackberry and black currant flavors, with a liqueur-sweet intensity that leads into a long finish.
This wine is fruity although it also has weight and a rich strand of spice and red plum-skin tannins. This 100% Gamay could age at least until early 2016, although one can just drink it now.
Flat and heavy, with pasty aromas. The palate deals bulky plum flavors, which are followed by black cherry and kirsch. Almost a red wine in its color and weight. Imported by The Marchetti Co.
The Shea is the most dense and concentrated wine among the 2004s. Jammed with blackberry, cherry, plum, licorice and earthy tannins. Great concentration and a smoky, black-tea finish. This is one to tuck away for a few years.
From a vineyard planted in 1924 in the northern reaches of the Napa Valley, Falleri is a tiny-production wine that's soft, supple and generously juicy and fruity. Boysenberry, blackberry and a trace of crisp red fruit combine around a core of earth, dotted by a floral bouquet. The finish is long and leathery.
This is a warm, honey- and apple-flavored wine. It's fresh and full in the mouth with tight mineral acidity. It could well age a year or two, but is ready to drink now.
The rich, spicy and savory nose evoke the food for which the country is known, and this wine would undoubtedly pair well with full-bodied, spiced meats and stews. Its full, spicy nose leads into dependable flavors of red berry, wooded spice and pepper, with a slightly bitter, smoked edge. Not a terribly complex wine, but solid and tasty nonetheless.
A big, woody, totally modern style of Syrah. There is a lot more coconut, mocha and big berry fruit than anything you might find from France. It's dark and layered on the palate, with coconut and resin supporting black fruit. Finishes smoky and oaky, but structured, tannic and serious enough to impress.
The aromas of pear and herb seem a bit overripe. The flavors are dry and seem a bit diluted.
Here's a structured white that boasts a classic varietal fragrance of cantaloup and tomato vine. The delicious palate delivers melon, pineapple and mineral flavors of great depth and impeccable balance. This will pair magically with asparagus recipes.
This reflects the Yarra region's Pinot Noir character well, combining earthy, cola- and beet-scented notes with well-ripened tannins and medium body. There's a fair bit of textural richness for such a modestly priced Pinot. Drink now.
One of the first wines to be released from the 2011 vintage, this Sauvignon Blanc shows how chilly the year was. It's barely ripe, showing dry, acidic citrus and mineral flavors, with a green, minty edge.
Lime leaf, white peach and mineral aromas rise up from the glass, with botrytis adding a grace note. The spritzy stone fruit flavors are off dry and show spot on balance.
Rubbery, leathery berry aromas are edged with woody accents. There's intensity and depth to the palate, which doles out rustic plum and berry flavors. A moderately powerful but ripe finish concludes this likable Mencía from a good year.
This blend of 66% Roussanne, 28% Grenache Blanc and 6% Viognier shows even more Roussanne character than the pioneering winery's single variety Roussanne. Honey, marcona almond, praline and lemon curd aromas lead to a grippy palate full of judiciously presented vanilla, marzipan, and mango flavors, with a beeswax note on the finish.
Tasted side-by-side with the winery's icon Viu 1, this is barely a step behind. The nose is baked, dark and slightly oaky, with vanilla, cream, blackberry and density. The palate is structured and solid, with black fruit, fine herb and dusty spice flavors. Finishes rich, with chocolate, fig and coffee flavors. Drink now through 2014.
This well-extracted and mature expression of Nebbiolo from the Antinori estate in Piedmont is a mature and fruit-driven expression of Barbaresco with dense concentration and a New World style. There's very good complexity here in the form of black licorice, chopped mint and rhubarb.
The Farina family was among the first to market this unique wine abroad. The Monte Fante cru smells like an opulent dessert: crème brûlée, brown sugar, sweet chocolate, toasted coconut, butterscotch, poached cherries and caramel candy.
Made from organically grown grapes, this bone-dry Champagne is steely with a tight mineral character. It offers intense acidity as well as ripe apples with a generous squeeze of lemon juice. It's fresh in the mouth and crisp at the end.
A pure, very clean and utterly delicious Cabernet that's perfect for drinking now. Shows real accomplishment in the ripeness of the blackberry, cherry, black currant and cocoa flavors, and in how well-balanced they are with tannins and oak. Just captivating, at a wonderful price.
Rustic and sweet, with a soft mouthfeel and candied cherry-berry flavors.
Soft and fruity, with raspberry, cherry, Dr. Pepper and oak flavors. It has the jammy, marmalade taste of freshly crushed berries, with citrusy acidity. The oak is front and center. Might develop with a few years in the bottle.
No oak on this charming wine, so what you get is pure lemon, peach and mango fruit flavor. It's definitely on the rich side, and could use greater acidity to balance out the sugary finish.
The partnership between vintner Bill Price and winemaker Gavin Chanin, Lutum continues to impress, aiming for elegance without giving up flavor or body. Tightly wound, a signature perhaps of the vintage, this wine is still subtle, suggesting rhubarb and cherry atop forest floor. Smooth, it hides elusive power on the significant finish.
This is a simply delicious and assertive wine that smells like roses and lemon zest, tastes like fresh apricots and biscotti and has a tangy, appetizing balance. It will be super as an apéritif for a summer time outdoor dinner.
Creamy vanilla, sweet caramel and candied berries add up to a wine designed for mass appeal and priced accordingly. It's smooth and goes down easy.
Dull and uninteresting, with some simple apricot flavors and unripe vegetal notes. Acceptable for its dryness and crispness, period.
A magical blend of 93% Cabernet Sauvignon, 5% Petit Verdot and 2% Cabernet Franc, this estate-crafted blend exudes elegance, etching out silos of herb, lavender, cedar and earth around savory-laced texture. A powerful concentration of dark chocolate appears on the lengthy finish, the wine sourced from dry-farmed, impeccably tended vines. Cellar through 2027.
This is one of the darker, more full-bodied rosés you'll ever have, but it's a pretty good one. It's likeable for its ultradryness, and the delicate flavors of rose petal, strawberry and thyme that lead to a complex finish.
Tastes immature now, with the toasty oak not yet integrated, and the tannins also stick out in all their sticky glory. The fruit is exceptionally ripe, suggesting grilled blackberries and black currants. The suggestion is ageability. Better sometime after mid-2010.
Sweet, delicious aromas of boysenberry and maple syrup, flavors like blackberry jam and a broad, generous texture turn this into a blockbuster wine. A touch of sweetness would make it great with something spicy and sweet like pork ribs.
Fresh, almost minerally berry aromas avoid any sense of weight, oak or heaviness. The blend of Garnacha, Carignan and Mourvèdre is uncommon in Chile, and it comes across with a sinewy, fresh mouthfeel and lightly herbal flavors of plum and cassis along with modest oak. Spice, tobacco, coffee and chocolate flavors carry the finish on this complex Maule Valley blend. Drink through 2020.
This bottling has been variable over the decades, but this 2010 shows fine form, a good sign coming on the heels of the excellent 2009. It's richly oaked and flashy in pineapple jam, buttered toast and creamy, yeasty flavors.
Ample toast, cinnamon and cedar gild this intensely ripe concentrated Cabernet Franc. It's a lusciously textured wine, full of fleshy blackberry and plum flavors. Velvety tannins, brisk red-currant acidity and meandering traces of smoked meat and game contribute finesse and depth. It's ready to drink now but should improve further through 2023.
This marks the debut of consulting winemaker Matthew Courtney's take on the estate site. It dazzles in complex notes of exotic Asian spice, lavender and crushed rock, while focused acidity provides a context of substance and depth.
From a site at 2,400 feet elevation, this wine's aroma suggests pencil lead, cedar, clove and mountain sage. With its juicy midpalate of black cherry and cassis, it unleashes firm, grippy tannins on its long finish, showing structure but also grace.
Much better than prior vintages, when it was known as Finca El Portillo. The nose is jammy and shows black fruit aromas, while the palate is complete and full but juicy, with plum and black cherry flavors. Pepper and toast flavors infiltrate the finish.
This is a sweet, rosé -colored sparkling wine (made from the Brachetto grape) with bright aromas of wild berry and peach. This particular wine also boasts soft foaming and a playful touch of ripe cherry on the close.
I Versi is a youthful blend of Nero d'Avola, Merlot and Syrah that offers plump aromas of ripe cherry and blackberry backed by soft tones of cinnamon and toasted almond. It's a perfect pairing to a heaping plate of spaghetti carbonara with crispy fried bacon.
Nice and silky in the mouth, with a rich overlay of toasty oak and savory spice, raspberry, cherry and strawberry flavors. Fine acidity adds clean brightness. A touch of underripeness detracts, so drink now.
Smells citrusy and oaky, with a distinct melon note. This is a simple, somewhat rough wine that expresses the most basic Chardonnay characteristics, but offers little beyond affordability.
Really easy to like now for its silky approachability, and for the way the flavors gather upfront and through the long, spicy finish. Polished and crisp, it has flavors of raspberries, cherries, tart cranberries and ripe pomegranates. The fruit is sourced from the cool, southern part of the Russian River Valley.
The earthy nose does no justice to the full, ripe fruit on the palate of this rounded, rich wine. There is some phenolic bitterness that is not unpleasant around the edges and a smidgeon of sweetness balanced by orange zest.
The Le Vigne cru from Luciano Sandrone delivers focused aromas of wild cherries, white almond, cola and light shadings of sweet spice. The texture is drying and firm and the wine excels in the mouth thanks to the tight and supple feel of its tannins. Pair this delicious wine with lamb, pork or beef.

Soft and tannic, with a sour candy-sweet taste, this Cab has flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants, anise and cedar. Drink now.

Stainless-steel fermented from 100-percent Lodi-grown Moscato Giallo grapes, Uvaggio's yearly dry Moscato is always a good value and great tasting. This one is layered with spice, but it's also very floral with a gentle imprint and a taste of ginger and lime.
Stalky, leathery aromas lack freshness and purity of fruit. This feels light to the point of dilute, while flavors of stalky raspberry finish salty and earthy, with a raw feel.
Best on the nose, which is floral as it mixes in big black fruit notes and coconut. The palate has a creamy, grabby feel and then confected flavors of carob, vanilla and baked berry. Finishes heavy and very sweet, i.e. syrupy.
Delicately scented, this opens with aromas of dried black cherry and toasted notes. On the concentrated palate, oak-driven spice takes center stage while mature dark-skinned fruit and dried prune provide the background. Pair it with Gorgonzola at the end of the meal.
Simple and semisweet, this PG has flavors of apple juice, ripe yellow apricots and sugar.
Hints of honey and caramel lend warmth to this ripe, unusually robust kabinett. Voluptuous body and haulting acidity augment its bold, expansive mouthfeel. A fringe of astringency lends some structure to the finish.

86–88. Barrel sample. Dark in style, this wine is marked by notes of licorice and coffee that lend bitterness, along with dense tannins. Very extracted.
A nice glass of Cab for $13. It's bone dry, with a scour of sandpapery tannins, and hints of cherries, blackberries, plums, cola and cedar. Shows real class for a statewide-appellated Cab at this price.
This wine really benefits from the delicious ripe fruit of the vintage. So broad, rich red-berry flavors give the wine a generous character with just the right amount of the balanced acidity. The wine is full, fruity and ready to drink.
With pineapple crème brûlée, Key lime pie and kiwi flavors that are accented with sweet, smoky oak, this Chardonnay offers an uptown sip compromised only by a certain herbaceousness. Drink now.
The wine is a typical, highly perfumed Sauvignon Gris. It has spicy lychee flavors and balanced acidity that produce a wine full of character and style. Poised and fruity, this delicious wine is ready to drink.
An austere Riesling in the traditional Australian style, the 2012 Isolation Ridge Riesling appears destined to have a long life. Penetrating lime aromas lead into a palate that's high strung and tight, but lined with mouthwatering fruit. An electric vibrancy of citrus and wet stones lingers on the finish. Drink now–2030.
Nice apple, vanilla and mineral on the nose, but flavorwise, the wine comes up reserved and simple. There's some citrus, pear and pineapple along with mineral and chalk, but it doesn't sing and it surely isn't intense. Lightweight; a nice quaff. Imported by Daniel Johnnes Wines.
This plump, medium-bodied Riesling is off-dry in style but avoids the one-dimensional fruitiness that sometimes plague the genre. Slate and brine notes mark the nose, balanced against peach, apple and citrus flavors.
Remember those vaguely anise-like white gumdrops? That describes the aromas and flavors found in the 2006 Les Sinards, albeit without the sugar. It's a medium- to full-bodied largely neutral white that should be consumed over the next year or two.
A ripe full-bodied wine that is a blend of Arinto and Fernão Pires. It misses out on the normal freshness of both grapes, giving instead rich yellow fruits and perfumed spice. There is some acidity, although not enough.
This is an interesting blend of Catarratto, Bianco Lucido and Grillo that appears very floral and perfumed on the nose: like a bouquet of white flowers. The wine is moderately crisp in the mouth and satisfied the palate.
The nose seems tight, almost reduced. In the mouth, plum and grapy fruit announce that this is pure Cabernet. It's dark and coffee-like on the finish. What the future holds for it is up for debate. Now it's sort of closed, yet still rather tasty.
A muskiness is present on the nose of this wine from Santa Barbara County's first commercial vineyard, along with fruitier aspects of strawberry-boysenberry tart. It's fruit-forward on the palate, yet cinnamon toast and cedar give it a more serious edge as well.
This 900-foot-high vineyard produces wines that are flinty, mineral and tight. With its textured character and zesty lemon notes, this wine is fresh yet still developing. Plenty of fruitiness will explode in the next few months. Drink after 2016.
Made to be opened now, this polished young Syrah is bright in blackberry, black currant, licorice and chocolate flavors, and is very dry. Oak provides a touch of smokiness. The tannins are all-important, providing a sturdy framework. Give it a few hours of decanting.
Here's a bright, ruby-colored Pinot Noir that opens with vibrant aromas of wild berry, raspberry and blue flower. There's a hint of white almond on the close and the wine end with fresh but simple fruit flavors.
An impressive, powerful pepper- and yellow fruit-flavored wine, which has been given a considerable depth of flavor by the wood fermentation and lees aging. The balance is great. It is a wine that shows class and aging potential.
Slightly sweet and confected with raspberry fruit roll-up and berry preserve aromas. A glimmer of crushed carnation flavors switch things up in the lightweight but round and soft mouth.
Here's a soft, gentle wine that's gooey-rich in cherry, cocoa-puff and ripe, sweet black raspberry flavors. Lightly oaked, it has a cleansing, espresso bitterness on the finish.
Stony lemon-lime aromas are low on fruit but clean and familiar. This is racy and fresh, with cutting acidity. Flavors of lime and passion fruit register as common, while the finish is zesty, with an emphasis on grapefruit.
This 16–acre estate is run biodynamically, producing intensely flavored, honeyed, ripe wines. This is succulent from ripe fruit, with the acidity bright and vivid, finishing with sweet pineapple and apricot flavors.
Tart red currant and bright acidity pull the wine into focus; the depth of Red Mountain terroir is just beginning to express itself, but the promise is there for a very special site with outstanding potential.
Benanti's Etna red opens with earthy tones of terracotta, dark chocolate, roasted espresso and crème de cassis. There's a gritty, thick feel to the tannins and the overall structure.
Marked by a lean minerality, this Chablis-style wine is not one of those fat, opulent Chards that dazzles with sheer richness. It's more subtle than that, and more acidic. Structure, in fact, is the name of the game here, with its lemon and lime flavors that barely break into green apples. Fine now, if not served too cold, and for the next 2–4 years. Beyond that, wines of this kind go quickly downhill.
This new-wood-dominated wine is ripe, but full of caramel and mint flavors. The fruit is more discreet, just hinting at blackberry richness. The potential to achieve balance in six months is all here.
From the Eichholz south-facing single vineyard, this is a wine that takes its minerality from limestone soil, which gives it concentration. White fruits are sprinkled with pepper and balanced with intense acidity. It is, of course, still young, needing 2–3 years. Screwcap. Imported by Michael Skurnik Wines.
This is a young but excellent gran reserva, so it's gritty-smelling in its youth, with aromas of blackberry and cassis. Racy acidity pushes the focus on the palate towards the upper tier, while flavors of lactic oak, lemon peel, tobacco and mocha share the stage with plum and berry fruit. Finishing flavors of vanilla and raw oak are supported by good acidity and just enough pulp. Drink through 2030.
Opere Riserva spends five years aging in the historic underground cellars of Villa Sandi in order to achieve its unique aromas of yellow rose, yeast, dried grass and honey. The wine boasts a bright, fresh finish with lingering floral flavors on the close.
The labels are hand-numbered; they are uniquely distinctive, with photos of ancient ruins that relate to historical events. This Merlot is sweet and pure and the oak shows through without obliterating the sweet fruit. It's a mélange of cherries, coffee and caramel; lush and round but spiced up and lifted with sweet acids. This exemplifies all that is delicious and profound about Washington Merlot.
This is a lean, fresh Riesling with white stone fruit at its core. Grass and mineral—even waxy—flavors freshen up the palate, and floral and saffron notes waft from the nose. Lemon rind and viscous sour apple flavors linger on the finish. For this range of flavors to work in harmony, you surely must count elegance and subtlety among its virtues.
This is a big Zinfandel, high in alcohol and packed with detail. Just erupts in a burst of blackberry jam, cherry pie filling, currant, milk chocolate and anise flavors, liberally dusted with fresh cracked peppercorn.
Here's a 2004 Chianti Classico (with a 15% component of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon for extra structure and smoothness) that delivers aromas of wet earth, white mushroom, blackberry, tobacco and leather. Drink it with stewed meats or game dishes.
Buttercup and tropical fruit aromas are related to the 80% Torrontés in this blend (Viognier and Chardonnay are 10% each). This is plump but also high in acidity. Salty flavors of tropical fruits and pink grapefruit are retained on the finish.
Calera's basic Central Coast Pinot is a good, drily crisp wine, showing some real elegance. A little heavy, it shows cherry, red currant, herb, tobacco, teriaki beef and sandalwood flavors. Drink now. More than 12,000 cases were produced.
A pretty, perfumed Pinot Noir, with gorgeous streaks of kir and vibrant blackberry and cherry. It's subtle and structured, with a pronounced layer of earthy forest floor on the finish. With sprinklings of spice, it dazzles from beginning to end.
Simple and fruity, this is a pleasant, easy-drinking table wine. The Barrel Select designation does not mean oaky.
This rosso offers plum and toast aromas, as well as a hint of coffee beans. The palate shows ripe plum and chocolate flavors. While this is warm and forward, it finishes with drying and astringent tannins.
More in the Champagne style, meaning the nose is yeasty and toasty, and the color is more gold than pale yellow. The palate offers wholesome apple, lemon and green herb flavors, and the finish is dry and peppery, with some bitterness. Strives for more complexity than most cavas, and it gets there for the most part.
Edging towards mineral, this is a perfumed Riesling, its white fruits bright and delicate, fitting well into the crisp acidity. It has a textured bite to it, bringing out the stony character. Worth aging 2–3 years.

Aromas of stone-fruit pit and citrus peel are punchy. This blend of Viura and Tempranillo Blanco feels solid. Pithy grapefruit and salty flavors carry over to the finish of this everyday white.
A pretty nose shows violet notes alongside leather, blackberry and cassis aromas. The palate is full and edgy, with rubbery tannins that could use some years to resolve. A roasted, beefy flavor profile includes nuances of smoked meat that make this about more than just black fruit. Drink through 2028.
New French oak sticks out on this Chardonnay, making the co-stars buttered toast and caramel. Underneath the wine is dry and brisk in acidity, with lime and mango fruit flavors.
Reustle makes four different versions of this wine, each distinctive and worthy of attention. This is vinified in all stainless, and pushes sappy tart flavors of Meyer lemon and grapefruit front and center. The fruit is ripe enough that it leaves an impression of sweetness—a perfect counterbalance to the wine's natural acidity.
Bold and delicious, this opens with earthy aromas of mature black-skinned fruit, truffle, scorched earth and a whiff of game. The savory, full-bodied palate doles out juicy black cherry, blackberry, licorice, and baking spice alongside bright acidity and refined tannins.

Grassy, this opens into pineapple and lemongrass flavors as well as lemon. It's got elysium (code for cat pee), too, but its racing minerality is worth seeking out, the wine simple, clean and balanced.
A stunningly rich yet balanced dessert wine, this beauty starts with hints of paraffin and almonds, then unleashes waves of sweet dried-apricot and orange-marmalade flavors. Despite the intense, honeyed sweetness, there's enough lime-like acidity to prevent it from being cloying. This tour de force should age effortlessly for 40 or more years.
This is the best of Laetitia's current sparklers. It's the smoothest and finest in texture, with a mouthfeel that's all silk and satin. The flavors, of raspberries, limes, smoky vanilla and yeast, are similar to the winery's other bottlings, but the fine smoothness shoots the point score up. Now through 2012.
Breathtaking lime acidity pierces through this ebulliently fruity kabinett. The palate is a crush of sweet, fresh yellow peach and apricot flavors, lined by a steely edge of minerality. It's fleeting and frail in mouthfeel yet packs a firm punch through a lingering finish. Drink now through 2020 to enjoy its youthful vitality.
A crisp wine that shows fresh plum and green berry fruits over a tight structure. It is restrained initially and then bursts with acidity. A definite wine of terroir, marked by finishing minerality. Imported by Weygandt-Metzler.
Murky, earthy aromas of plum and red berry feed into a creamy, saturated palate that's adequately balanced but not perfect. Syrupy blackberry, cassis and chocolate flavors end with spice and herbal notes. This is 70% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% each Merlot and Syrah.
Oaky aromas of chocolate, wet clay, plastic and graphite control the nose of this tannic, edgy Malbec that gets a boost from bright acidity. Oak-dominated flavors share the stage with earthy berry notes, while the finish tastes minty and woody. Drink through 2021.
In contrast to Tommasi's regular Amarone, this is a darker, richer, more brooding wine, loaded with chocolaty, fudge-like flavors and roasted fruit. It's mouthfilling and supple, with a lingering finish that bodes well for cellaring, although it's certainly approachable now.
Shows the soft acids, gentle tannins and herbaceousness that mark most Alexander Valley Cabs, with supporting cherry, red currant and licorice flavors. It's a complex wine, balanced and intriguing, and a fine pairing for a very wide variety of foods. Interestingly, indigenous, or wild, yeast was used for fermentation.
A big, ripe, saturated offering, the type of wine most red-wine enthusiasts want, and also the type of wine that has earned Argentina its reputation for making serious Malbec. The color is purple, the bouquet rubbery and smoky. The palate is dynamite; the black-fruit flavors are superb and the coffee and dark chocolate nuances just right. A stud of a wine that could use about a year in bottle to reach its peak.
A blend of Rkatsiteli and Mtsvane, this light-straw-colored wine has aromas of peach and freesia. It is very soft on the palate, with refreshing flavors of melon, clementine and passion fruit. The citrus finish offers a surprising touch of white chocolate.
Ripe wine, finely balanced with good acidity giving the concentrated black currant fruit a bright character. Tannins show well, a dry core layered with juicy fruit. Age for 2–4 years.
Thirst-quenching, lean and tangy, it would make a good match with shucked oysters. It shows lemon and green apple aromas, plus fresh and crisp citrus flavors. Medium in body, the texture is pleasantly lean while the finish is refreshing.
Pretty aromas of violet, rose and wild berry lead the nose. The bright but rather lean palate offers raw red berry, peppercorn and saline together with notes of dried sage. Astringent tannins create an abrupt finish.
Here's a simple but likeable blend of mainly Cabernet, with some Merlot and Petite Sirah. It's enormously ripe in blackberry jam, currant and spicy licorice flavors. Drink now.

This 70-30 blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon offers an extra layer of sophistication that sits like a veil of smoke and spice over a hearty core of quality fruit.

This is a good wine to drink if you want a modestly elegant Chardonnay to serve alongside food, instead of a big, oaky sweetie. It's dry and crisp and clean, with pleasantly rich flavors of citrus fruits, peaches, green apples, minerals and vanilla. Easy to find, with 17,000 cases produced.
Aromas suggest wildflower and woodland berry. The fruity palate delivers crushed wild cherry, strawberry and a tangerine note alongside bright acidity. Drink soon.
The winery has made SB since 1982, blending in Sémillon and barrel-aging in new oak to craft a fuller style of the wine that's well structured. In this vintage 16% Sémillon was used and barrel fermentation took place in 15% new oak. The result: a light, ethereal wine abundant in tropical aromas and flavors that's crisp on the palate.
This aromatic, Bordeaux-style blend is built from a generous mix of well-loved vineyards scattered across the Columbia Valley. Balanced and detailed, it combines fresh herbs, rhubarb, raspberry and tart acidity. The result is a young, still tight, well-structured wine with excellent aging potential through 2024.
This well-made wine shows good cherry fruit and a licorice or mint note on the nose.

Shows good length and some dusty tannins on the back end.
Only the second vintage of this wine, which sits above The Holy Trinity in the Grant Burge hierarchy. The 2003 is a blend of 36% Mataro, 33% Grenache and 31% Shiraz, showing hints of tea and cola on the nose to go with dark blackberry and coffee flavors. This is crisp and well-structured, with some drying tannins on the finish that suggest short-term cellaring. Drink 2010–2018.
Hints of rhubarb, earth and a certain nuttiness on the nose lead onto a rich, rounded and savory palate. Red, ripe apples star along with an earthy texture that yields a pleasant tinge of bitterness. This belongs firmly on the table.

While harmoniously dry on the palate, there's a fascinating interplay of sweet, candied orange peels and tea against darker tones of smoke and struck flint on this unusual Finger Lakes Riesling. Finishes quite brisk on a tart, raw quince note.
Intensely herbaceous, this is grassy, crisp, catty—all the flavors that come from young, cool-climate Sauvignon Blanc are here in bucketsful. It is delicious, refreshing and aromatic. Drink from 2015.
A wine with a light texture and character, this is very fresh and crisp. It has flavors of white berries, pears and red plums, with lemon zest acidity.

Pristine apple and lemon aromas are glazed with honey on this sprightly, fresh sweet Riesling. The palate gushes with juicy nectarine and peach flavors, but maintains brisk composure from start to finish.
The new vintage of Viuda Negra (literally, “black widow”) is a third each Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot. For a red wine it is a real fruitbowl of unusual flavors—peaches, cranberries, cherries soaked in rum. Round and full, quite delicious and yet focused into a finish with persistent, ageworthy tannins, this will be hard to keep in the cellar, but well worth it if you do.
This is a sweet, soft Port, with plenty of fruit. Sultana and orange jelly flavors are cut with some spirit. The wine leans much more towards fruit than wood, unusual for a 20-year old. The wine, like all aged tawnies, is ready to drink.
This wine offers a bouquet of canned peaches and tangerine zest. It is creamy on the palate, with a strong white peach flavor offset by nice vanilla notes.
Pure, alluring aromas of minerally black fruits, lavender, cola, fir tree and pepper combine to form a highly inviting bouquet.

Built upon generous, sweet and pretty cherry and cassis fruit, this drinks well now, but could be cellared until 2020. Tannins are ripe and polished, and the natural acidity carries a finishing lick of citrus.
A lightweight Pinot that's actually marketed as a rose, this wine nevertheless manages to pack in decent flavors of apple skin, red berries and cinnamon, capped off by some leathery, meaty notes.
While the aromas are earthy, with a farmyard character, the finely textured palate is fruitier. The tannins give a firm, structured base for the red currant flavor. Solid and rich, this is now maturing, but it retains its youthful acidity.
This is a rustic, soft Cabernet. It tastes hotter than the official alcohol level, which is 14.5%, giving heat to the blackberry and prune flavors.

Appealing aromas of citrus rind and pear lead to fleshy full-fruit flavors. The alcohol pokes through at times but it still provides enjoyment.
Natural characteristics of the Primitivo grape include bold fruit tones of blackberry and blueberry, backed by plush sweetness and dark richness. Rudiae offers all of those qualities with added spice notes from oak aging in large wooden casks.
Sultry black-cherry and berry flavors and ripe deeply integrated tannins are held upright by a strident backbone of acidity in this elegantly structured Cabernet Franc.

A solidly structured rosé with a bit of weight and great ripeness in the mouth. Strawberry and somewhat medicinal cherry fill the bouquet and palate, with a touch of herbaceousness on the finish.
Sonoma County's Coturri, an early advocate of organic farming and old-fashioned winemaking, has made a tiny amount of Charbono, a hybrid of Nebbiolo and Grenache. Grown at Testa in Mendocino, a great source of many heritage varieties, including Zinfandel and Carignane, this Charbono is grapey and rustic with a fair amount of acidity throughout.
An excellent white-wine choice for any occasion, this bottling offers a complex nose, showing Gala apples, tart honeydew, nectarine, red apple, hay and an intriguing touch of celery. It's clean and tight on the palate, which offers a soft and yet grippy texture, and reveals flavors of Granny Smith apple and wild stonefruit.
A solid value in dry Riesling (keep in mind that the bottle is one-third larger than standard). The ripe apple scents lead into dry minerally flavors that boast rounded, smooth edges. Purists may gripe that it lacks a certain precision because of this, but others will find it more accessible and easier to drink for precisely the same reason. Imported by Chapin Cellars.
Ripe and seductive with cherries and sweet cranberries, this young, tight, stylish Pinot has nothing but clear sailing ahead. There's excellent concentration through the midpalate, a light touch with the new oak, and beautifully textured fruit throughout. Love it now or leave it for later; you can't lose either way.

This is a structured style of rosé with a tannic edge as well as red-currant flavors. It is fruity, dry and with fine refreshing acidity to finish this fragrant wine. Drink now.
A beautifully rich, complex mountain wine that wants some time in the cellar. Dry and complex in tannin structure, it shows flamboyant blackberry, cherry, raspberry, chocolate, roasted almond and brown sugar flavors, as delicious as a succulent granola candy bar. Already throwing some sediment, it's fine now and should develop at least through 2015.
This wine doesn't seem to have fully evolved and its aromas are  muddled in places with notes of mature fruit and natural rubber. In the mouth it has red fruit flavors and tight tannins, but it generally lacks definition.
At nearly four years of age, this Pinot is in an awkward phase. Tasted in March, it was dry, tannic and oaky, with powerful red fruit and mocha flavors. There's a distinctly funky, animal note that lends interest. Hold until 2015 or so.

Light in color and sizzling in Asian spice, this wine is made by Sam Spencer from a variety of top-notch vineyard sites, including Durell and Wildcat Canyon, as well as locales farmed by the Sangiacomos.

The aromas of ground granite, dark raspberries, plum and pencil lead have not yet fully unfurled but still offer immediate allure. Flavors are saturated and layered, with the tannins providing some heft. It's a serious wine that provides a whole lot of enjoyment and that should benefit from time in the cellar.
Coming from the more northerly parts of Burgundy, this is cool Chardonnay, with steel and minerality. It is firmly textured, its apple and quince flavors coming with a more citrus element.
The bouquet starts off snappy and clean, but with time some pungent sea foam and green-bean aromas arise. Basic pear, melon and green herbs make up the flavor profile, while the short finish, though offering ample pepper and mineral, is lacking in fruit.
Smoky, dark and rich, this oak-aged Ripasso is packed tight with savory aromas of barbecue smoke, bresaola, licorice and sun-dried fruit. There's a sweet note on the close followed by smooth, soft tannins.
Bright acidity firm tannins are backed by jammy fruit aromas and a healthy dose of spicy oak tones. The intensity is here but the integration is slightly off for a wine of this importance.
A little too sweet, too rustic and too soft for a higher score. There are also notes of over-ripeness.
A little sweet in apricot, orange and pineapple flavors, like a fruit juice blend. But it's refreshingly crisp at an everyday price.
The high proportion of Merlot in Pichon Lalande is a good reason why this wine, among the great wines of Pauillac, is always so seductive. This is no exception; it charms as well as excites with vibrant fruits as well as serious, dense tannins and acidity that promise good aging. Give it 7–9 years for full maturity to begin.
You never quite know what you're getting with Barbera. Imagery's is absolutely dry and quite firm in dusty tannins, with a complex array of berry, herb, tobacco, cured meat and spice flavors. It's pretty much as sophisticated as California Barbera gets.
With hard tannins and a jagged mouthfeel, this Merlot tastes fairly simple in cherry and cola flavors, accented with sweet oak. Drink now.

The Amarones from Zonin have been consistently good the past few vintages, and this one is no exception, offering dark plum-prune and chocolate notes laced with hints of spice and tobacco. It's round and mouthfilling without being unstructured, giving the impression that it has more to give in another few years. Tastes dry, unlike some Amarones these days.
Strongly woody at this stage, this wine does have the potential to reveal ripe fruits and a generous structure. Smoky flavors are beginning to balance with broad red fruits and acidity. Drink from 2018.
Give this Pinot Noir some time to breathe and mellow in a decanter. Right out of the bottle, it's tough, tannic and jammy in raspberry and cherry flavors. But it doesn't take long for it to pick up some complexities. This wine's rich, sweet oakiness will pair well with steaks, lamb chops and mushroom risottos.
This is a sweet, raw blend of Syrah, Grenache, Petite Sirah, Mourvèdre and Cinsault. Not going anywhere.
This a pretty good effort for the price, offering authentic Pinot Noir scents of ripe cherries, marked by hints of bacon and briar. It's plump and round in the mouth, just somewhat lacking in textural richness.

Sorry to steal the moniker from the company's Shiraz, but this is Classic Clare too, offering bold flavors of honey-coated minerals perked up by curls of lime zest. Firmly built and close to dry, you can drink it now for its power and fruit, or hold it up to 10 years or more, if you like your Australian Rieslings with more age on them.
Hard to like for its sweetness, bitterness and harsh tannins, which combine to make it a small, rustic country wine.
Consistent with the previous year, this Syrah-led blend is average at best, with sweet, foxy aromas of candied fruit. Feels chunky and tannic, with herb-infused, heavily extracted berry flavors. Herbal and peppery on the finish.
The first two things you notice are how delicious the flavors are and how gentle the tannins are. Blackberries, cherries, raspberries and mulberries mingle with 80% new oak to provide a thrill of a palate experience. As for those tannins, they're as ripe and sweet as a hot vintage and modern viticulture can provide, but this wine should do all sort of interesting things over the next 10 years.
This site continues to wow, especially when featured by this grower-producer. Light, bright and lemony in initial aroma and flavor, it develops additional complexity and nuance in the glass, alighting in apple crumble, anise and mouthfilling succulence, the minerality well defined and vibrantly fresh.
Ken Wright produces more than a dozen single-vineyard Pinots in any given vintage. This wine, which sells for a fraction of the cost of those wines, uses many of the same grapes.

Here's a ripe, oaky Cabernet brimming with the flavors of black currants, cherries, chocolate and oak that make Cab America's most popular red wine. It's fully dry, and could develop bottle complexity over the next six years.
A full-bodied, rounded wine with some good crisp acidity to balance. It has flavors of pears and some spice, leaving an attractive fresh feel in the mouth.
A beautiful rendition of pure Cabernet Sauvignon, crafted from the oldest blocks of this iconic vineyard. Bracing, youthful and compact, it sends up a fascinating mix of dusty spices, black fruits and elegant barrel flavors of toast and coconut butter. Beautiful balance and length.
Pretty honest on the nose, where it's mostly melony, peachy fruit and no faux oak. The palate is on the sharp side, with blazing acidity and not much body to go with citrus and apple flavors. Hits you with a lot of juiciness and aggression but doesn't bring a lot of mouthfeel and complexity.
This is toasty, full and cidery on the nose, with matchstick harshness in the background. The mouth is full and round, while flavors of apple and spice carry a yeasty heaviness. On the finish, things taste dry and don't evolve.

Don Anselmo is among Basilicata's most important wines because it does a phenomenal job of highlighting the potential of this volcanic territory and the Aglianico grape.

A solid, earthy, dusty, lightly leathery Cabernet Sauvignon. Though perhaps not technically perfect, it captures the palate imagination with texture and detail, and a light touch which keeps the alcohol around 14% and the tannins proportionate. No massive new oak here either, though the (virtually impossible to read) back label notes that it was made in 100% French oak, half of it new.
From the well-known Zinfandel producer, this floral Chardonnay is high in balanced minerality and marked by darker, riper pear and apple fruit. The finish is swathed in vanilla bean and toast.

Terre Rouge's annual best of the best barrels is luxurious in leather and smoky oak, grippy tobacco flirting through the midpalate through to the end. Concentrated in brambly black fruit and a core of gamy meat, it'll expand its world in due time, the layers of complexity like an Escher sketch, with no discernible end.
This broad, muscular blend is sourced from seven vineyards and aged for 18 months in French oak. It's relatively open and fruity, with berries, earth and spice all in proportion through a gentle fade.
Fresh, clean and varietal, this pushes fleshy pear flavors with a light hint of grapefruit. The presence in the mouth is full and satisfying, with a touch of honeysuckle, and the juicy finish lingers deliciously.

Plum, blackberry and citric flavors are short and tart, while the finish is light in step, with juicy acidity. This is solid for a 2008, a notoriously difficult vintage. Drink through 2024.
Claret is the old-fashioned word for Bordeaux, but it has no legal meaning in the U.S. This Cabernet-based wine contains some Syrah, which gives a smoked meat or bacon note to the blackberries and black currants. It's delicious, if a little sweet.
An appealing Chard at a price that won't break the bank, this  offers slightly toasty aromas, but also loads of citrus, melon and nectarine. It's nicely balanced, and the judicious oaking should make it very versatile at the table. Drink now.

There is the tang of zest and the bright juiciness of lemon fruit. The palate is concentrated and taut, submerging any earthy tones to end in brisk, clean freshness.
A rock-solid Malbec with attractive yet simple aromas of black cherry and raspberry. The palate is juicy and fresh, but with enough body to provide a sense of richnes. Forward tasting, with pure berry flavors and a hint of chocolate. The perfect wine for pizza, pasta or grilled meats.
With moderate alcohol, this Pinot is silky and delicate in the mouth, with excellent acidity. Yet it's intense in sunshiney-ripe raspberries and cherries, as well as a hint of mushrooms that will become more pronounced with age. Defines the lighter style of California Pinot, in a gracious, elegant style.
A bit Old World in style, with a touch of leafiness to the nose along with hints of earth, leather, olive and dried red fruits.

The grapes used are Lodi Rules certified green sustainable.
Here's a great deal from central Italy. Dark with mature fruit and spice, this easy red wine would pair with pork or white meat. It offers a pleasing touch of rich sweetness on the close.

Full, robust layers of black cherry and peppery tannins figure prominently on the palate of this fruit-forward wine that also manages to be lively in acidity. Spicy clove, black pepper and toasted oak add complexity and depth.

Noteworthy for lush, slightly sweet flavors of mashed black cherries, espresso and dark chocolate, this gooey Grenache is from a well-known vineyard. It's smooth as velvet, with a polished mouthfeel. The alcohol is very high, but the wine handles it well.
From a hillside spot, this blends in 21% Zinfandel for further fruitiness, showing aromas and a taste of dried plum, the tannins upfront and generous. Structured and medium bodied, it aged almost two years in French oak that provides additional spiciness and grace.
A full-bodied wine with a style that incorporates richness in the aromas and restraint in the flavors. It smells sweet and candylike, but tastes dry and oaky. A touch of walnut on the palate adds an austerity that is smoothed over on the finish with a dash of sweet oak.
Mellow, ripe Comice pear on the nose leads into a soft, expressive yet light-bodied palate that has slight spritz, subtle, pear-scented flavors and a mellowing earthiness surrounded by overtones of dandelion and jasmine. At the center there is acidic verve. This is very elegant and very balanced.
The aromas are so light you need to strain to get at them, with notes of vanilla, coffee and cherry. The palate brings plentiful coffee and cherry flavors that show a pleasing sense of texture. One wants more aromatically, but the palate delivers.
This tastes barely ripe, with a vegetal flavor compromsing the chocolate and cherry notes. It's soft, making it fall a little flat in the mouth.
Warming spice, cedar and pepper aromas are followed by flavors of coffee, mocha, tobacco and cocoa in this appetizing red. Balanced and distinctive, the wine has aging potential. A thinking person's red.

This is a single-vineyard expression of Dolcetto that offers a dark, inky appearance and rich aromas of dark chocolate, spice, black cherry, blackberry pie and a touch of dark licorice. The finish is extra smooth and opulent.
Always one of the best Sauvignon Blancs in California, the '05 is a stunner. It brings new levels of richness and complexity to a variety that can be simple even in the best of hands. With 15% Sémillon, the wine explodes with zesty tangerine, lemon tart, coconut pie and smoky oak flavors, with an  edge of wintergreen. The finish is absolutely dry. A triumph.
Earthy wine that has rich, chewy fruit, its tannins a serious element. There is weight as well, the wine ripe, full, with juicy plum flavors.
Fresh notes of ripe red apple and juicy pear rise from the glass and also swish freely across the palate. The body is slender, pervaded by a friendly invigorating zestiness that stays right through the dry finish.
In general, Eola Hills Pinots lean more to the peppery and herbal side of the line, compared with pricier AVAs in Yamhill county. This well-made wine shows good color and concentration, and it's ripe enough that the herbaceousness is a feature, if not entirely an asset. There's a nice lift to the midpalate, which leaves a residual impression that finishes a bit vinegary, as the wine winds down into flavors of black olive and herb.
Here is an easygoing, mineral-driven wine with drying notes of slate and graphite followed by measured tones of exotic fruit and honey. The mouthfeel is tight, crisp and a tad watery.
Malolactic fermentation and oak aging have made this wine sweetly buttery and rich, with underlying waves of mangoes, Meyer lemons, pineapples and papayas. It's a big, flamboyant Chardonnay.
There's a burnt, ashy smell and taste to this wine that makes it tough to like. If you can get past that, the wine is dry, crisp and tannic, with wild cherry, cola and cedar flavors. A huge disappointment. Tasted twice.
A perfect dry white wine for warm weather sipping, when a cold salad or assortment of salty cheeses and snacks are on the menu. Gooseberry, grapefruit and a touch of white peach fruit flavors anchor this racy, ripe and refreshing wine.
Neutral on the nose except for a smidgen of lychee and citrus. The palate is standard and generic, with bland peach, melon and pithy flavors. Finishes light and peachy, with weight and fading acidity.
The Baker's Gully Syrah is the entry-level offering from Clarendon Hills, but it remains a very good wine. It's medium to full in weight, with some alcoholic warmth and hints of slightly raisined fruit, yet charms for its velvety-soft tannins and aromas of chocolate and baking spices. Drink now.
You'll find luscious flavors of sour red cherries, anise, pecan pie, cola and smoke in this dry wine. But it's a little too soft, structurally, which will limit development. Drink now.
Soft, gentle and fruity, a dry, polished Merlot that's a pretty good buy for the price. Shows nice flavors of blackberries, currants, anise, herbs and oak.
This begins with compelling aromas of rose petals and breakfast tea. Those tea-like tannins underscore an elegant wine with subtle fruit flavors. A delicate dance partners the fresh cherry fruit, the baking spices and other barrel-influenced accents, soft but penetrating tannins and the lightly chalky minerality. Lovely already, it should continue to drink well through 2025.
A wine that is in an in-between stage from youthful freshness to maturity. There is sweetness, a layer of botrytis, crisp sweet apple character, fading and becoming more toffee-like. The acidity, though, remains. Wait another year.
Red fruit, cassis and sweet rubbery notes define the ripe bouquet. Feels medium to full in size, with leafy flavors mixed with plum, vanilla and oak. Red fruits including strawberry and raspberry work the mildly oaky finish.
Musky violet perfume and dusty mineral tones collide on the nose of this slightly sweet Gewürztraminer. Deft body and fresh tangerine and grapefruit flavors are pleasing but the finish is a bit earthy and muddy.
This soft, ripe perfumed wine has a fine, clean texture of apple skins. Orange zest and a citrus acidity come through strongly in this wine that is bright and fresh at the end. Drink now.
A big, flashy wine that's fabulously rich in flavors of pineapple, orange and lemon custard, and liberally accented with the crème brûlée and vanilla from it's time in new French oak. Fresh acidity, minerality from the soil and a dry finish bring an elegant touch to this ripe Chardonnay.
After almost losing a finger struggling to remove the rock-hard faux wax “capsule” I found this strawberry/cherry cordial-flavored wine quite pleasant. The fruit, from a Rattlesnake Hills vineyard, has a sweet core, while the tannins add an earthy streak of green tea.
Aromas recalling pressed rose, grilled herb and scorched soil come together in the glass. The tannic palate is completely closed and rather bitter, revealing only suggestions of powdered sage and the warmth of alcohol.
From a parcel within the Kirchberg de Barr Grand Cru, this is a structured, serious Gewuztraminer. It has weight as well as sweetness, but it's the potential and ageability that is so impressive. Spice and gingerbread notes, as well as fine acidity, lend complexity to the honeyed, yellow fruits. Drink from 2016.
Thea's Selection book-ends the single-vineyard wines and is the winery's lower-priced, multi-vineyard blend. As with the Jerome, the flavors are more complex and woven than in the single-vineyard bottlings; with cherry and berry fruit, fresh herb and streaks of bitter chocolate.

Considered on their own, d'Arenberg's 2011 single-vineyard Shirazes are successful, although they lack some of the pizzazz of the 2010s. This was one of my favorites, teeming with pepper-tinged blueberries and accented by hints of roasted meat and espresso. It's full bodied and richly textured, with a long, velvety finish.
This new vineyard-designate from Saintsbury has a classic profile. Spicy, woodsy, cherrylike aromas lead to layered raspberry, cinnamon and cherry flavors, with the firm texture of fine-grained tanins and good acidity. It offers a lightly tart and lingering finish.

Already drinking nicely, this offers generously ripened peach, candied lemon and pineapple fruits. The lush flavors are balanced against fresh, natural acidity, with little or no time in new oak apparent.
Quite floral despite having spent 14 months in French oak. With 15% Maipo fruit in the blend, the wine veers toward raspberry and cherry, while the finish is darker, dealing licorice and some fudge. Has the right acid-tannin balance. Powerful enough without being tough.
Cocoa-dusted black cherry and berry aromas hit you first in the bouquet, followed by soft notes of black tea, violets and licorice shortly after. Full and rich in the mouth, the fruit is intense and juicy, framed by a lush but firm structure and balanced acidity hinting at the life that this wine still has to come. Long finish with a peppery back note.
Aromas of white pepper and pear start it off, and it smells snappy and inviting. The palate is all about grapefruit and orange; in a word, it's citrusy. The finish comes in waves, with notes of stone fruit and licorice. As a whole it's round and satisfying, but it's also a tad bit dilute and dull, which is why it rates where it does.
Sharp acidity underscores light, quite tart cranberry fruit. This has herbal notes in abundance, and an earthy note to the tannins. But it all comes together with a clean, polished finish.
A true cuvée, this wine combines 55% Merlot with 20% Cabernet Sauvignon, 13% Cabernet Franc, 9% Petit Verdot and 3% Malbec. Pretty and floral on the nose, it offers red cherry and strawberry alongside high-toned cranberry, finishing piquantly racy in acidity and smooth.

Oaky and direct in ripe tropical fruit, with a gooseberry taste more akin to Sauvignon Blanc, this Chard is unripe and simple.
Here is a bright, spicy, floral, vivid example of Washington Gewürztraminer. It's fresh as a spring breeze, clean and fruity, but substantial, with defining flavors of citrus rind, mint and pineapple. There is just a hint of the soapy, floral side of the grape, but the wine has substance and weight and it lingers beautifully.
Punchy lime and lemon mark this off-dry Riesling with a staccato rhythm, adding edge to honeyed tones of peach and honeysuckle. Exceptionally priced, it's satisfying and elegant.
Here's an earthy, dark red with soft tannins that's perfectly approachable now. Menthol, blackberries, cassis and leathery spice fill the nose and mouth, with moderate weight and a medium finish. A nice choice for grilled or herb-crusted lamb chops.
Burnt-match aromas meld with burnt coffee on the nose, lending a slightly off note to this otherwise very fine wine. Black cherry and mushroom flavors are wrapped in a soft, supple package that reflects the great ripeness achieved in the 2000 vintage.

Now at its peak of maturity, this is a gorgeous toast and spice flavored Champagne. It has richness, refined acidity, a powerful concentration of yeasty almonds, a taut texture and a final flavor that is straight, true, perfectly balanced.
For an old wine from a weak vintage, this has its positives. For starters, the nose offers a nice mix of dried fruit, tobacco, cedar and fig paste, while the palate is properly acidic and tastes of red plum, raspberry and oak-driven vanilla. At its drinking peak now; with preserved juiciness and lots of kick.
Part of the impressive series of Jubilée wines that are aged before release, this Hugel Riesling is just getting to maturity with its soft aromatic character, touch of toastiness, and refreshing herbal flavors. It's now ready to drink, although it will be even better from 2016.
This lightly aromatic wine conveys ripe red apple, pear, and star fruit. The fruit flavors are centered in a ball in the middle, offering plenty of appeal if not much complexity.
Pure berry and plum aromas are nuanced by notes of tobacco, cedar and spice. This wine is tight and rock solid on the palate, with laser-like focus. Flavors of plum, blackberry and toasty oak finish woody, smoky and resiny. Best from 2016 through 2023.
A good, classy Cabernet that should develop some bottle complexity in the cellar. It's dry and elegant in Napa tannins, with intensely concentrated blackberry and cassis flavors. Too strong to drink now, unless you don't care about subtlety. Try giving it 4–6 years.
Principally Cabernet Franc, it's tight and reductive, with a tarry note. In the mouth it is surprisingly soft, almost silky, offering plummy fruit flavors that seem to be quickly maturing. Drink soon.
It's not often that you get the chance to try an aged Malbec for this price. The nose is sweet but also a bit soupy, while the palate is lively and delivering mature flavors of stewed cherry, cassis and raisin. Long on the finish, with brown sugar notes. A wine with finesse and restraint to drink now.
Bright floral and tropical flavors are enveloped in a lush sweetness here, creating an overall character that is not complex, but is appealing. Could use a little acid to tighten and lighten the structure and cut the heavy-handed sweetness, but the wine will pair nicely with a spicy Asian salad or a salty cheese.
Offers an intriguing nose with ginger, lime and floral elements. The mouthfeel is ephemeral—almost too light—but there’s a good case to be made for this style when bubbles are involved. Green apple, an almost lilac note, and lime on the palate. Finishes nicely, too.
This Brut expression of Prosecco is easy and tight in the mouth with fresh floral fragrances of jasmine and white rose as well as fruity tones of stone fruit and lemon. The mouthfeel is tight, sharp and compact.
Owned by the Rouzaud family of Roederer Champagne, this has become a model Saint-Estèphe. It has all the initial tannins that dominate wines from this appellation. But it supports these tannins with elegant, ripely juicy black fruit and an addition of licorice sweetness. Age for 3-4 years.
A project by Joey Tensley and Alex Guarachi, this is a whopper of a wine for the price tag. Black cherry, oregano, eucalyptus and dried sage show on the nose. The palate packs a mix of herbal seasonings, including anise and spearmint, alongside black cherry and baked blueberry fruit.
Made from 45-year-old Pinot Noir, this intensely perfumed wine is fresh, with bitter cherry and smoky flavors. There is some toast from the 12 months in wood, but the final impression is of red fruits and light acidity.
Fruity and bursting with ripe red berries, this young Chianti offers freshness and simplicity. It tastes tart and firm on the tongue and imparts easy flavors of cherry, almond and spice.
Aromas of forced oak, plastic and berry fruits don't forecast how tight, shrill and acidic the palate is. Snappy flavors of red plum and red currant teeter on being sour, while acidity is what keeps this cranking through a sharp, oaky finish.
Nothing shy about this wine. It erupts like a fruit volcano, offering wave after wave of raspberries, cherries and ripe persimmons, sweetened with vanilla and butterscotch tones of oak. The mouthfeel is all silk and satin. Drink now for sheer pleasure.

Winemaker Holly Turner has a good touch with Malbec, finding the soft fruit core in the midst of the herbal scents and tannins. Plums, brambleberries and a dusting of licorice keep the wine interesting on through the smoky, earthy, extended finish.
Gritty, rubbery aromas seem underripe given how warm and generous 2011 was. In the mouth, this is gravelly and like sandpaper. Burnt gritty berry flavors are saucy, while this tastes of herbal berry fruits and oak on the finish.
A beautiful wine, a pure expression of ripe but steely Chardonnay. The wine floats onto the palate, with green plums and citrus leading. Then come toast, a mouthwatering acidity and a mineral structure. This wine's complexity just continues to impress.
Yeasty at first, this Lodi Zin from Napa's Cosentino Winery is dense and on the clove and ultraripe blackberry side of the Zin spectrum, decently simple in its intensity.
This wine is unabashedly forward with sweet, juicy, stonefruit intensity, yet remarkably composed. Delicately structured, it's anchored with piercing citrus acidity and a bristle of crushed-stone and slate minerality on the finish.

Slightly sweet and quite light in body, this wine has modest peach and herb aromas, generic fruit flavors and a soft texture.
Having seen 20 months in French oak, the aromas of this wine are dominated by cola and rooibos tones. The light- to medium-bodied palate shows more fruit tones, with juicy red cherry and black currant taking on an almost candied flavor. Sandy tannins and a line of acidity give enough support to keep this Pinot in check.
This best-barrel blend spent 16 months in 40% new oak, and is comprised of fruit from the Nysa and Lachini vineyards, which are also featured as vineyard designate bottlings for this new project from Mark McNeilly (of Mark Ryan Winery). The oak is showing strongly at the moment, with baking spices galore, suggesting gingerbread cookies and dried cherries. The tannins could use a bit more bottle age to soften up, but it's built to last. Drink 2020–2030.
Steely mineral notes accent luscious white grapefruit and yellow nectarine flavors on the nose of this delicate, yet lushly textured spätlese. It's softly sweet, with hints of honey and peach nectar, but bristling with acidity. A surprising bargain buy from Karl Josef.
An awesome rosé, just a tremendous feat. Made from 11 vineyards in 4 counties, it shows a masterful art of the blend. Insanely rich in toasted bread and lees, showing the influence of six years in the bottle. A tremendous core of strawberries, raspberries, orange zest, roasted macadamia, roasted coconut, pear liqueur and honey lasts into the finish. Despite the richness, the wine is dry. So lovely now you can hardly keep your hands off, but it should age gracefully for the next 10–15 years.
Fiore di Campo is a blended white wine from northeast Italy and as its Italian name suggests, there are indeed many aromas here that recall fresh field flowers. Distant accents of dried hay, crushed mineral and citrus fill out the background.
Smooth and ripe, this is full of red fruits that are layered with wood influence and attractive tannins. It has an enticing juicy character, with its soft texture bearing a spice note and fine acidity on the finish.
Given more time in bottle, this wine is blended with 25% Cabernet Sauvignon. A smokiness permeates the bouquet initially, before a more floral, violet perfume weighs in. Tannic and concentrated, the wine is also subtle in herb and tobacco, with a layering of cassis and raspberry.
A fruit-driven style, showing plenty of black cherries, accented by cola, herb and spice notes. The palate is pleasantly smooth and satiny in texture before turning tart on the finish. Drink now-2010.
Musky pear aromas start things off, but the flavors are in sharper focus—a blend of pears and green herbs, finishing with a touch of anise. A bit sweet-tasting, so serve well-chilled as an apéritif. Best Buy.
This blend of 77% Zinfandel, 14% Syrah, 8% Petite Sirah and 1% Grenache is a solid choice at this price. Vibrant fruit tones of strawberry, cranberry, black raspberry and mulberry mix with exotic vanilla and clove on the nose. Juicy and fresh flavors of pine-smoked blackberries give a peat-like character to the palate.
Plenty ripe, in fact it's on the edge of raisiny but not quite over the line. The palate runs surprisingly racy with a lot of acidity, yet the flavor profile is short and drying. Shows a flash or two but it's not a complete wine and not worth the high price tag.
This opens with aromas of toast, coconut and raw red cherry that carry over to the palate along with notes of vanilla and clove. Bracing tannins give it a firm finish.
It took the utmost talent to succeed in this vintage, when rains hampered so many late-ripening reds. Mondavi did their best to rise above this. Shows master touches of tannin management and the most perfect barrel regimen. It has some modest blackberry flavors, but is obviously a wine of charm rather than longevity.
Strong barrel-driven aromas of clove and wood spice sit atop ripe berry fruit scents. This Pinot Noir is chewy, plump and on the heavy side. Oaky berry and plum flavors come with spicy clove notes that don't quit on the finish.
A bitingly fresh wine, like eating a green apple in the wind, this rosé bursts into the mouth, very crisp, with lime zest and grapefruit. To soften all this crispness, there is just a touch of sweet caramel as the wine opens up.
This wine is rather stalky and pickled. The nose deals burning haystack, while the palate is mildly drawing and astringent, with stalky, briny tasting red berry flavors. It's briny on the finish as well.
Fragrances recall underbrush, espresso, tilled soil, red berry and dried sage. The monolithic palate delivers coffee bean, vanilla, licorice and toast alongside astringent wood tannins.
Hard and fiery, with spearmint dominating the nose. Raw and jumpy in the mouth, with hard berry and coffee flavors. Not much else to say about this tough wine; it's a fighter not a lover. Imported by USA Wine Imports.
This is light, with a nose of fresh stone fruit—mostly peach—as well as melon. It's a delightful blend of 75% Sauvignon Blanc and 25% Sémillon that will appeal to Sémillon fans. iIts acidity is balanced and bracing; the finish is full of lemon flavor.
One of a pair of wines under the Grilos name, this Dão is solid and tannic, still young, with a firm core of dryness surrounded by a more fruity black cherry component. It needs aging for a year.
This is richer than most Pinot Grigios. It opens with aromas of toast, yellow flower, vanilla and a balsamic note while the round, full-bodied palate offers baked yellow apple, candied lemon drop, nectarine zest and almond. Fresh acidity brightens the creamy fruit while a vanilla note closes the finish. You can barely detect the warmth of alcohol on the close.
Made from single (777) clone, organically-grown grapes, the Blackjack Block Pinot Noir is focused and complex. The mid-palate shows flesh and fat, ripe berry and cherry fruit, with a backing of citrusy acids. Its middle is its strength; it would benefit from blending to add more depth to both front and back.
Typical of Swanson, there's noticeable toasty wood up front. Plums, currants and cranberry comprise the predominantly red-fruit palate. Finishes trim and precise, with fine-grained tannins and stylish oak. Wood-driven, but with plenty of other good things going for it.
One of the Central Coast's best deals each vintage, this blend of 53% Grenache and 47% Syrah shows candied cherries, cinnamon, scarlet red roses, slate and earthy clay notes on the nose. The palate also shows some clay as well as dense boysenberry fruit and touches of lavender and pepper.
This opens with classic Sangiovese aromas of blue flower, ripe berry, tilled earth and a whiff of leather. The palate delivers black cherry, savory herb, espresso and a hint of tobacco alongside bracing tannins. Drink 2016–2021.
A 50-50 blend of Nero d'Avola and Merlot that suffers from an initial pungent smell reminiscent of garlic but that blows off later and yields wet earth, pipe tobacco and tea leaf. Imported by Paterno Wines International.
Charming raspberry aromas intertwine with scents of green herbs and smoke, then pick up hints of espresso. This medium-bodied Syrah ends with pretty berry shadings and a silky texture. Drink now and over the next several years.
Tough and gritty in the mouth, with rustic flavors of berries, herbs, tobacco and mint. Okay for everyday purposes.
Light in color, this rejoices in its perfumed character as much as its fruit. There is a heady smoky aroma, while the palate shows a leaner character. The fruit flavors of red berries are given an extra dimension by the smoky wood and the meaty edge.
This Cabernet has rich blackberry-jam and black licorice flavors, and it also has a funky bacon note. The oak provides a pleasant backdrop of sweet toast. This shows how well Cabernet can perform on the far Sonoma Coast, which is now  more oriented to Pinot Noir.
From the mighty Hyde in Carneros, this medium-bodied white blossoms with tropical fruit and briny minerality, a forceful combination that gives this wine both power and elegance. Textured in candied Meyer lemon, it finishes crisply and the right kind of sour.
Floral and fruity on the nose, with a strong bouquet of cassis, blackberry and ink. The palate has depth and power but also good feel, and the flavors of blackberry and dark plum are pure and accented by cocoa and cola. Toasty, dark and long on the finish.
Not clear what the varietal blend is, but it's like a nice, easy southern Rhône wine. Soft and fruity, it's rich in jammy blackberry, cherry, Mandarin orange, chocolate and anise spice flavors.
A structured wine, this reflects the granite soil of the Dão. Fruit from seven vineyards is blended to make this firm, tannin- and black-currant-driven selection. Perfumes from the Touriga Nacional lend lift to the finish.
Displays plenty of cola and earth aromas upfront, balanced by hints of pepper and a core of blackberry fruit. A solid, medium-bodied effort that's not overweight or overripe, just a nice, easy-drinking Shiraz with some earthy character. Drink now–2015.
Complex and composed, this vineyard-designate wine is brightly decorated in flavors of grapefruit pith and lemon zest, with zippy acidity. As it develops in the glass, richer elements of peach and apricot flesh out the palate with succulent aplomb.
88-90 Barrel sample. While there is plenty of good, structured, dry tannins here, the fruit is more of a question. It seems to need greater ripeness, unusual for 2005. All the right flavors are there, but not quite the richness you would expect.
This is one of the rare dry Australian Rieslings that's not so taut that it demands cellaring, and might just be at its best now. Aromas of beeswax and petrichor give way to flavors of honey, apple and citrus on the palate, while the finish boasts a rich, gravelly texture.
Marchesi di Barolo delivers a rich, concentrated expression from the Serragrilli cru with mature cherry and candied fruit aromas along with bright nuances of Spanish cedar, barbecue spice and cigar box. The wine is astringent at this young age, but has the pulp and heft for a long aging future. Drink after 2017.
91–93. Barrel sample. This is a solid, tannic wine that's deeply concentrated and somewhat dark in style. The juicy blackberry fruits are constrained by a tight structure, minerality and a severe shell. The wine will need time to show it's true potential.
Broad and toasty, the 2008 Andreas is pure Cabernet Sauvignon from the Wallula Vineyard. Lush plum and cherry fruit is set against generous, toasty new oak. Nuanced highlights of herb, rye seed and even a dash of cayenne peek through on the finish. The wine spent a full year in bottle prior to release, but could certainly age for another decade or more, and is likely to improve significantly.
Spicy and briary, suggesting wild forest berries, nettles, chamomile, bitter greens and black pepper. Drink this exotically dry, tannic wine with roast lamb prepared with garlic and rosemary.

From lower Howell Mountain, this 100% Cab has bigtime tannins and tremendous authority. It's dry, shut down and slightly rustic now, with an edgy feel, but the core of ripe Cabernet fruit suggests that it will blossom and improve by 2008, and then hold until at least 2015.
Here's an elegant, drying Prosecco Brut (with 10% Bianchetta and 5% Verdiso) that delivers pretty mineral linearity backed by a beautiful embroidery of flowers and yellow fruit. The wine is clean and crisp with zesty lemon on the close.

This isn't a big Pinot Noir. It's not dark or heavy or soft. This cool part of the Russian River doesn't yield such wines. It's light in tannins and silky in the mouth, the essence of Pinot Noir. Official alcohol is 14.4%, which seems about right. For all that, it's very rich in cherry pie filling, cola, sweet tobacco, spice and sandalwood flavors, and should develop over the next 3–5 years.

Textural and deep rather than overtly fruity, this single-vineyard Pinot Gris leads with a mix of dried herbs, citrus and melon flavors. It's an interesting wine, with depth and persistence, more like an Italian Pinot Grigio than a West Coast Pinot Gris.
Displaying great fruit and excellent structure, this can be enjoyed now, but it has soon scale and intensity that we suggest aging it for at least another year or two.

A crisp wine that brings out bright green apple fruit flavors, the freshest acidity on top of a light texture. There is some creaminess as well, broadening out the freshness of the wine. Screwcap.

Youthful and bright now, this elegant wine will surely benefit from five to ten more years of cellar aging. At this point, the wine is very focused on oak-driven aromas of spice, cedar, chocolate, old leather and toasted nut but the quality of the fruit comes through. Drink with succulent red meats.
Herbaceous and crisp, this is a tangy wine, driven by lemon zest and fresh acidity. It's cool, clean, bright and fruity. Ready to drink now.
Earthy, woody, spicy berry aromas suggest briar patch and sandalwood. This is quite clampy and tannic, and thus the mouthfeel is rough. Gritty, herbal plum and berry flavors finish with a strong sense of oak and abrasive tannins. Drink through 2021.
Foamy in the Asti style, with metallic, earthy aromas of peach and lychee. Feels pretty good, with sweet, basic lychee and honeydew flavors. The finish is simply a carry over from the palate: it's sweet and melony in flavor.
Thick, dark concentration sets the tone, but elegance and harmony are achieved thanks to delicate mineral and balsam notes that add buoyancy and personality. This is a wine that speaks volumes about its Tuscan territory and you can almost taste that sun-drenched, chalky minerality sucked up through the vines' roots.

The blend is 76% Cabernet Sauvignon, 21% Merlot and 3% Petiit Verdot. It's all about the barrels right now, having spent 20 months in 50% new French oak. Toast, clove, cocoa and dark roast coffee flavors abound, but underneath the tart fruit carries some green notes. Decant for some time prior to consuming.
Long maturation in French oak lends a distinctly nutty, smoky tone to this brambly berried Merlot. While bold in body and a touch warm in alcohol, its ripe black-fruit flavors are sharpened by cranberry acidity and firm, penetrating tannins. A hint of cocoa powder lingers on the finish.
Part of Sadie's Old Vine Series, this is made with grapes sourced from a bush vine vineyard that dates back to 1974, of a variety that's not exactly common for the country. The resulting wine is pure and focused, offering hints of cassis, sauvage, leather and freshly tilled soil that accent the red berry, plum and cherry core. Fine, fleeting tannins lend an approachable structure to the palate, while earthy notes of black tea, bark and pepper linger on the finish. Drink now–2019.
The Cherryblock Cabs seem to share a common minty characteristic that's particularly noticeable in this vintage. There's also a decent amount of cassis, earth and tobacco, and the finish remains firmly tannic. Drink or hold.

This producer, based in the eastern edge of Saint-Emilion, has these vines in the flat plain that leads to the Dordogne river. The wine has richness that comes from the vintage while also having structure and power. The juicy acidity and blackberry fruits are still developing, so drink from 2019.

Too oaky and forward in tropical fruit flavors. Takes the popular style and exaggerates it. It will nonetheless appeal to lots of people.

Best to open this wine by 2015 or so.
Deep berry, cinnamon, briar and mint aromas. Firm, even backwards, it is trim and elegant, yet solid. Black fruit and bitter-chocolate flavors abound.

Smells good and rich, with waves of plum, blackberry, tar and smoke aromas, and the flavors are very similar. Drinks dry and tasty in the mouth, but loses a few points for a gritty tartness through the finish.
Here's a soft, seemingly sweet Zin. Part of its apparent sweetness is from the glycerine of high alcohol; part is from the extracted flavors of raspberry, milk chocolate and caramelized oak. It's almost a dessert wine, but is nonetheless a good example of its style, which will appeal to lots of people.
Austero is indeed an austere wine with thick intensity and loads of fragrant aromas of spice and ripe cherry. In the mouth, it proves an elegant and perhaps slightly thinner interpretation of Ripasso that would work well with pork or lamb chops.

A bit too brittle and tart to earn a higher score. Could be bottle shock, but it's hard to tell. Tasted in May, the wine showed mint-infused cherry flavors and turned sharp on the finish. Made from 100% Grenache.
Ripe and fragrant, with hints of peaches and cinnamon on the nose, followed by bold, fruit-driven flavors and more than a touch of sweetness.
This is the middle tier of Wölffer's Chardonnay offerings, squarely between the top-of-the-line Estate Selection and the entry-level La Ferme Martin label. The Reserve exhibits plenty of buttered-pear flavors, complemented by faint nutty aromas and some toasty oak notes that gain steam on the finish.
This Merlot is of everyday quality, with an easy-to-like silky texture and soft, almost sweet flavors of cherry, mocha and spice. It's not a bad value, and it should be widely available.
This is a fruity wine offering a strong mineral  element. It has apples and citrus notes that are cut with a tangy texture and a bite of acidity. Drink from 2016.
Put this into a blind flight of French rosé, and it will seem like one of the crowd. Crafted from 65% Grenache, 29% Syrah and 6% Cabernet Sauvignon, this is bone dry, dusty and detailed, showing a gorgeous onion-skin hue. The elegance and length are exceptional.
This is a measured Brunello that shows just enough aromatic intensity and texture to safely bet on its aging potential. At this young stage, the bouquet is still a bit shy with soft but balanced fruit tones set against savory spice and tobacco. In the mouth, the wine is bone dry and very fresh.
Initially closed, it slowly unfolds in the glass to reveal black cherry, espresso, plum, herbs, licorice, mocha and cake spices. Fine but brooding tannins still need time to unwind. Drink 2020–2040.
The inaugural vintage of this wine offers notes of caramel, herbs and raspberry. The flavors are full, chocolaty and sweet, backed by dry tannins.
Black olive dominates on the nose in this blend of 75% Syrah, 12.5% Grenache and 12.5% Mourvèdre, all from Kick Ranch. Lively red fruit is amplified by soft, medium-bodied tannins and a well-composed finish, with just enough earth and spice to go around.
This is has flavors of apple and red currant, with a dry, light touch. The acidity cuts through the palate, giving it an attractive freshness, with a touch of spice and a crisp finish.
Made from Norton, this Port-style wine is dark and brooding, with cooked-down blackberries, tar and sanguine tones on the nose and palate. Thick, tannic and astringent, this might be best alongside an equally rich fillet with blue cheese crumbles.
Crisp, off-dry and straightforward, this is an unexceptional Alsace white. There are some nice tones of petroleum, but they are undercut by a distracting scent of cooking grease. Unlikely to improve with age.
A little earthiness on the nose blows off to reveal a very concentrated and sweepingly apple-flavored palate which pitches generous, ripe fruit against welcome, tart freshness. This is open and and very joyous, fresh and utterly fruit-driven with a lasting, very moreish finish.
Aromas of barrel spice and vanilla lead the charge on this Tinto Fino that also contains 20% Cabernet Sauvignon. A tough, tannin-driven palate deals toasty flavors of black fruits, char and chocolate, which carry over to the finish. Call this an oak bomb, but at the very least the oak is of high quality and well integrated. Drink through 2025.
From granite soil at the Quinta do Vale Meão, this is a single parcel wine, hugely structured and very dense. It has weight and power, plus an impenetrable tannic character at this still-young stage. Very impressive and needing many years to age. Drink from 2018.
Mature and smooth, showing brown sugar and caramel sweetness alongside tobacco and soy. Drink now.
Rounded and ripe, with a fine streak of fresh acidity, the wine is bright, and lively, the final taut texture giving a delicious frisson.
At this stage of this smooth caramel- and vanilla-flavored wine, the wood element is prominent. Yet it has good weight, and you can sense the ripe, green fruits here. The structure is soft, round, just given crispness as the wine develops.
Tangerine and orange zest aromas are overcome by a peppery and stemmy quality. The palate feels underripe, offering tart citrus flavors and soapy floral tones.
Smells sort of gummy and candied, with aromas of red licorice stick, raisin and raspberry jam. The palate is sizable but comes with racy acidity, thus the flavors veer toward red fruits with an herbal accent. Burns a little on the finish due to sharp acids.
Significantly full and expansive in vanilla, lemon curd and toasty oak, the Durell Vineyard shows its power here, generous in ripe flavors and rich earth. Aged just under a year in a majority of new French oak, it's built to age through 2025 or more.
Merlot (57%) takes the lead on this lighter-colored wine that offers raspberries, cherries, herbs and woodspice. The fruit flavors are fresh and elegant, with lightly chalky tannins.
Tempranillo and Cabernet Franc aren't often thrown together, but here the marriage works. The nose offers herbal, leafy aromas from the CF, while berry fruit and oak carry the rest of the show. The palate is slightly crisp and racy, but its lightweight character is welcome. This is yet another well-made, interesting wine from one of our favorite obscure Spanish labels.
Aromas of spiced plum, purple flower, leather and truffle lead the nose on this informal wine. The solid palate offers dried cherry and a hint of licorice alongside grippy tannins that clench the finish.
This cooperative winery offers good quality at bargain prices. Here's a rich Amarone with lively chocolate, black cherry, vanilla and spice components. The sweet, penetrating bouquet is further enhanced by light shadings of steak sauce and cola.
This is a concentrated, balanced, sweetly juicy wine, benefiting from wood and ripe black fig and plum flavors. It has fine ripe tannins that support the freshly juicy fruits. Ready to drink, but will age over 2–3 years.
This is a beautiful lightly wood-aged wine. Made from arguably Portugal's greatest white grape, it is rich, smooth and balanced elegantly between toastiness and yellow fruits. The wine is still on the young side and will be better from spring 2018.
Prunotto's Barolo from the Bussia cru delivers ripe and jammy tones of strawberry preserves and blackberry pie that sit heavy over Nebbiolo's characteristically ethereal aromas. This wine will appeal to those who enjoy a bigger, bolder style of Barolo that finishes with rich, succulent fruit.
Cool, herbal black-fruit aromas come with olive and eucalyptus notes. The palate is full but grating, while flavors of herbal berry and plum are bit salty. On the finish, olive, brine and herbal berry flavors set this apart from most Ribera del Dueros. Drink through 2021.
From the mountains inland from Saint-Tropez, this finely textured and deliciously fruity wine from old vines is a blend of 50% Cinsault and 50% Mouvedre. In this well-balanced wine, fresh fruits are cut with acidity and given weight by a ripely spicy character. It's full in the mouth while remaining completely fresh.
Traditional, compact and elegant, this Chianti Superiore offers bright luminosity and delicate aromas of red berry and spice. This is not a beefy or intense wine, nor was it meant to be. It would taste best with pasta or pizza.
The aromas offer notes of pickling spices, cranberry and raspberry, with green herbs lurking in the background. The palate is fruit filled and quite flavorful for the vintage, showing finesse and polish.
Black cherry and blackberry take over on this Montepulciano-based wine from Central Italy. The juicy fruit carries over to the palate, along with prune and cinnamon-spice notes that add depth. Already friendly, hold for a couple of years to fully develop.

A vigorous, everyday sort of Pinot Noir, this is dry, tart and tannic, yet it has a nice silky texture and pleasant cherry, cola and baking spice flavors.
A ripe, peachy nose leads to a sprightly palate with just a touch of fizz. The palate is broader and earthier than the nose suggests but remains dry and fresh.

Smoke and mineral notes ride alongside blackberry and cassis to create an intense and deeply layered Barbera. This wine represents a modern school of winemaking in Asti and boasts rich, chewy texture on the close.
A blend of Fernão Pires and Moscatel, this is fresh, crisp and perfumed. It's an apéritif-like wine, with light acidity and a creamy, smooth texture.
This is a breakthrough vintage for Castello d'Albola and its team of winemakers who have crafted a truly beautiful and compelling wine rich with soft tones of chocolate fudge, almond paste, chewy cherry and long-lasting blueberry tones. The wine is plush and chewy in the mouth with big fruit flavors, yet it remains elegant and balanced at the same time.
Monção is the home of Portuguese Alvarinho. Ripe and opulent, this is full of yellow fruit, tangy citrus and intense acidity. After an extra year of aging, this finely balanced and impressive wine is ready to drink.
Oxidized, yeasty aromas are not fresh. On the palate, this is spritzy, but oxidation creates a yeasty, bready blanket on top of basic pear and papaya. It finishes flat.
Dry and tart in Carneros acidity, this has ripe, forward flavors of raspberry jam, cola and spice. It's pretty strong in mushroom and barnyard funkiness, which may turn some people off.
The nose shows an aroma of blackberry that is cooked in nature, with notes of smoke, charred meat and cracked pepper adding nuance. On the palate, red currant rides over mild tones of crushed stone and green peppercorn.
This bright Pinot Noir has aromas of rose, wet earth, tobacco and crushed stone. The finish is fresh and silky.
Briny, with a hint of salted caramel, this is a high-toned white wine, refreshing in lemon and pear notes, with a slight suggestion of orange peel that's entirely welcoming. Focused and crisp throughout, it remains vibrant amid a creaminess to the mouthfeel, finishing with the right balance of both.
Shows some real class and distinction, with velvety-smooth tannins and a nice touch of smoky cedar framing well-developed flavors of black cherry candy, red currants and spices. One of the best Merlots to come out of Paso Robles lately, at a fair price.
This opens with tart, tight leaf and beetroot flavors, which overlay quite soft, round and riper fruit. The integration of earthy tannins with the fruit is a little disjointed; what shows most clearly are the leafy, herbal plant flavors. There's plenty of stuffing here; perhaps this is one of those wines that will warrant a higher score with additional bottle age.
Sulphuric at first, with citrus and air freshener aromas. The palate has a certain roundness and fleshy quality, while the flavors are sweet, melony and a little oily. Some almond-skin bitterness rises up late, most likely reflecting the 25% Viognier in the blend.
A pure, lively scent of fresh apricots introduces this crisply defined Pinot Gris. The rich, full midpalate brings in further fruit notes of apple and pear, with a vivid and bracing acid foundation. Long and refreshing.
A flat, dull, tightly tannic Syrah that's meaty and ripe.
A tremendous rendition of the variety from an appellation not particularly associated with it, this wine is deftly etched with notes of black licorice, leather and earth. Explosive tannins underscore its core of juicy blackberry and smoke flavors, while the finish is sticky and somewhat feral.

A wine that brings together juicy fruit with firm, dark tannins. It has weight and some concentration, its acidity showing strongly through the blackberry fruit. For aging over 5–6 years.

Pungent aromas of ammonia and cat pee feature hints of gooseberry and grapefruit. Once past the nose, things settle down, with melon, fig and grapefruit flavors that finish a bit rough.

It shows great complexity and balance in a traditional dry style.
Overripe and unbalanced, with a Porty aroma and raisiny flavors that turn harsh and dry in the mouth.
This spicy version of the Muscat family is only found in Austria in the area around Lake Neusiedl. This wine shows great varietal character, with nutmeg flavors dominating; relatively dry to taste. The sweetness is there, but what is so delicious about this wine is its balance.
A big, thick, heavy Pinot Noir, showing the ripe flavors that a good Santa Lucia Highlands Pinot Noir usually has. Floods the mouth with raspberry and cherry pie filling, currants, red plums, cola and rhubarbs. Nothing shy about it. Good now with lamb chops or a nice steak, and should do interesting things over the next six years.
A nose of creamy toast and spice leads this round, smooth Chardonnay. Full and weighty on the palate with a pert, spicy spin, the wine is dependable and serious.

This hearty red is packed tight with superintense aromas of black fruit, leather, tobacco and roasted espresso bean. Bold, big and meaty, this is richly extracted and inky dark. Pair it with aged Pecorino cheese.
In this fresh and fruity wine, lively flavors of strawberry and watermelon are buoyed with adequate but not over-riding acidity. The finish is clean and lingering, inviting the next sip.
With floral aromas mixed with darker notes of asphalt, mineral, leather and berry fruit, this opens well. The palate is rubbery in feel but structured. Flavors of bold berry fruits, chocolate and herbs end chewy, warm and chocolaty. For a basic Carmenère-Cabernet blend, this is on the money.
Yellow grapefruit peel, crushed white peppercorns and fresh chervil paint a picture of a quintessential Grüner here: flavorsome but not heavy, concentrated but slender, easy to enjoy but never facile. More ripe pear fruit lurks temptingly at the core while that grapefruit theme is utterly convincing and captivating.
This is a powerful wood-aged wine. Spice and toast aromas give it a firm character that will need to soften. Its black plum and berry fruit is upfront, with a juicy element that will fill out. Drink from 2020.
This is an easy, no-fuss expression of Falanghina that opens with direct aromas of citrus and stone fruit and follows through to the palate with a tonic, refreshing feel. It would work with fried vegetable appetizers or light lunches.

Dry, even and light, this slightly sweet, straightforward wine offers cassis, blueberry and toast aromas and flavors. Soft and pleasant on the palate, it tightens up just a bit on the back end, showing mild tannins. A solid bar-pour and entry-level Cab, easy to enjoy.
Carmignano is one of the most overlooked appellations in Tuscany, but the work done here with Cabernet Sauvignon and other grapes is worth noting.

Owned by a religious community and produced by Domaine de Chevalier, this has weight, ripe blackberry fruit and a smooth surface. Under its dusty tannins, there is attractive acidity and a bright aftertaste.
Sometimes it seems the Portuguese winemakers make random blends. This 50-50 blend of Pinot Noir and Touriga Nacional is a case in point. Yet, the first grape softens the second to make a wine that is easy, ripe and ready to drink. The finish, with its touches of toast, is well balanced by acidity. So the random works. Drink from 2018.
This is an elegant wine, with balanced fruit and tannins that make for a soft texture. It is rich and laced with fresh, raspberry-like acidity. It can age for another year, but it is also ready to drink.
Shy when first opened, this wine reveals grapefruit and pineapple scents with a little air. The medium-bodied palate has a tangy quality, offering juicy peach and citrus flavors, accompanied by fresh acidity.
Cheesy smelling oak and slightly overripe fruit aromas are a little less than spotless on the nose. In the mouth, this is raw and saucy in feel, with biting tannins. Sauvage berry flavors are gamy, while this is drying, scratchy and rugged on the finish. Drink through 2022.
A mix of exotic fruits and herbaceous flavors adds both freshness and richness. A mineral texture gives a bite to the wine, allowing it to bring out lemon and grapefruit tastes. Drink at the end of 2014.

Hints of potpourri and spice waft over aromas of ripe blackberries and bramble wood on this punchy, concentrated Cabernet Franc. Aged four years in French oak, it has a nuanced complexity that shows itself in shades of earth, toast and smoke that accent its tart red-fruit flavors. Finishes long with a hint of herbaceous green.
This wine is lighter in color, with aromas of sawdust, cherry and barnyard. The style is quite faint, with spice flavors on the finish.
Not much going on fruit-wise in this lean, but clean, brisk wine. Oak stars, with charry caramel and vanilla overpowering the modest peach and apricot flavors.
Longboard shies away from overt fruit in favor of earthier tobacco flavors in this dry, complex and tannic young Pinot Noir. That doesn't mean you won't find plenty of raspberries and cherries. The wine is dry, delicately structured and frankly delicious, making it Longboard's best Pinot Noir ever. Drink now–2019 as it gradually sheds fruit.
Zaca Mesa has been exploring the outer limits of Roussanne for years, and the 2003 was not a very good wine. This is far better. Dry, medium-bodied and fruity, with crisp acidity framing citrus, peach, apricot and buttercream flavors, it's an intriguing alternative to Chardonnay.

This yeasty funky Chardonnay is on its last legs. The mouthfeel is mealy and the flavors are dull, yeasty, generic and lightly oxidized on the finish.
Here's a cheerful sparkler that offers subdued aromas of yellow flower with a whiff of banana peel. Pineapple and pear flavors greet the palate along with steely bubbles. This is simple but well-made and makes a fun apéritif.
This brilliantly luminous white delivers aromas of pear, kiwi, citrus, apple, white rock and subtle background notes of pineapple and exotic fruit that add dimension and depth. Immediate and straightforward, it leaves the palate tingly-fresh.

Aromas of butterscotch, apricot preserves and vanilla caramel lead to flavors of quince preserves and apricot tart. Round in the mouth, it shows excellent structure and delights with refreshing acidity on the finish.
Dark and powerful, this is a complex and concentrated wood-aged wine. It's a blend of two local Gaillac grapes, Duras and Braucol, which gives richness, structure and a dense, herbal character. This wine, with its long term future, is still young, showing as much tannin as fruit, so don't drink before 2016.
Aromas of pear, apricot and stemmy herbs lead to full-feeling pear and stone -ruit flavors that pull up short on the back nine, seeming a bit underripe.

Is this the best Cabernet that Viu Manent has ever bottled? We think it very well might be; the wine is midnight madness, meaning it's dark as night and richly draped with blackberry, cassis, black plum and overall lushness. It's a hulk of a wine, with jammy fruit, fine tannic structure and handsome shadings. Drinkable now and probably better over the next two or three years.
There's a velvety silkiness to this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon as well as a lushness to the palate that will please aficionados of both Cabernet and Pinot Noir. Refined tannins stand out in subtle ways, as do high-toned cassis and blackberry. Though the wine displays a richness of oak and chocolate, the minerality truly shines here. This will cellar well through 2025.
Aromas of overripe black fruit, leafy forest floor and horse sweat lead the nose. The palate is rather muddled, offering steeped plum, anisette and a leathery note alongside bracing tannins.
This widely found local grape has produced a crisp, wine full complex berry and black fruits that are balanced with tannins. Richly structured, the wine is held together by the tannins and by the bright acidity typical of the grape. Drink now.

Leather, charred oak and mineral carry the nose, which also offers some generic black-fruit aromas. The palate is firm and tannic, thus the early session of cassis and blackberry is preferable to the tail-end notes of buttery oak, tannin and burnt coffee.
Here is a great achievement for lovers of Montepulciano d'Abruzzo.

On the dry side, with tannins and bitter chocolate. The wine is full and ripe, quite dense in character, some sweetness as well as acidity.
Soft, medium sweet wine with hints of honey, light apricot and acidity. This is a wine for chicken dishes or as an apéritif.

Gritty, heavily roasted aromas of peanuts and herbal berry fruits lead to a scratchy, tannic palate. This tastes of burnt oak, raw plum and currant, while the finish tastes briny and harsh. The 2012 version of this wine was much better. This is rough from front to back.
More traditional in style than some of the other Castello d'Alba wines, this shows dense tannins, a dark, dry character, spice, pepper and concentrated fruit. This is going to be firm and dry, worth aging.
Tastes rich and forward, with cherry pie, blueberry and sandalwood flavors. The color is dark, and the wine is a little too soft, as well as hot in alcohol. Drink up.

A 50-50 blend of Merlot and Malbec, this is the most expensive wine the chateau has ever produced, a commemoration of their 25th anniversary. It commands attention for dryness and complexity.

This is a very important release from the winery, one worthy of follow up.
There's a purity and wholesome quality to this lovely Syrah. It's dry and soft as velvet, with rich flavors of blackberries, mocha, leather, violets, black pepper and sandalwood. Best now and for a year or two.
Tropical with notes of gingerbread and vanilla, this wine tastes full bodied despite its medium level of alcohol. It offers a reduced note on the finish, anchored otherwise in sweet toffee.
This wine has lots to recommend, from its soft, slightly spicy introduction, to big berry and vanilla flavor follow through. But most memorable is its beautiful perfume, encompassing all those singular elements. Give it some time in bottle to show through.

Aromas include oak extract, yellow flower, citrus zest and Mediterranean herb. The palate offers butterscotch and vanilla but not much fruit richness or freshness.

It is not easy to describe one of the majestic wines of France. This 2007 is still a wine in the making.

It is an extraordinary wine, with freshness, sweetness, dryness and acidity all just about perfectly balanced. Give it at least seven years.
Licorice, fennel and tropical guava provide a flourish of savory and ripe around a fleshy, rounded and smooth overlay unimpeded by oak, the wine aged in both stainless steel and neutral oak barrels.

The Château Grenouilles vineyard, wholly owned by members of the La Chablisienne cooperative, is in the upper part of Grenouilles Grand Cru. As such, this is major Chablis, a wine that needs maybe 10 years' aging. But already, you can discern the richness of this wine, its powerful yellow fruits, honey and toast, dense in texture as well as vivid with acidity.
Aromas recall nail polish remover, overripe fruit, oak vanilla and coffee. The palate offers black cherry mingled with vanilla, chocolate and sweet oak. However it lacks intensity and persistence and doesn't have an age-worthy structure. It closes on a drying, tannic note before trailing off.
Heat marks this wine. It smells and tastes peppery, along with deeply extracted flavors of currants, licorice, violets and cedar. Bone dry and pretty hard in tannins, with the oak showing, it's a bit austere and clumsy now. Needs time, and could be quite good after 2011.
Blackberry and other fruits are presented clearly on the nose, while the rubbery, bouncy palate seems properly tight and balanced. Sweet, stretched-out flavors of black plum and berry are warm and youthful. Good for basic drinking.
Shows the balance of a fine Bien Nacido Pinot Noir, and also the density and spiciness of the Santa Maria Valley. Strikes a middle zone between light elegance and heavy full-bodiedness, with rich flavors of black cherry, Dr. Pepper, clove and black pepper flavors. Lovely now, and it should develop bottle complexity through 2016.
This blend of Carmenère, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah is stellar given that 2011 was a cool year. Earthy aromas of wet clay, violet, blackberry and fresh herbs set up a balanced, ripe palate with flavors of plum, berry, mocha and vanilla. On the finish, tobacco, herbs, spice and vanilla flavors are textbook for the Alto Maipo, where this wine comes from. Drink through 2018.
Earthy and dark fruit-driven, this is a richly rewarding, fruity wine, ripe in blackberry, clove and cocoa. From an estate vineyard named for Benovia proprietor's two mothers, Martha and Eleanor, it offers the appellation's classic elements of savory clove and cola.
Sizable tannin, weight and oak suggest cellaring this wine through 2019. The time will be well spent developing this wine's generously robust and vibrant swirls of wild strawberry, black cherry and baking spices. Bright acidity and floral aromas of violet and rose complete the lovely package.
This smooth ripe wine is ready to drink. Its black fruits and soft tannins go well with the juicy flavors and fine acidity. Generous and with a warm, rich character.
This wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Cabernet Franc, Carménère, Merlot and Petit Verdot, coming from a block designed by the late Master of Wine David Lake.

Dense and extracted, this offers aromas of black cherry, ground pepper, pine sap and dried herb. The palate delivers blackberry syrup, dried cherry, mocha and clove alongside grainy tannins. Drink through 2019.
Coda di Volpe offers resiny aromas of pine syrup and butterscotch backed by ripe melon and pear. The wine is thick and sticky and would probably pair best with fish soup or crab cakes.

The blend is 60-40 Grillo and Viognier and the wine offers aromatic components of both varieties. The first imparts green notes of kiwi and cut grass and the second offers sweet floral fragrances.

This wine is rich and spicy. At this stage, with its muted fruit, it is all potential, but one can sense the ripeness and generous texture that will make it excellent once it matures. Give this powerful wine until 2023.
Throw some steaks on the barbie, or shrimp wrapped in bacon, or almost anything grillable, and then enjoy it with this soft, lush wine. Sure, it's high in alcohol, almost Porty, but that's the price of hitting the sweet spot of fruit and chocolate.
Siduri's basic Russian River bottling is very ripe in fruit, heavy in texture and soft, with a cherry, coffee and chocolate syrup flavor. It's as tasty as a candy. Drink now.

Shows a rich blend of citrus and stone fruits on the nose and on the palate, easily combining grapefruit, passion fruit and nectarines into a cohesive package. Finishes long, with tangy, lip-smacking acids that beg you to give this wine some time in the cellar. It's tasty now, but should be better in 2005.

A good, rich Cabernet for drinking now and over the short term. It's dry and full-bodied, and if it's a little heavy, the blackberry, currant, butter and cedar flavors are delicious.
Taut, minerally and delicious, this could age but is refreshing and zingy now. It has fine depth of flavor—its herbal and grapefruit flavors are right up front.
This combination of Monastrell and Cabernet Sauvignon is so heavily oaked that it smells almost entirely of clove. A grabby palate delivers flavors of blueberry, blackberry and clove in front of a finish that's woody and tannic. Time will tell if the oak will subside; at this moment it's dominant.

Made entirely from Nero d'Avola, this juicy red opens with ripe black-skinned berry and Mediterranean scrub aromas. Fine-grained tannins underscore its blackberry jam, sage and vanilla flavors. Enjoy through 2020.

A simple, easy wine to drink, crisp and slightly sweet in orange, lime, peach and pear flavors.
86–88. Barrel sample. On the dry, extracted side, this is a wine with some firm tannins and solid structure. The aftertaste is dark, mineral and austere.
Fresh and broad aromas of strawberry syrup meet with eucalyptus oil and wild mint on the clean if simple nose of this bottling. It grows more tart on the sip, with roasted red plum, cranberry and pomegranate, but the fascinating parts are the curious hints of cannabis and hops, which give herbal depth to the fruit.
Off-dry, it's simple and clean, with not much flavor beyond basic light melon. It can best serve as a mixer for cocktails or punch.

This is the best barrel blend from the vintage, utilizing 40% Clos Pepe, 40% Bentrock, 10% Zotovich and 10% Kessler-Haak vineyards.

The palate is delicate in flavor but strong on grippy texture, with sliced apple, tangy kumquat and grapefruit pith.
This lovely Cabernet shows well-defined black currant, olive and spice flavors, and has a good balance of acidity and grippy tannins. It's rich, dry and complex. The oak is pronounced, but perfectly balanced with the fruit. Really displays class and pedigree.

Earthy notes of porcini mushroom and black olive blend with balsamic plum and cherry aromas. This is a touch heavy and syrupy in feel, and thus creamy flavors of chocolate, plum and berry are not surprising. On the finish, this remains creamy and ripe.
Mount Eden makes their estate Cab the old-fashioned way: to age. The '05 is quite tannic and shut down right now, with a hard astringency, especially on the finish. However, it's rich in black currants, mocha and cedar, and is a natural for many years in the cellar. The score could rise considerably after 2011.
Notes of peach pit, wet stone, tomato leaf and struck match are tied together by a medium body and prickly acidity, finishing with melon rind and more green leafy flavors.
Youthful and bright, this shows the lean, bright side of the Famiglia Zingarelli line. You can really taste those Sangiovese characteristics thanks to lively tones of wild berry, raspberry, blue flower, wild mushroom and subtle spice. That zesty acidity makes the wine perfect for cheesy pasta or lasagna.
Clean, crisply defined fruit tastes like ripe strawberries, with side notes of melon and orange peel. Good acidity, and the winemaker has let the fruit steal the show—if there are new barrels involved, they are certainly in the background. Medium-bodied, nicely balanced and built for cellaring over the next 6–8 years.
Very ripe yellow fruits make this a generous, dense, rich wine. A light touch of wood and acidity balance the super-rich character of the wine. Maybe it's all too much—too opulent—but then again, it is delicious.
Adequate but disappointing; the Moore's Creek wines usually perform better than this. Offers some barnyard on the nose, and dilute plum and tea flavors on the palate. Finishes short. Imported by Pasternak Wine Imports.
Violet, crushed herb and mint aromas start this Agiorgitiko. On the palate, coca, vanilla, red berry and a savory spin give it depth. Fresh and friendly but substantive, this wine can age.
If you open this bottle before late 2009, you'll find a tightly wound wine marked by acidity and tannins. In other words, not showing its best. Inside the structure is remarkably ripe fruit, along the lines of cherries, currants, pomegranates and cola. It's a big, exuberant wine, but it does need time, and has the balance to achieve it.
Raisin and prune aromas are components of the nose on this ripe Ribera del Duero that offers additional notes of fig and chocolate. A fleshy, thick palate deals earthy black-fruit, prune and spicy flavors prior to a chunky, chewy finish. Drink through 2024.
How this producer squeezes 15.6% alcohol levels out of its Cabernet is a fair question. Despite the implied concentration, this hard and steely wine shows tight cassis fruit wrapped in smoky, coffee, barrel flavors.

Drink 2018–2030.
While Alicante Bouschet is probably more at home in the Alentejo, this wine from the coastal Lisboa region still has much of the dark color, solid, dry tannins and intensely juicy wild-berry fruits. It is ready to drink.
Structured, ripe and with great fruit, this is a bold warm wine. It has plenty of rich berry fruits, ripe tannins and layers of spice and toast. With its concentration, this is going to be a rich wine. Drink from 2022.
Owner Xavier Chassagnoux bought this estate in 1978, producing this as the top wine of the property. It shows the richness and fruitiness of the vintage, a ripe wine with black-plum fruit and touches of wood aging as well as crisp acidity at the end. Drink from 2018.
Stainless-steel fermentation and picking the grapes at a relatively low brix (24.2) yields a crisp wine with lime skin, grapefruit and hints of quinine. The opening flavors extend into a mid-palate cut with tart acids and adding white peach, melon and nectarine to the fruit. It finishes bone dry, like a twist of lemon.
This Tuscan Sangiovese opens with flavors of cherry, blackberry and bold modern spice. It delivers bright acidity, balance and crispness, with a food-friendly personality.
Tastes young, sharp in acids and jammy sweet right now, with upfront cherry, raspberry and blackberry flavors. But after all, it is a California Barbera, and these puppies age forever. Give it some time, but don't expect it ever to become sophisticated.
Ripe black plum, leather, chocolate and allspice emerge on this big, brooding wine. The densely concentrated palate offers raisin, blackberry extract, licorice, ground pepper and tobacco alongside ripe, velvety tannins and the warmth of alcohol. It closes on a licorice note. Drink through 2022.
The small appellation of Quincy, near Sancerre, produces soft, ripe Sauvignon Blanc. This has ripe acidity, with flavors of baked apple and pear and a fine citrus streak.
Polished and supple yet young and even immature, this wine flatters now for its rich blackberry, cherry, meat and oak flavors. It's very dry, with sturdy, dusty tannins and a bite of acidity on the finish. Dramatic now for its overall balance, and best with rich fare. Drink now through 2005.

This Trebbiano is off gold in color and opens with ripe aromas of apricot and candied fruit. The wine shows some heaviness in the mouth with afternotes of fruit and almond.
Beautifully balanced and racy, this is packed with spice and juicy fruit flavors. It layers currants and fresh fruits with a mature hint of toast. This finishes with a fine swathe of delicious fruit.
Planted in 2006 to heirloom clones, most of them Pommard, this is a concentrated, tannic wine that needs time in bottle to develop. For now, expect rose and raspberry, with a depth of black cherry compote—flavors that are immediately inviting and richly layered. Yet, it will tell more of its story down the road. Allow it to open now or cellar through 2029.
Here's a modern blend of Aglianico, Merlot and Syrah with dense aromas of black fruit, lead, tar and wild mushroom. The wine definitely has a wild, rustic or untamed nature and closes with bold flavors of jammy fruit.
A wine that shows rich blackberry fruits, already rounded and soft. It has a tannic structure that is embedded in the fruit, along with spice, toast and a firm finish. An ageworthy wine.
87-89 Barrel sample. This is on the juicy side, with sweet fruits, quite light textured. Smooth and juicy.
An easy and approachable quaff with standard notes of cassis and black plum throughout. A touch of spice and licorice keeps things interesting and remain present through the medium-length close.
I like this Merlot for its full-bodied richness and depth of flavor. It's so much better than the '02. With 15% Cabernet, it's almost a full point higher in alcohol than the winery's Bliss Merlot, and it shows in the opulent, fat blackberry, blueberry and cassis flavors.
This rich, smoky wine has broad tannins and a soft texture. It's full in the mouth with sweet red fruits and gentle tannins. Already attractive, it's likely to develop quickly with its warm character. Drink from 2016.
Heavy oak flavors and a massive mouthfeel make this wine a little intimidating for the uninitiated, but those who enjoy spicy oak flavors like vanilla and nutmeg—as well as the smoky overtones that come from toasted oak—will enjoy it. Thick layers of drying tannins almost overwhelm the palate, but then the ripe fruit kicks back in to keep it controlled.
Full-bodied and brisk, with an edgy mouthfeel framing flavors of raspberries, cherries, brioche and yeast. Drink now.
This is all Cabernet, aged in American oak, and it delivers dark and tannic flavors suggesting purple plum and black cherry. Tannins are rugged and the oak seems to have a fairly high level of toast, which translates into flavors of coffee grounds and ash.
Saffron and honey notes are earthy and dusty in profile, but add striking complexity to a palate that's concentrated with peach and orange flavors. Strong acidity cuts through layers of luscious honey and fruit, before finishing on a pleasantly floral note.
A direct and appealing wine with notes of freshly cut grass and citrus. It's medium bodied and off-dry (15 g/L residual sugar) with sweet fruit flavors that come off as a bit diluted.
Toast, vanilla and spice on the nose start this elegantly constructed white from, Attica. The wine's lemon and lime flavors are layered with cedar and vanilla notes. An appealing pour with more years to age.

A light, modern, just off-dry and fruity wine, freshened by bright lime and apricots, with a tang of orange zest. This is crisp, very clean, a good apéritif drink.
Matchstick, mushroom and licorice nib aromas add character to this fading but textured wine that struggles to offer peach and nectarine flavors. Expect additional softness with each passing month, and along the way you should only hope to salvage some citrus, white chocolate and melon notes.
This 50/50 Barbera/Sangiovese blend is described by the winemaker as “lean and rustic.” Despite that unpromising description, it's a pleasant quaffing wine, with pie cherry fruit moving quickly into butterscotch, around slightly bitter tannins.
Smells caramelly and Porty, and tastes dry and astringent. A bitter Cab with little to recommend it.
This blend of 37% Cabernet Sauvignon, 37% Shiraz and 26% Merlot boasts assertive aromas of cassis, black plum and licorice root. The medium-weight palate offers similarly concentrated fruit flavors, with a slightly chewy texture and a long, spicy finish.
Suave and earthy juniper, red rose petal and dried-herb tones meet with concentrated red cherries and exotic Indian spice on the nose of this nicely bottle-aged wine.

A different breed of blended wine, with earthy aromas of dried cheese, leather, dill and vanilla. The palate is tight and mildly tannic, with sweet cola, roasted berry and earthy tobacco flavors. Not your normal bulky, dark wine; it's complex and based on 85% Garnacha and Carignan.
What a track record Byron has achieved with this single-vineyard wine, despite the hassles of ownership change. The '03 continues the tradition. It's rich and complex in cola, black cherry, coffee, cocoa and cinnamon spice flavors, with the silky elegance you want in a Pinot Noir. Drink now.
A blend of Carricante and Catarratto from vineyards plated 600 meters above sea level on the slopes of Mount Etna, Quota 600 is among Sicily's best white wines. Compact, tonic and streamlined, it does a beautiful job of presenting delicate floral and peach fruit aromas against an austere backdrop of crushed stone and talcum powder.
Very rich, ripe and packed with new-wood flavors, this is somewhat flashy, but it's still delicious to drink. Sit back and enjoy.
High-toned aromas of beeswax and ginger carry onto the medium-full, lissome palate, which picks up notes of glazed pear and flower.
Made by Paso Robles-based Ranchero from old vine Carignan grown in Mendocino's Redwood Valley, this still-young rendition of this rough and tumble Old World grape is densely rich and textured with aromas of blackberry and blueberry, clove and tobacco, with a nice kick on the finish. Winemaker/owner Amy Butler also makes the Edward Sellers wines from Paso Robles.
Tastes soft and thick and simple, with superripe berry flavors veering into sweetened espresso. This wine is going nowhere, so drink up now.
Juniper and onion aromas are not inviting, and there's little fruit to back them up. The mouthfeel is oily, while flavors of briny citrus lead to a pickled-tasting finish. Tasted twice, with consistent results.
A substantial addition of 18% Merlot and smaller touch of 2% Cabernet Franc contribute to the heartiness and warmth of this wine that is tight in tobacco and graphite, with a smattering of coconut. Bittersweet chocolate, clove and dried herb contribute aroma and full-bodied flavor.
This classic Napa Cabernet is juicy in explosive black cherry and cassis flavors that pair with firm, integrated tannin and an elegant structure. The oak is restrained, contributing complementary baking-spice accents. Long and sublime on the finish. Best from 2024–2040.
On the money right from the start, where deep aromas of black fruits, minerality and fresh herbs mingle nicely. The palate is creamy and smooth, with rich, almost syrupy berry, cream, coffee and toffee flavors. Oaked up but not “oaky,” with caramel and chocolate on the smooth finish. Drink now through 2015.
With exceptional dryness, acidic crispness and minerality, this Chardonnay can be described as Chablis-style. The structure is certainly noble, and nobody would ever accuse it of being a fruit bomb despite the rich pineapple tart and lemon drop flavors. Hard to predict its future, but probably best over the next four years.
A wine that is deliciously perfumed from the 25% Cabernet Franc in the blend. The wine has very ripe black fruits, with contrasting intense acidity, toast and dark chocolate. It's powerful and concentrated, with good aging potential.
With cherry, green herb and mint flavors, this Cab Franc is elegantly structured, but lacks the richness you want in a California Bordeaux-style wine.
This is a very pretty Pinot Noir color, scented with raspberries and spiced up with a lightly peppery finish.
This smells murky and soupy, with a palate that feels angular and high in acidity. It tastes mulchy and tart, delivering a barbecue note on the finish.

Citrus pith, peach pit and other largely neutral aromas define the nose. The palate is soft and a touch flat, with ripe, nonsheering peach and citrus flavors. Midlevel Chilean SB in every way, shape and form. Imported by Racke USA.
The restrained nose just gives a glimpse of lemon freshness. Lemon notes intensify on the palate, where they attain a lovely textural feel of pith and zest. A slender wine, it still carries a hint of yeast on the midpalate, but is subtle, clean, slender and fine. The finish is dry and refreshing.
A forward and dark-fruit nose with peppery accents and a dill-menthol note open this pleasing Shiraz. Medium and dark-berry flavors with leather and herb notes play into a pleasing dry and full finish, with even tannins. Continues to open in the glass, revealing more depth and nuance than first evidenced. Best Buy.
A fresh, strawberry-flavored wine, with good red berry and red apple-skin textures. The acidity is initially prominent, but then there is also a burst of candy, leaving softness.
Lively and vibrant, bright scents of apple and fresh orange supremes quickly fade on the light-weight palate and on the clean but short finish.

Composed cherry, cassis, tobacco and oak aromas are elegant and on the spot. This is alert on the palate, with bold acidity and moderate tannins. Lightly herbal plum and cherry aromas are earthy and leafy but not green. A rugged-feeling herbal finish suggests Cabernet Franc, but this is 100% Cab Sauvignon.
After an opening that's varietally intense, meaning there's a lot of green herbs, olive and carob on the nose, things turn more fruity and fresh. The feel is racy, a bit high in acidity and superficial, with herbal blackberry, olive and chocolate flavors. Young and lively.
Shows Pinot's elegance and silkiness, with raspberry and rhubarb pie flavors. The texture is light, and there's a lot of mouthwatering acidity. The chief criticism is a lack of concentration. Drink up.

Though the blend includes small portions of other grapes—9% Syrah, 3% Merlot and 5% Cabernet Franc—this really champions the essential character of great Washington Cabernet. Its core fruit is supple and compact cassis and black cherry, with a spicy top note that resonates well into the finish. Concentrated and beautifully proportioned, with black olive and just a hint of leaf in the finish.
Perhaps it is this wine's elevated proportion of Carignan (15%) that gives it such a lovely and distinctive perfume, incorporating hints of ground pepper, cinnamon or clove, and ripe cherries.

Pian delle Vigne's 2004 Brunello is worlds apart from the scorching hot 2003 vintage—so different, in fact, the wine seems utterly reborn. You can smell those hallmark Sangiovese aromas: cherry, blue flower and wet earth, and taste the variety's elegant acidity.
Only the faint smell of grass emerges from this wine, but the palate is another story, with fresh squeezed lime and brisk nectarine flavors. The mouthfeel starts rich and then zips up tight with nice acidity. This vibrant wine needs food that's both rich and exotic, so try Chinese or Indonesian.

Warmed croissant yeastiness matches up with sea salt and lemon butter on the nose of this bottling from the pioneering Santa Barbara Winery. The salinity carries on the palate, with apple pie and butterscotch presenting a nicely oaked but not overdone palate.
Following on from the great 2002 vintage of this wine, the 2004 is equally memorable. It is a magnificent wine, structured and beautifully balanced between the ripe white fruits and the tight texture that will allow it to age many years. While drinkable now, it is still young at 11 years, still with great potential. Drink now, until 2024, and probably beyond.

The mouthfeel is plush and filling, with generous yet structured tannins and ample acidity that frame the rich dark fruits. Final flavors of cassis and char linger long on the finish.
Perhaps it's because of the stem inclusion, but this wine is amazingly floral and spicy on the nose. On the palate, it's just a little creamy in texture, with savory elements that balance raspberry underpinnings. Tannins are supple, making it deceptively easy to drink now, although it should age well through at least 2016. The blend is 35% Mourvèdre, 35% Grenache and 30% Syrah.
This astonishingly fruity wine is ripe with tropical flavors and a rich, juicy character. The wine is full bodied showing apricot fruits along with a textured character. The wine could age, so drink from 2015.
Aromas of coffee, chocolate and fresh herbs are followed by grainy dark fruit flavors. The tannins need some time to stretch their legs.
Crisp and stylish, this bright and lightly fruity wine is full in the mouth with soft apple and citrus flavors. Its acidity and fruitiness are still coming forward, so drink from 2016.
This blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 21% Merlot, 19% Cab Franc and 10% Petit Verdot is sourced from the Hedges, Stillwater, and Conner Lee vineyards. At first soft and smooth, it morphs into a textural wine with a mouthful of purple and black fruits—from blackberry on through cassis. Streaks of smoke, graphite and espresso highlight the finish.
This powerful blend of 23% Malbec, 20% Carmenere, 20% Cabernet Franc, 16% Cabernet Sauvignon, 14% Merlot and 7% Petite Verdot delivers layered aromas of olallieberry, grape candy, sage, anise and lava rocks. Purple fruits dominate the palate, with complexity provided by creosote and violets, along with ample tannins and acidity.
Warm and fruity, this has the right amount of wood and sweetly ripe blackberry flavor. It is certainly structured, but the generous texture balances it, making it likely to age into a full, ripe character. Drink in 4–5 years.
The wood shows strongly on this still young wine. It has a rich, generous feel, packed with peach and pineapple fruits as well as a fine texture. Wait to drink this fine food wine until 2015.
A different aromatic profile here, with bread dough and wet grass scents dominating the nose. It's well structured, with good flowery intensity in the mouth and a weighty, medium-to-long finish. Drink now.
Basic, fundamental Zin, with its wild berry, tobacco and white pepper flavors, brawny tannins and full-bodied texture. A bit rustic. Enjoy with burgers or spaghetti.
Exquisitely fragrant notes of ripe, aromatic apples rise from the glass: tart, fruity and fresh in equal measure. The palate shows both evolved autolysis by way of soy-spiced breadiness and even more fruit in the way of bruised, tart apple notes of great purity. The finish is long and full of flavor, complex, nuanced and resolutely dry.
Wood aromas provide a toasty character that dominates the fruit. It will take time for the apple and pear fruit flavors to show. Drink from 2020.
A black currant-dominated wine, with a stalky, herbal series of flavors along with a positive juicy, fruit-forward character. The tannins are firmly dry with some smoky spice at the end.
This is an interesting wine for drinking now as an alternative to a dry, full-bodied red, such as Merlot or Cabernet. It's spicy and ripe in red currant, licorice, smoked meat, violet and sandalwood flavors that are rich and complex.
91-93. Barrel sample. This wine has density, with very dry, massive tannins. This is a wine for long-term aging; it has a solid texture, with its fruit well buried.
Mint and heat on the nose give way to baked dark-fruit aromas and earth. The palate is warm, structured and solid, with solid raspberry and plum flavors. Slightly creamy and candied on the finish, with coconut from the barrel and a final blast of heat. Not a wine for aging; drink now with food.
Fiesta is the lightest, most fruit forward of the four different Tempranillos from Abacela. In a great year such as this, it's also substantial and authoritative, with deeply driven flavors of red and blueberry fruit, a whiff of oak and slightly grainy tannins. This wine clearly over-delivers for the price.
This is a 100% varietal wine sourced from the coveted Oakville Ranch Vineyard on the eastern edge of the appellation. Cedar, herb, meat and soy mingle around a full-bodied weight softened by the wine's classic edge, length and breadth of black fruit and vanilla oak. Drink now through 2022.
Delicately scented, this opens with aromas of white spring flower, orchard fruit and a whiff of Mediterranean herb. On the creamy palate, an energizing mineral vein underscores golden apple, juicy white and peach and nectarine.
A gold color indicates maturation, while loud, tropical fruit aromas fold in lychee, citrus blossom and sweat. The palate is electric due to citric acidity, while flavors of orange, tangerine, lemon-lime and grapefruit finish with a chalky feel.
Spicy and tannic, this inexpensive Pinot from Cherry Hill opens with earthy fruit and leaf flavors—tomato and herb dominate, with just a suggestion of berry. There isn't much in the way of ripeness here, to either fruit or tannins.
This sultry wine is sourced from the producer's Trenton Road vineyard, cooler than where the winery itself sits in Chalk Hill. Planted to six clones, it provides this bottling with a taste of blueberry and raspberry integrated around soft, juicy tannins and a brightness of acidity.
This wine surprises in its sanguine nature, dusted in currant and cranberry, with a dustiness to the firm, but not overbearing tannins. Structured and light-bodied in an elegant way, it remains lively in the glass.
93-95 Barrel sample. Rich, hugely ripe, intense fruit flavors, with layers of spice and acidity, but also full-bodied, well-integrated fruit. As always, Haut-Brion's white is at the top.
Young and purple, with strong aromas of cassis, dark chocolate and smoky vanilla. It's surprisingly rich and dense; a layered wine with lots of interesting flavors. It's also quite tannic, and will be better if aged for a few years. Contains 20% Syrah. Best Buy.
A huge Pinot Noir, superripe and exotic in raspberry and cherry jam, persimmon, cola, cinnamon, clove and sandalwood flavors. Defines the Sonoma Coast, with a crisp spine of acidity providing bright structure. Bold now, all fruit and oak, but has the balance to develop bottle nuance through 2015, at the very least.
Grown on hills overlooking the Mediterranean, this wine sings of sunshine and warm days. It is fruity, fatter than in some previous vintages although still with good acidity and a lively aftertaste.
At four-plus years of age, this single-vineyard Syrah still has babyfat flavors of blackberry jam, cassis, red currants, licorice, cola, Asian spice and smoky oak that are fresh and vibrant. It's lovely now, with a rich texture of finely-ground tannins, but should develop additional complexity with another five years in the cellar.
Rewards for its rich Champagne personality and California expression of fruity flavor. Although the texture could be a bit smoother, the wine has a fine mousse, with complex, subtle flavors of strawberries, limes, vanilla, yeasty dough and wood smoke.
Pale in color, this 100% Grenache has arresting, complex aromas of candied strawberries, pomegranate, herbs, plum and orange peel. The red fruit and savory flavors are sweet and generous, showing an exquisite sense of purity and richness. It's a knee-buckler but all about delicacy and restraint.
This attractive blend of 53% Sémillon and 47% Riesling offers a bouquet of petrol and apricot, while the palate is lively, with honeyed flavors of caramel, vanilla and apricot. It's a bit sticky on the finish, but overall this is an eye-opener. Drink now–2015.
Vanillan oak notes dominate on this Pinot Noir, originating from Nelson, on the northwest of New Zealand's South Island. Red berry, licorice, and savory olive characters follow, along with chunky tannins and lashings of acidity. Stylistically this is a broody, oaky, powerful expression of Pinot and one that will need food or a few years in bottle for the oak to mellow out. Drink now–2022.
Made with the native Cortese grape of northern Italy, this luminous sparkling wine opens with toasted notes of roasted almond, white pepper and mature peach or apricot. Firm, steely effervescence gives the wine a sharp, determined personality.
A wonderful Gewürz. You never know what to expect from this varietal, but in this case the wine is basically dry, and freshly crisp in acidity. The flavors are complex, ranging from oranges, pineapples and honeysuckle to star anise, toffee and the famous spices of Gewürztraminer. There's also a rich, creamy texture.
Palliser's wines seem to be improving across the range over recent vintages, with this being their best Sauvignon Blanc yet. A smoky, slightly fumé character marks the nose, then ripe peaches and nectarines wash across the palate, with just enough grassiness to impart varietal character. Plump and round, it's soft and approachable without being sloppy, ending on a note of ripe tangerines. Drink now.
This dry, Syrah-based Rhône-style blend feels like a worthy effort, but the vintage had the final say, lending a vegetal note to the wine's berry and cherry flavors. Give it time in a decanter, as airing does help bring out richer notes of cola and licorice.
This solid and powerful wine comes from a chateau right in the walls of Saint-Émilion. A dense texture brings out tannins and the wood-aging flavors. Spice, black currant fruitiness and a dark, dense character all promise aging. Drink from 2018.
With 16 months spent in 100% new French oak, this is a powerhouse of a wine. At first a bit overripe on the nose with notes of berry jam, kirsch, cigar box spice and a hint of smoke, the mouth shows similar concentrated dark fruit flavors but is lifted by supporting acidity, aggressive tannins and a tight structure. Dark chocolate-covered roasted espresso beans flood the long finish, and while the wine is good now, with five-plus years in the cellar it will be stellar.
Fresh roses and pomegranate juice shape the nose of this tonic, crisp rosé from Sicily (made with Nerello Mascalese grapes). The wine boasts a dark pink, almost blueish hue and offers a clean and refreshing feel in the mouth.
Racy, zesty aromas of honey and squeezed orange form the nose of this still-tight wine, a blend of 62% Grenache Blanc and 38% Rousanne from a vineyard at the mouth of the Arroyo Seco appellation. The crisp palate offers pear and apple cider flavors with a finish of honeydew melon. A perfect pairing for halibut and shellfish.
Deliciously ripe fruit, giving softness and power at the same time. The wine has rich strawberry and black plum fruits along with red currant freshness. At the same time, it has a complex structure of firm tannins, spice and wood. The end is more generous, opulent.
This Paso Robles-based winery has reached into cool-climate Edna Valley for their Chardonnay, with good results. The wine has good acidity and is dry and minerally, with citrus fruit flavors. Try with cracked crab and a well-buttered sourdough baguette.
This is an easy-gulping, light wine with fruity aromas, nice cherry and raspberry flavors, medium body and a soft mouthfeel.
Smells mature and slightly baked, with granular, sweet, raisiny core aromas. The palate is full in size and smooth in feel, with ripe berry flavors fading to raisin and prune on the back palate and finish. Chunky, flavorful and ready to drink now.
Concentrated, jammy fruit flavors meet full body and sturdy tannins in this well-made wine. It has a large presence due to alcoholic strength and the ripe spectrum of its fruit flavors, which includes raisin, black cherry and dried fig. Yet, tannins and acidity provide a firm texture that keeps it feeling balanced.
A slightly prickly nose that offers hints of green herbs and cactus sets up the citrusy palate, brimming with grapefruit, orange and green-herb flavors. The finish is shear and citrusy, with cleansing acidity.
The nose is funky and sweaty, with a hint of citrus and red-berry aromas. The palate is heavy and cloying, while generic flavors taste sticky, reedy and suggest no particular fruits. A light bitterness marks the finish.
An impressive Pinot. Shows massive fruity ripeness in a well-developed tannin structure, with good acidity, but it's really too young to drink now. Shows massive, primary flavors of black and red cherry pie filling, red plums and cola, with sweet, smoky, vanilla-infused oak influences. Hold until sometime in 2011.
This wine offers aromas of herbs, black cherry and spice, showing a bit of heat. The dark-fruit flavors have good intensity, with dry, astringent tannins backing them up.
Black pepper and baking spices surround a full-bodied and structured core of raspberry and black cherry in this small-production wine. It finishes in balance and with a touch of elegance.
Crisp, toasty oak and spice aromas are currently outranking this wine's berry-fruit components...but only for now. In five or more years, this will be less oaky and more complex. At this point in time, look for a sinewy, tight, almost jagged palate with toasty, robust flavors of plum and berry, dry spices and mixed herbs along with firm tannins. A long, balanced finish bodes well for the future. Drink through 2030.
Katnook's top Cabernet is always oaky, and the 2006 is no exception, featuring plenty of brown sugar and caramel aromas. Vanilla and cedar dominate the palate, forming an attractive wooden shell over cassis fruit. Drink it now if you like that sort of full-on youthful oak, or hold it a decade until it develops a soft, rich patina of age.
Pungent and pure up front, this 12-year-old Palo Cortado smells nutty and like toffee, with notes of orange peel and apricot. The palate reflects the bouquet, meaning it's clean and exact, with buttery flavors of dried nuts and not too much salt. This runs smooth on the finish and would be ideal in a savory soup or with sautéed mushrooms.
This wine aims to call attention to the tendency of Clone 17 (also known as the Robert Young clone) to provide baked apple and ripe, almond flavors and aromas, which this bottling does, in spades. Caramel, oak and vanilla round out the rest of the experience, which is balanced, but big in ripeness and wood.
Rich and fruity, this full-bodied wine holds ripe berry fruits that will be round and generous. A licorice flavor shows the extraction that needs to soften. Drink from 2016.
A shade too ripe, with a raisiny edge to the blackberries, cherries and chocolate. This 100% varietal Cab also feels soft and hot. But the tannins are wonderfully rich and fine.
This attractive, bright white opens with aromas of orange, green apple flesh and barely-ripe white peach. The light-weight mouth offers more of the same, alongside notes of melon rind and soft brioche. A slight creaminess is countered by brisk acidity, ending clean and refreshing. Drink now.
Jammy berry aromas come in front of green, vegetal notes. The palate is round and lacks balancing acidity.
This tight, brittle Pinot Noir isn't giving much pleasure now. It's distinguished in structure, with a fine, silky mouthfeel, brisk acidity and a pleasurable dusting of tannins. But it's a bit short on fruit. Give it a good airing and drink now.
A fresh and lively Chardonnay with flavors of pear, lemon and apple core. The medium weight mouthfeel comes off a bit sharp and prickly but closes crisp and clean.
Well integrated in terms of barrel use (listed as 60% used French oak and 40% new), this features a robust exuberance of fruit, from Asian pear to Meyer lemon. Spicy with a touch of nutmeg and ginger, it hones a fine line of minerality throughout.
Hints of white blossom mix with faint notes of pear to create a delicately balanced, fresh and spring-like wine that is as light as gossamer. This has verve and freshness, tender, blossomy aromatics and immense charm. Drink as soon as possible while its elderflower notes shimmer lastingly.
Tropical and citrus fruit aromas come with controlled skin-based bitterness. This has a full oily texture and flavors of lemon-lime and white pineapple. Fresh acidity on the finish keeps this clean and in good shape. Drink right away.
A bit tough and gritty in texture, with some rugged tannins and a green streak that cuts through the cherry fruit. Will benefit from decanting, but doesn't seem likely to improve with age.
Pronounced spice notes mark the nose of this lithe, aromatic wine. At only 11.1% alcohol, it shows no fat, just straightforward pineapple fruit and plenty of gingery-peppery spice. An off-dry finish and crisp acids make this a top choice to pair with Indian or Thai dishes.
This wine is ripe with a texture that remains tangy while also showing rich yellow and white fruits. A rustic edge adds interest rather than detracting from the quality. With its acidity and zesty citrus character, the aftertaste leaves a fresh, crisp feeling. Drink now.
This has finesse and elegance, with a thin stream of bubbles and crisp, dry apple flavor. It is taut with a cool feel, still young in the bottle and worth aging a year.
This is a good, dry Chardonnay, marked by brisk acidity and a steely minerality. The fruit veers toward pineapples and apricots, while oak adds notes of buttered toast and caramel. Feels like it wants to be richer than it is, but it's elegant.
This is a dark and sophisticated red, with an interesting aromatic profile that includes dried rosemary, sage, cola, blackberry, leather and spice. It's thick and powerful on the close and should pair well with red meat.
Slightly green aromas of olive and horsehide shadow generic plum and berry notes. This feels lively but scratchy and tartaric. Toasty flavors of black coffee outweigh plum and blackberry, while this burns a bit across an acidic finish.
Dark and thick in the glass, this blend of 82% Syrah and 18% Mourvèdre leads with black cherry syrup, smoked beef and dark chocolate aromas, which blossom as the wine opens. Rich and lavish on the palate, it has fine tannins that frame its blueberry, cassis and mocha flavors. It's firmly structured, with a lingering acidity.
Vintages of this wine have been variable, and this 2010 is like the so-so 2009, which earned the same score. It's an okay Pinot Noir, dry and earthy, but rather aggressive in acids and tannins. Ready to drink now.
Smoky, roasted aromas of black fruits, bacon and herbs are the kickoff. The mouthfeel is plump and full but offers vital acidity at its core. Flavors of black plum, hoisin sauce and savory spices finish smoky and ripe, with a lasting note of bacon. Drink through 2018.
This is the first vintage of this wine that will be available in the United States and it makes a positive first impression. It's a delicious blend of spice, floral notes and strawberries that finishes with soft, caressing tannins.
The winery continues to try to figure out how to grow Cabernet in this remote part of the county. Ripeness isn't the problem. Structure is. The flavors are upfront in blackberries, cherries and currants, but complexity and dryness remain challenges.
Based on Cabernet Sauvignon, this has a dark, penetrating color, with aromas of ripe blackberry and exotic spice. It shows firm, velvety tannins that should continue to evolve over the years.
Fresh on the nose with a vibrant apple and lychee perfume, this deliciously off-dry Gewürztraminer balances the variety's characteristic rose water and lychee fruit flavors with a hint of black tea and fragrant potpourri. Soft and luscious, it's a full-bodied, decadent wine.
Soft, rustic and slightly sweet, with jammy flavors of cherries, blackberries, pepper and smoky oak. Drink now.
This Bordeaux-style blend is 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot and 25% Cabernet Franc. It's on the rough and rustic side, showing ample stem and herbal flavors. Tannins are stiff and carry the impression that they did not achieve optimal ripeness.
Even at more than four years of age, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot remains huge in primary cherry, blackberry, cassis and chocolate flavors. The tough, astringent tannins make it essentially undrinkable now. Yet its underling wholesomeness and balance guarantee development through 2021, and possibly longer.
Richly fruity and soft, this wine boasts loads of black-cherry and plum flavors. Clearly made from very ripe fruit, it lacks the herbaceous-vegetal character so often found in Merlot, but also any sense of structure. Finishes with a bit of alcoholic heat.
A toasty yeast note has taken center stage of this blend of Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier, providing that uniquely Champagne-like accent to California's ripe strawberry, raspberry and lime flavors. Despite the ripe fruit flavors, the finish is dry and tart in acidity. It gets even better as it warms in the glass, displaying compelling complexities.
Inky berry and smoky, minerally aromas of charcoal properly introduce a saturated palate with tons of oak but even more fruit at its base. This supercharged Malbec is almost over the top, with massive blackberry, chocolate and molasses flavors. Burnt toast and chocolate mint-chip flavors on the finish confirm that this is a monster red. Drink through 2023.
This wine is half Cabernet Sauvignon, with the rest equal parts Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc and Merlot. Golden raisin, medicinal notes and abundant barrel spice aromas lead to full but balanced flavors backed by grainy tannins.
Similar to last year's Bordeaux blend, the 2008 is 55% Merlot, 18% Cabernet Sauvignon, and 27% Cab Franc. Forward and round, with broad strawberry fruit flavors. This is immediately accessible, likeable and softly appealing.
This opulent wine glides on the palate with richness combined with wonderful acidity. It is the intense freshness and sweetness that shows most strongly along with the super-rich, full texture. This is a superb wine for long aging, drink from 2018.
A wonderful Syrah, one of the most drinkable on the market. It's delicious, with thick, soft tannins housing dry, complex flavors of blackberries, black currants, cola, anise and black pepper.
One for the cellar. It's vibrantly rich and forward in blackberries, black cherries, plums, dark chocolate and sweet smoky new oak, yet very tannic. Creates an astringency that lasts through the spicy finish. It would be a pity to open it before 2012, and will last for years after.
This leads with aromas of white flower, toast and beeswax. The rather lean palate delivers yellow apple skin, citrus zest, a hint of roasted almond and a touch of vanilla alongside brisk acidity.
Yeasty, briney and strange on the nose, this feels clunky, with oily citrus and nut-driven flavors. It's bitter on the finish, and it doesn't show much in the way of mouthfeel. A blend of Chardonnay and Macabeo.
This easygoing, friendly wine features aromas of rose, violet and dark berry. On the palate, soft tannins lightly frame wild cherry and crushed raspberry flavors while a hint of vanilla adds interest. Drink through 2015.
A to Z has kept a lid on its pricing, and offers one of the best values in Oregon Pinot Noir. Though very young, this wine is soft and forward, and benefits from its early release. It could almost pass for a cru Beaujolais, from the slightly candied cherry fruit right down to the hints of banana that suggest a certain amount of whole cluster fermentation. In any event, it's fruity, lightly detailed with spice, and quite charming, though not as substantial as its 2006 predecessor.
Powerful yet still retaining a sense of restrained style, this wine is packed with ripe plum and sweet berry fruit flavors, laced with firm, dusty tannins. Acidity filters through the dense texture to give great freshness.
Aromas of violet, black plum and cassis lead the nose on this nearly opaque, purple-colored wine. The lively, one-dimensional palate offers black cherry, blackberry and a hint of black pepper alongside brisk acidity and a framework of tight tannins.
Dark gold in color, this appellation wine is tropical and salty, medium bodied with a strong taste of lemon preserves. Its fuller, richer nature is complemented by fresher streaks of grapefruit and mandarin, with a mineral component of wet stone.
Violet, iris, red-berry, toast, clove and menthol aromas take center stage. The mature palate offers oak, dried black-skinned berry, anise and a hint of tobacco alongside close-grained tannins. It's already rather shy on fruit richness so drink sooner rather than later. Drink 2018–2022.
A solid, structured wine, showing the fine tannins of the vintage along with ripe berry fruits. It has weight, acidity, without pushing the alcohol forward, remaining in balance. Age this wine for 3–4 years.
This is the winery's unoaked Chardonnay. It shows how well this cool-climate valley ripens Chardonnay, with deep, long tangerine, apricot and pear flavors, accompanied by brisk acidity. It's quite good, but would actually be better with a little oak to fatten and complicate it.
Though not as concentrated as many examples from this AVA, this brings identifiable Pinot Noir character, albeit in a rather thin, austere style. Pale cranberry and pomegranate fruit is matched to tart acidity and a veneer of herb.
A blend of Roussanne, Viognier, Grenache Blanc, Picpoul and Marsanne, this wine brings reserved aromas of apple skin, pear, almond and lemon verbena. The palate brings a sense of freshness and vibrancy, with a citric kick and an impressively long finish.
Floral and clean on the nose, with good red fruit and cherry flavors. By no means is this a fat-styled, extracted Malbec. Instead it's fresh and crisp, but tasty and pretty well balanced, especially if there's some food along for the ride. Imported by USA Wine Imports.
Whiffs of berry and pressed apple scent this slightly honeyed sparkling blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir. It's opulent and floral on the palate with a rich, mouth-clinging mousse that finishes sweetly with a hint of vanilla and biscuit.
Peàn (an 80-20 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc) is a round, supple and concentrated wine with a full, soft feeling in the mouth and a generously smooth texture. The aromas recall ripe cherry, chocolate and exotic spice.
This is smooth and light, with plenty of cocoa, mocha and coffee flavors around the light, pretty red fruits. Very creamy in the mouth, and ready to enjoy immediately.
While the orange, pear and green apple flavors of this Pinot Grigio seem sweetened by the vanilla and honey notes, the wine's brisk acidity balances it and makes finish dry and clean. This will make for a fine apéritif, and it will also pair well with slightly sweet Chinese, Vietnamese and Cambodian fare.
This is an almost weightless, acidic and lightly peppery white wine that shows vague hints of pale citrus—lime and lemon, and fresh cilantro. It doesn't taste much like the Roussanne varietal, but it might pass for a budget Grüner Veltliner in a blind tasting.
On first take, this smells high-toned and much like pine and sweat. With time, out come flavors of baking spices, vanilla, lychee, apricot and honeydew melon. On the finish, this is fresh, with flavors of vanilla and botrytis. Drink now.
This is the opposite of those gooey, cult-style wines grown down on the valley benches and floor. It's pure mountain in the tannins, acidity and dryness, with below 14% alcohol. It's a food wine, with cassis, cedar and mineral flavors. Should age well for a decade.
Mineral, dried peach, lees and honeysuckle aromas lead to just off-dry flavors. Racy acidity frames it nicely.
This has so much rich earth and minerality, it's like a journey deep into a mine. It's noted the vines were planted in 1970, and the wine does have that old-vine concentration of fruit in the form of massively intense blackberries. Then there's the smoky new oak, which adds such a lusciously sweet jacket of buttered toast. Tannic and tight in the way of Diamond Mountain Cabernets, this should begin to come into its own after 2016.
With fine concentration and crisp fruit, this is a young wine with a future. Ripe apples and lemon zest are balanced with a strongly mineral texture as well as spice. The wine is rich, and will develop over the next two years. Drink from 2018.
From a 2.4-acre vineyard with vines that are 60 years old, this is a tight, mineral wine, very pure and with a line of acidity and crisp apple flavors. Very perfumed, it is fresh but also densely textured, finishing with tannins and concentration as well as liveliness. Drink from 2018.
Good juice anchors this Cabernet blend, with the 13% Malbec and 10% Merlot filling in the flavors. Cassis and pomegranate notes hit first, followed by darker notes of cacao and coffee, dotted with black pepper.
This is a streamlined Chianti Classico with less heft and concentration on the palate and more light elegance. The nose imparts a sensation of cool harmony thanks to its measured tones of fruit, vanilla and toast. This is a clean, crisp wine with polished tannins and a smooth texture.
Rich plum, earth and spice aromas are followed by lush black cherry, blackberry, cassis, herb, coffee, chocolate and raspberry flavors. An intriguing floral edge runs through the core for added interest, all supported by firm, ripe tannins and fine body. The finish is long and smooth, with just a hint of brightness on the end. Made from 100 percent Cabernet Sauvignon. A first release from the folks who also make Harlan.
Delicate aromas of orchard fruit, grapefruit and a whiff of chopped herbs float from the glass. The racy, refreshing palate offers citrus zest, green apple and a hint of pear alongside racy acidity and an intense, persistent perlage.
Aromas of ripe raspberry, chocolate, black olive, and green herbs all combine in this well put together wine. The palate is taut and focused, with silky tannins, mouth-watering acidity and a long herbal finish. Tightly wound, this is best sipped with food or a few years of bottle age. Drink now–2024.
One of the only wineries built within the prestigious Cartizze Cru, Col Vetoraz delivers a rich Prosecco Superiore that shows the mineral depth and sweet fruity personality of the vineyard. The mouthfeel is creamy, generous and frothy.
This medium-bodied, easygoing red offers aromas of blue flowers, dark berry, underbrush and a whiff of cake spice. The palate delivers blackberry, red currant, ground pepper and a note of star anise alongside firm, refined tannins. An almond note backs up the finish.
From an appellation better known for Zin, this blend of 41% Cabernet Sauvignon, 26% Cabernet Franc, 21% Malbec, 8% Merlot and 4% Petit Verdot works well—a study in chocolate-covered blackberry and blueberry with a powerful firmness balanced by moderate acidity.
The Arinto is a local grape as far as Lisboa is concerned, and this wine seems right at home here. Made from old vines, it is fresh, tangy and destined to be drunk young with locally-caught Atlantic Ocean fish. The wine has a pure, clean, perfumed aftertaste. Drink now.
Standard fare, with baked, rubbery aromas and a tarry undercurrent. The palate is dense and packed, with sweet, medicinal flavors of brandied cherries and cassis. Rubbery and leathery in terms of mouthfeel, with a roasted, reduced quality to the finish.
Santa Sofia is a celebrated estate with its very own landmark villa that was designed by architect Andrea Palladio. That beautiful aesthetic is matched by its production of fine wines. This elegant wine has dark fruit aromas and spicy flavors.
A riper touch of russet-pear peel joins the fresh lemon notes on the nose. On the palate, zesty concentration becomes evident. This is compact and has impact but retains a juicy, friendly core that makes you want to sip more. Lemon ripeness continues through the long, dry finish.
This is the inaugural vintage of what is intended to be the flagship wine in the Milbrandt portfolio. It has rather light fruit flavors of mixed red berries and currants, a little spice and some toasty accents from barrel aging. Decanting may help to flesh it out.
The mouthfeel is full and creamy textured, the finish long and velvety in this easy-drinking example of Barossa Shiraz. Lovely vanilla and spice shadings mark the nose, accenting the flavors of ripe berries, licorice and chocolate. Drink now–2015.
Richly ripe in black cherry and chocolate, this is a blend of Merlot, Petite Sirah, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Zinfandel and Petit Verdot. Generous tannins give way to a soft, smooth mouthfeel and a burst of blackberry and leather, finishing in spicy cinnamon and black pepper.
With just 11% alcohol and an impressive production of 20,000 cases, this will have wide appeal. It's a flurry of pleasant, quaffable flower and peach notes. There is just enough residual sugar to give the finish a pulled taffy quality.
Great streaks of acidity cut across the ripe fruit. The wine has touches of toast from the 20% wood aging, along with a steely, more mineral character. These combine well with the peach and ripe apple flavors. Drink from 2015.
Tart, fresh and a bit chunky and rustic, this blend of 60% Syrah, 20% Grenache and 20% Cinsaut features bold lime notes, scouring acidity and hints of crushed stone. Drink now.
Some opening spice and a rich coating of milk chocolate are the main pleasures is this bottling. The strawberry flavor is light and peppery, the wine solidly made but sliding into a generic style.
Chewy tannins surround an elegant, structured wine, classic in red cassis, licorice and woody herbs. Powerful, it retains balance from start to finish, exuding the warmth of the vintage with the relative coolness of the appellation, marrying the two sides expertly together.
A full-bodied blend of 66% Mourvèdre, 30% Grenache and 4% Syrah bled off like a rosé and then fermented like a white wine, very reminiscent of a rosé from Provence. Dry, with prevailing flavors of strawberry and sweet spice, this Vin Gris is both pleasant enough to sip as an apéritif and bold enough to stand next to a range of food, seafood in particular.
Aromas of blackberry extract, leather, prune and a whiff of carob lead the nose and follow through to the dense palate along with a note of bitter chocolate. It's simple but well made, with solid, rounded tannins.
This ripe, charred, dark-as-night Malbec captures the lush essence of Argentina at its finest. Deep aromas of licorice, blackberry, coffee and toast set up a full, layered palate, with vanilla, baking spice, black plum and blackberry flavors. A lusty finish with licorice, mocha and tobacco notes is generous and dandy. Drink through 2023.
This mid-weight Chardonnay offers some complexity, with spicy and leesy notes accenting the apple-pear fruit. A touch of pineapple on the nose and vanilla on the palate add further interest. The mouthfeel is even, though the wine shows a bit of alcoholic heat. It finishes with good length, showing butter and spice notes.
While this finely crafted wine certainly has some richness, it brings out a cool, poised character, lightly aromatic. Currants and spicy citrus offer delicious crispness. Worth aging for 3–4 years.
This barrel selection is sourced from vines planted in 2002. It's young, fresh and delicate, showing a mix of rose water, cranberry and cherry fruit. The purity and depth are striking, and the balance is also just right. There's defining acidity and a finishing tang of orange peel.
Bright, lively and fruity, this is a delicious, crisp, dry Vinho Verde from the north of the region, close to Spain. It has citrus notes, a bright texture, lively acidity and a touch of spritz.
Perfumed and floral on the nose, but also spicy and slightly foresty, which is apropos for Syrah. Flavors of black olive, brandied cherry and blackberry are perfectly nice, and the feel is mildly creamy and rich but still pointed. Finishes with toasty notes of pepper, brown sugar and woodspice.
This opens with eucalyptus, dark spice and menthol aromas. The palate offers vanilla, cranberry white pepper and toast flavors framed by firm acidity and tight, grainy tannins.

The tannins are quite hard and dry, giving an astringency to this young Cab, but it's so rich in fruit, so long in the finish, that it will make a great partner with certain rich foods, especially lamb and grilled steak. There's a deep core of ripe blackberries, currants, dark unsweetened chocolate and pepper deep down inside this complex wine. Should develop through 2010.
Crispness is the hallmark of this light wine. It has bright fruit, a pure, clean taste, just a hint of herbs. Screwcap.

This is textbook Pinot Grigio Delle Venezie—meaning that fruit is sourced from anywhere within the region—with characteristic aromas of Golden Delicious apple, pear, natural rubber, yellow fruit, honey and a playful touch of citrus zest. Broad dimension and a spicy finish call for a dish like sweet and sour pork.
Aromas of sawdust, weedy underbrush and a hint of licorice lead the way and carry over to the palate. It lacks fruit richness, and you'll also notice the warmth of alcohol on the midpalate.
Here's a beautifully evolved Brunello di Montalcino (from Agricoltori del Geografico) that shows both elegance and harmony within layers of fruit, spice and earth. The wine articulates many of the most pleasurable characteristics associated with Sangiovese Grosso: elegance and liveliness.
This small-production single-vineyard Pinot Noir is dry, elegant and may be deceptively simple in its youth. It feels delicate now, almost fragile, with the suggestion of barely ripe cherries and cola that's been left out overnight so it loses its spritz. It's a wine of nuance, not power, and could easily develop dramatically over the next six years.
This opens with aromas suggesting dark-skinned berry, ground pepper and a whiff of flint. The solid, chewy palate shows mature plum, espresso and vanilla alongside ripe, robust tannins. Drink through 2018.

There is a good touch of honey here, with attractive fruit flavors and layers of almonds, spice and a ripe finish.
Hugely dense and dark, this is a powerful and concentrated wine. While all this structure is there, so are stylish fruits and the potential for suave elegance, which comes from the wood aging, the rich black fruits and the balance between tannin and fruit. Drink this impressive wine from 2018.
This Provençal-style blush is made from Syrah, Mourvèdre and Grenache. It's a good wine, dry and crisply acidic, but not without its faults. The main problem is a streak of green mint and vegetables. But there's enough sweet raspberry and cherry fruit to get by.
An excellent Verdejo from Rueda is as good as fresh, crisp white wine from Spain gets. And the two Victorias that make José Pariente know their stuff. After an overly ripe 2005, this vintage shows more of Pariente's patented lemon, citrus and mango flavors. The feel of the wine is super solid and the finish is long and properly acidic. It's a treat for fans of Spanish whites.
Nanfrè is an easy-going Valpolicella blend of 70% Corvina and 30% Rondinella grapes that offers fresh berry tones of raspberry and blueberry backed by a touch of almond paste and white chocolate. It's thin, compact and very refreshing on the close: Pair it with ravioli stuffed with ricotta and spinach.
From the same Bakers Gully Vineyard as Clarendon Hills' Bakers Gully Shiraz, this is a full-bodied Shiraz with bold vanilla and saddle leather aromas and flavors of brambleberries. Rustic notes include hints of rubber or Band-Aid, but they're in the background, while warm berries, vanilla and roasted coffee notes lead the way. Drink now.
This offers aromas of new oak, coconut and a whiff of exotic spice that carry over to the underripe palate along with tart cranberry and an orange zest note. It lacks the fruit richness needed to stand up to the oak while raspy tannins leave an astringent finish.

Here's a delicious and structured white that opens with an intensely floral fragrance of hawthorne and Spanish broom. The palate delivers flavors of fleshy white peach, apple and pear, along with a bitter almond note. The creamy fruit is brightened by crisp acidity that leaves a clean finish. Worldwide Cellars, Sussex Wine Merchants.
From a cool part of the valley, this wine is marked by fresh acids that give it a grapey jamminess. It's very rich in black cherries, black raspberries and toast, and very dry. Feels sharp and angular now. Give it through 2010 to calm down.

Blueberry, graham cracker and mild herbal notes define the nose on this high-altitude Malbec from Chile. The palate is rich and a bit zingy, with jammy density and mountainous flavors of boysenberry, blueberry and toast. A pure and zesty finish is the right ending to this dark, lusty Malbec.
Bone dry and delicately structured, it has good acidity cutting across herb tea, apricot, orange rind and white pepper flavors. The wine shows some true complexity and interest.
Ripe, very soft and missing out on zesty freshness, this wine is full-bodied and on the heavy side. It does have attractive strawberry fruitiness and some acidity that comes through at the end.
Smoky and oaky, this is a blend of 85% Petite Sirah and 15% Petit Verdot, creating one black, dense, vanilla-infused package that's rich and ready to drink now.
Here is a quintessentially luminous and fragrant white wine from southern Italy (made with 100% Chardonnay, two thirds of which was aged in oak) that delivers food-friendly appeal, succulence and a sophisticated approach. The wine is thick and luscious on the palate and offers slightly sweet flavors of exotic fruit, mango and papaya.
Honeysuckle and green apple aromas follow over to the lively palate along with pear and a hint of lime. Vibrant acidity and a lively perlage give it a clean energized finish.

Loads of toasty vanilla from new oak sits on top of blackberry aromas in this dense, non-vintage red. The velvety palate lacks depth but leads to a long, cherry-flavored finish. Drink with grilled sausages.

Tasted with over a decade of bottle aging, this late-release Spätlese is a heart-stopper. The core of this delicately honeyed wine is still vibrantly fruity, concentrated in luscious yellow peach and cherry flavors.

The Valencia region has never been known for world-class wines, but this is exemplary. Aromas of sweet plum, boysenberry, blueberry and minerals lead into a structured, full-bodied palate with wild berry, cassis and herbal flavors. A lively palate is the antithesis of shy, while firm acidity keeps this fresh. Drink through 2018.
A tiny bottling (220 cases) of old-vine Grenache, this wine features lovely aromas of cinnamon, clove and ripe cherries. In the mouth it's surprisingly elegant, delivering cherry and spice flavors without excessive weight, ending on a slightly tart note. Drink now and over the next 4–5 years.
Salinic and pungent, with celery, green citrus and nettle aromas. This is pure SB, although it's not 100% SB because Secreto always has a little something else in the blend. Fresh, acidic and alive, with lime and slightly pickled accents to the finish.
Aromas of black currant jam, plum compote and menthol entice on the nose of this Teran (Refosco in Italy) from Istria, but there's a dense, broad feel to this wine that detracts from the deep black fruit and supple tannins that are otherwise quite pleasant.
Great concentration and textural density make this full-bodied and firmly structured wine stand out.

This barrel selection shows its wood-aged flavors strongly in a spicy toasty character. It does need time to bring out the ripe red fruits that are rich as well as crisp. Drink this serious wine with its firm tannins still intact from 2018.
This is the equivalent of a third wine from Château Giscours, a blend that is ready to be drunk young. Young is a relative term in this structured vintage, although it is already possible to see the rich fruitiness that will be in place soon. Drink this still-firm wine with potential from 2017.
Austere and severe, this single-vineyard wine is very much a product of its limestone terroir. It has a mineral intensity that pushes through the tannins and black currant fruit, giving a powerful, dark character. Firm and structured, this is a wine for the long term.

Big but well poised and supple, this luxuriously ripe-tasting, mouthfilling, semisweet wine has enormous fruit flavors of black cherry and black currant wrapped in velvety, fine-grained tannins. It's so smooth that it's firm structure is not readily apparent.
Beautifully aromatic notes of ripe citrus peel rise from the glass—think tangerine and juicy clementine. These flavors become more zesty on the full-flavored, concentrated but linear palate.

There is great balance, lasting length and beautiful poise. Drink 2017–2025.

The most gentle strawberry fruit appears unobtrusively on the nose. The palate reveals incredibly pure and honest wild strawberry fruit. The palate is slender but totally concentrated—there is depth to the wine and something ethereal and utterly seductive. This is not about power but about arresting allure. The true nature of Pinot Noir has been captured here, without force, without guile. This is honest and all the more disarming for that.
A solid wine, showing some generosity and richness, the fruits displaying a fine balance between sweetness, dry tannins and bright acidity. It has some of the sensuous character of good Volnay, opening into ripeness. Worth aging for several years, but already offering considerable pleasure.
Soft and superripe, with flavors of red currants and dried orange peel. Although the wine is fully dry, there's something Porty about it.

This bottling has made dramatic improvements over the years.

This is quite oaky upfront, with bold scents of baked apple, toasted hazelnut and vanilla bean. The palate offers more of the same, in addition to a bright yet decadent lemon-custard flavor. Honey-drizzled apple pie comes to the fore on the finish, with just enough acidity to keep the opulence in check.
Soft, sweet rosé, with a caramel and sugared strawberry character. A light wine for those who want less alcohol than is found in a white Zinfandel.
The alcohol is over the top; at nearly 16%, it shows both heat and sweetness. As tasty as the briary wild berry flavors are, the wine is just unbalanced.
With its massively concentrated blackberry fruit framed in ample new oak, this bears a bit of resemblance to some Australian Shirazes. It's mouthfilling but supple, with nuances of Christmas spices like cinnamon, clove and anise that linger on the long finish. Drink 2014–2023.

As usual with Duckhorn's red wines, this Merlot is more tannic and acidic than most anything coming from Napa Valley. They're emphasizing structure over decadence. But that's not to say there aren't rich, elaborate berry, cherry, currant, chocolate and cedar flavors that provide bang for the buck. Very elegant and refined, this Merlot should be decanted before serving.
This reserve-level P.X. sets the gold standard for excellence in sweet sherry. The lovely bouquet straddles the line between unadulterated sweetness and impeccable slyness. The flavors of fig, chocolate, caramel, browned butter and cinnamon are amazing. So chewy and thick, but balanced by firm acids. Brilliant.
This is a well-constructed, with 95% of the grapes from Napa Valley and the rest supplied from nearby Lake County. Merlot makes up 85% of the wine; the remainder is Cabernet Sauvignon. Hearty, it offers juicy plum and black cherry as well as streaks of cedar and black pepper. The tannins are soft and integrated while the finish hints at mocha and chocolate.

Focused in the mouth with just a touch of creaminess, the Logan offers pear and nutmeg flavors, and a hint of green apple on the finish. It's not a mouthfilling, overly flashy wine, but this could be a good thing if you're pouring it with dinner. Try it with your first-course seafood dish.
This feels like a cool-climate Sauvignon, with light melon and citrus flavors, alcohol at just 12%, and a bone dry finish. This blend of Cabernet and Syrah shows pretty fruit flavors of strawberry and cherry candy, with a bit of cinnamon spice. Light and lively, it's a style more reminiscent of the sort of wine you might encounter in a carafe in a seaside town in the south of France.
While there are powerful tannins at work here, this wine is mainly full of rich black fruits that have a juicy side from the acidity. The addition of Tannat brings even more tannin to the wine while also giving it density and longevity. Drink from 2019. The wine comes from a long-time wine family that tended the few remaining Malbec grapes that survived phylloxera of late 1800s. Alain Gayraud is the current owner.
This small-lot, dry Pedro Ximénez is maderized and oxidized, but also interesting. The nose is waxy and resiny, with dusty peach and apricot aromas. In the mouth, it's complex and mature, however the flavors are bitter and subdued, with corn and wheaty notes. A bready, honeyed finish brings things around. Just 90 cases made.
Dry and rather scoury, with a rough mouthfeel. But it's clean and bone dry, and shows proper sparkling wine flavors of citrus, vanilla, yeast and green apple.
Dark concentration and soft aromas of cherry and spice open the nose with bright determination. They are segued by leather, ash and sweet tobacco. This naturally tannic wine leaves your mouth bone dry.

This is a dense, chocolaty and plummy wine, on the full-bodied side, with modest tannins to provide balance. A bit chunky, but satisfying, with bold, fleshy flavors and hints of caramel.
The centerpiece of Phil Sexton's current venture (he previously founded and sold both a brewery and a winery) is this single vineyard, from which he makes a Pinot Noir and this wine. The 2012 Chard is a bold yet elegant wine, filled with grilled pineapple and citrus fruit and framed by hints of toasted nuts, vanilla and graphite.
Big and earthy, with char, savory spice and black fruit aromas. The palate is full and bold, with ripe tannins and delicious flavors of herbs, baked berries, integrated spice and leather. Smooth, long and muscular; made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Carmenère and Syrah.
Perfumed wood dominates this wine, giving it structure and tannins. Juicy red fruits are still submerged beneath this welter of dryness. The wine needs time to integrate. Drink from 2019.
It's great to find both lots of fruit and good structure in a Zin, especially at such a reasonable price. Spicy aromas like vanilla and nutmeg precede vivid and ripe fruit flavors and more of those oaky spices on the palate where firm tannins and a bite of acidity give a mouthwatering balance.
With a large dose of Russian River Valley grapes, this delirious and delicious white is dark gold in color, medium to almost full bodied, with a richness overridden by bright floral notes of apple blossom and pear. It finishes in a flurry of oak and vanilla, and was aged in new and used French and American oak.
The winery's approach is to let the Pinot Gris fruit shine through. They put a tiny amount of oak on it, but it's primarily stainless steel fermented. Tastes fresh and crisp and appley, with notes of peaches and citrus fruits that finish thoroughly dry.
This opens with stewed plum, pressed rose, ground pepper and toast aromas. The palate is austere, with bracing tannins and dried cherry, star anise and sage flavors.
This precious dessert wine opens with a gorgeous and deeply luminous golden color and segues into aromas of honey, apricot and mature peach. It lacks huge intensity but you can taste those warm, Tuscan roots in the fruit.
Mostly neutral aromas include hints of strawberry and chewing gum. This wine feels dilute, with tangy, tart flavors of pink grapefruit. Pointy, sharp acidity allows the finish to hang around.
This complex wine shows a whiff of stem, from 37% whole-cluster fermentation, and quickly moves into a soft center, loaded with strawberry preserves. It coats the mouth, smooth and textural, with graphite highlights. The tannins are substantial and suggest it's worth tucking into the cellar for a few more years. Drink through 2020.
A good, rugged Petite Sirah, with the bigtime fruit and heavy tannins the variety is known for. Just bursts across the palate with blackberries, plums, cassis and peppery, leathery notes.
Clear and light in color, this dusty smelling Cava offers aromas of briny peach and citrus fruits. The palate is solid, with a round texture and flavors of sulfur, lemon-lime, tangerine and nectarine. A tight, lean finish feels minerally but tastes a bit gaseous.
An alluring nose of violets, berries and a touch of spice begins this stylish wine from Waterford. On the palate, flowers, spice and minerals unfold and mingle with elegance. The tannins are pronounced but refined. The wine will age and offer more as time passes, but it's a gorgeous sip today.
Too soft for comfort. Lacks structural integrity and lively acidity to balance out the rich blackberry, currant, anise and cocoa flavors, and there's peppery heat from high alcohol. Drink now.
Smells Porty, tastes bitter and rustic, with the flavor of shriveled raisins. Basically a Bordeaux blend with a little Petite Sirah.
Dusty mineral and pollen notes lend savory complexity to sunny tangerine and honey on the palate of this kabinett. It's not a deeply penetrating wine but delicate tangerine sweetness and zippy acidity feel vital and fresh. Drink now.
Delicious. This is a full-bodied blush bubbly with instant appeal, from the coppery color to the long, spicy finish. Shows lush flavors of creamy raspberries and red cherries, brioche, vanilla and cinnamon spice, with a nutty sweetness. Elegant and complex. Drink now.
A big drop off from prior years, probably due to the cold harvest conditions of 2008. Smells minty and lactic, with hard spice and distant fruit aromas. Feels closed, tannic and clipped, with narrow berry flavors and green notes. Toasty on the finish, but also clacky feeling. Good relative to other wines, but not at $70.
Here is a fresh and straightforward expression of Pinot Grigio with vibrant notes of exotic fruit, papaya and pear. In the mouth, the wine tastes lean, crisp and very cooling.
Dolcetto Vigna Costa Fiore opens with a dense, modern appearance and big aromas of ripe fruit and mature blackberry. There's also a touch of Band Aid or wet animal at the back that is barely perceptible now, but that may worsen with time. The wine is chewy and bright on the close.
The aromas are super spicy, with cinnamon-glazed sour cherries proving most dominant. On the palate, black cherry and beet juice pair up with black tea, before culminating in a remarkably long and tantalizing spice-driving finish.
Dry and very crisp in acidity, with that petrol or diesel edge Riesling is known for, this is a distinctive wine. The other flavors include peaches, oranges, honeysuckle flowers and spices. It's a beautiful wine that shows the classic noble structure of the Riesling grape.
Fragrant and bright, this offers aromas of rose, iris, perfumed berry and a balsamic note. The palate is still rather closed, offering raw red cherry, star anise and chopped sage alongside tightly knit tannins and brisk acidity. It still needs time to come together. Drink 2018–2024.
Among full-bodied, old-vines Malbec, this is an unbridled winner. The nose is rooty and sweet, but also inky and dark. And the palate is totally pure, with snappy tannins, fine acidity and loads of black fruit flavor mixed with tobacco and coconut. Racy, juicy and delicious as it enters its prime. Drink now through 2013.
Yes, 1997 is the current vintage. Reviewers gave this wine's bouquet two thumbs up—it has lovely aromas of wheat biscuit, mint and cassis. Our biggest gripe here was the wine's weight—which, for a Cabernet from a good vintage, was pretty light. Still, it had some pleasant cherry, red plum and earth flavors.
Dark garnet in the glass, this wine has a bouquet of black cherry, vanilla and anise. Flavors of black cherry, raspberry, chocolate and violet roll on the tongue amidst almost chewy tannins that are kept in check by bright acidity. There is a strong note of cranberry on the finish and a touch of chocolate on the post-palate.
A curiously spicy, herbal wine that seems to have lost its fruit. There is a bitter edge that may soften over the next few months.
This has an earthy nose of truffle and tobacco leaf, with a hint of leather. The palate shows some rustic notes along with overripe plum, black berry and spice. While this has tight, drying tannins, the fruit and freshness are evolved.
This vintage the wine is comprised of Malbec, Cabernet and Petit Verdot. It's a deeper, darker, richer wine than the '07, with which it was co-released, and equally high-scoring. Almost sweetly jammy in black cherries, raspberries, cola and caramelized oak, it's rescued by firm tannins and a finish that dries it out in minerals and spices. Now–2016.
Vanilla toast and a compelling yeasty character on the nose entice. It's a little brighter on the palate, offering a balanced combination of minerality, acid and cream that lingers.
This smells and tastes like cherry candy, butter and vanilla. It's rather light in body and concentration but has plenty of oak accents and a touch of sweetness.
Here's a great Sauv Blanc sure to please on warm, sunny days. Prominent but not overdone tropical fruit notes play with soft peony and citrus on the nose and mouth. Lighter in weight with great, balanced acidity and a crisp, appropriately tingly finish.
95-97 Barrel sample. A huge, muscular wine. Brooding and intense, but the tannins keep themselves in order. Very different from its stablemate, La Mission Haut-Brion.
Made entirely from Sangiovese, this informal red has subdued aromas suggesting dark spice and plum. The simple palate delivers prune fruit with a sprinkling of clove and laid-back, fleeting tannins. Drink soon.
Made with 40% Nero d'Avola, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon and 30% Merlot, this suggests aromas of toast, espresso, pressed violet and baked plum. The straightforward palate offers dried black cherry, black currant and a hint of cake spice alongside fine-grained but not very persistent tannins. Drink now to capture the remaining fruit.
This is one of those hammer-over-your-head reds that takes aromatic intensity to the stratosphere. Inky black in color with cracked white pepper, exotic spice, resin, crushed stone, cedar, cherry fruit marmalade; there are no subtle nuances here, only bold statements. Imported by Palm Bay Imports.
This easy, youthful red wine from Tuscany delivers warm, earthy tones with background tones of red berry, cassis and dried blueberry.
Muddy Water's 2007 James Hardwick Riesling is made in a ripe, off-dry style, marrying high (for Riesling) alcohol of 13% with considerable residual sugar (16 g/l). The result is a medium-bodied wine combining subtle mineral and lime shadings and lingering sweetness balanced by tart acids.
This complex Chardonnay shows lots of smoky-sweet oak, with notes of buttered toast that are perfectly integrated with flavors of Asian pear, tropical fruits and spices. There's a wonderfully pure minerality that, together with brisk acidity, gives the wine a bracing quality.
The price is right. It's soft and sweet, with jammy, candy flavors.
About as pale in color as they come, this wine is not light on flavor. It has bright citrus and dried herb aromas and similarly assertive flavors, backed by crisp acidity. It should pair perfectly with seafood and is bold enough for grilled garlic prawns.
Rich and fruity, this is a dense, wood-aged wine. It has a perfumed character as well as ripe tannins and blackberry fruits. The wine is broad, rounded and full of fruit. Drink this attractive, concentrated wine now.
Lovely and fresh notes of red apple are joined by a livelier tangier citrus note on the nose. The dry palate is very light, almost weightless and fizzes away with a very fine mousse. There is real depth of fruit and a knowingly light touch. It is lovely as an elegant apéritif but sophisticated enough to be served alongside food. The finish is tart, lasting and grown-up.
Compacted aromas of blueberry, rubber, smoky oak and leather precede a jammy, widespread palate with tannic grab. This tastes of woody, savory berry fruits, while the finish is short, a touch salty and moderate in depth and complexity.
Savory whiffs of ramps and pollen blow off with aeration to reveal fresh scents of tangerine and apple. On the palate, it's off dry with intensely concentrated flavors of pink grapefruit and white peach. Zesty lime acidity lingers on the finish.
Soft, melted and sweet, like a cherry, blueberry and chocolate dessert in liquid form. Overripe, too. The official alcohol is 15.5%.
Aromas of herbs, tar and plum lead to sweet, plush blue fruit flavors. It's not a particularly serious wine but brings plenty of appeal.
Vibrant and juicy with red cherry and blueberry playing well alongside notes of thyme and soft pepper spice. Medium weight in the mouth with soft grain tannins, solid acidity, and a finish that leaves a delicious raspberry syrup flavor lingering until the next sip. Drink now or hold for a year.
This is from Seven Hills vineyard grapes, soft on entry with spicy, warm, black cherry and blackberry fruit, wrapped nicely in well-integrated barrel flavors. Mocha, chocolate, hints of mulberry and a soft, fruity midpalate that seems to fall off just a bit at the tail end.
The Haut-Brion winemaking team produces this ripe wine that has a sense of elegance, with black currant flavors and warm, soft tannins. At the end, the juicy fruit triumphs, giving a wine that's ready to drink now.
The wine has a beautiful texture; it's rich, velvety and silky. With some Petite Sirah and Carignan for complexity, it shows wild berry, exotic spice, coffee, leather and cola flavors. My quibble, and it's a fairly substantial one, is the heat and candied sweetness on the finish.
Tart apple scents on the nose become fully fledged on the frothy palate. Granny Smith flavors are met with some creamy autolysis notes of shortbread but the zingy tartness remains. The finish is dry, sprightly and clean-cut.
Raspberries cooked in butter with a clove spice appear on the nose of this wine from Monterey County. It's rich with sage-tinged blackberry juice flavors on the palate, also showing a plum-skin tartness and pencil shavings.
This is fruity, with a strong showing from the spirit. The wine is ripe with touches of wood aging and red fruit flavors. However, it does lack acidity.
Aromas of wild rose, chopped mint and an earthy whiff of grilled Porcini mushroom slowly emerge. The taut, austere palate shows cranberry, raw sour cherry, star anise and clove framed in firm acidity and tightly wound, close-grained tannins that clench the finish. This needs time to unfurl and fully develop. Drink after 2023.
Dusty berry and plum aromas are inviting and come with notes of vanilla and coconut. This blend of Cab Sauvignon, Malbec and Cabernet Franc is flush while displaying a firm grip. Flavors of vanilla, mocha, black cherry and blackberry finish deep and with a lasting hint of fig. Drink through 2024.
The wine is all about fruit and balanced tannins. It is juicy, so drinkable now, although with enough structure to promise good aging. Perfumed black-currant fruits show strongly. The wine shows how this chateau continues to perform reliably. Drink from 2020.
Big, awkward aromas of red fruit and oak are followed by simple berry and plum flavors and even more overt oak. The finish is big and warm, while late in the game the wine turns tangy. This is one of many mass-market Merlots with few glaring faults; but still it fights to rise above basic acceptability.
Pino is a new Oregon entry from the Bronco Wine Company. This fragrant wine, from Willamette Valley grapes, brings fleshy pear fruit and penetrating spices. There's big, forward flavor to spare, with just a slight burn in the finish.
The nose on this wine by Burgundy-raised veteran vintner Christian Roguenant is very minerally and focused, showing chalk, crushed sea shells, lemon rind and a touch of Marcona almond. The texture is pleasantly grippy and taut, containing flavors of white peach, grapefruit pith and baking soda, all of which sail deep into the finish.
Minty and sheer on the nose, and that's a prime indicator of what's to come, namely high-toned, lean fruit flavors and an abundance of scouring, protruding acidity. Some oak lingers to soften things, but overall this is a sharp, underdeveloped style of Cabernet.
This soft and rounded wine offers gentle acidity and warm cherry flavors. It's full, touched by smoke and a red plum skin texture. Give this attractive wine until 2015 for its full potential to show.
Floral and funky, this combines 47% Syrah, 42% Malbec, 10% Cabernet Franc and 1% Viognier. Medium-strength, it's a rustic, dusty wine with notes of blackberry, blueberry and a touch of dried herb.
This bold, earthy Malbec delivers aromas of cured meat and stewed notes, with some medicinal and floral smells. It's concentrated and chewy but not syrupy, with roasted plum and berry flavors running side by side with savory spice, pepper and brown sugar. A toasty finish has mild heat to it.
This Pinot Gris has aromas of wax, red apple, underripe white peach and citrus. The white peach note becomes more dominant on the easygoing palate, and it leads to a mineral-like tang that lingers onto the slightly yeasty finish.
Big and flamboyant, an impressive Chardonnay whose flavors are explosive. Tangerines, blood oranges and tropical fruits are massively enriched by sweet oak. Coastal acidity provides a fine, minerally backbone. A complex, delicious wine. Don't drink it too cold.
You could drink this Frappato slightly chilled with white meat or fish. It's a delicate and fragrant wine with crisp acidity and simple berry fruit flavors.
This wine is way too light, too fresh and without much in the way of structure. Green fruit and acidity are dominant with just hints of red fruits.
There's a bright note of wild berry, orange peel and red apple at the very start that fades away quickly to reveal savory tones of cured meat, leather and coffee grounds. It's compact and powerful, but not over the top.
Candied mandarin peel and apricot join the rose-petal flavors that meet on an unctuous, rich palate. Residual sweetness gives this considerable heft but the overall balance is there, with a soft-focus finish that carries both fruit and spice.
Here's a straightforward and simple white wine that delivers fresh peach and citrus aromas backed by a touch of bitter almond. The texture is thick and creamy.
From the grape variety known as Coda di Volpe (“fox's tail”), this is a fresh, flowery white loaded with apple, pineapple and mineral flavors. Ends with spice and mineral notes. Drink now.
Light white peach, apple blossoms, jasmine and intriguing green-tea aromas show on the nose of this widely available blend of various white varieties. It's a tad sweet on the sip, with poached apples, nectarine, honey, lemon curd and baked-orange flavors.
This is a best barrel blend of Goldeneye's several vineyards. It takes its beautifully ripe fruit from Confluence and the tannins of The Narrows to yield a dry, densely constructed and moderately ageable wine of exceptionally high quality and appeal. Blackberries, blueberries, cherries and exotic spices characterize the flavors of this tremendous wine, one of the best of the vintage out of the Anderson Valley. Only 222 cases were produced.
Apricot blush in color, this wine has aromas of tangerine and strawberry. Flavors of tangerine, orange blossom and grapefruit persist into the bright finish.
From one of the best producers in the little-traveled region of Molise on Italy's Adriatic flank, this wine shows the far reaches of the Aglianico grape in southern Italy. This expression shows bright fruit tones of blackberry and cherry, backed by velvety tannins.
92-94 Barrel sample. Smoky, tobacco aromas, a wine that slowly reveals its powerful fruits, its tense tannins and a dry, very firm structure. Impressive.
Smells ashy, and then turns simple and direct, offering pleasant fruit, herb and spice flavors in a silky texture. A sound, everyday wine that gets the basic Pinot Noir idea across.
Toasty oak cradles this wine, while flavors of yellow fruits shine through. The wine has a smooth, light body, with nice balance, and finishes crisp, with more oaky nuance.
A big improvement over the 2007, Stephens' '08 is rich and ripe. It brims with pineapple, buttered toast, vanilla and cinnamon flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. Easy to drink, and delicious through the finish.
Offers up pretty white peach and floral aromas, while the palate deals some pink grapefruit and grass notes. Not very giving flavorwise; with more acidity, it would be just the thing for oysters.
This blend of 37% Grenache, 37% Syrah and 26% Mourvèdre is brooding, with its char, smoke, cranberry, dark plum and woodspice aromas. On the palate, silky black cherry flavors are accented with barrel-derived notes, striking a lovely balance.
Top lots from Sheridan, Dineen and Meek vineyard grapes go into this reserve. This is always the most thick and dense of the Stevens wines, and the tannins, though very well managed, are chewy and substantial. They dominate this young wine, but the stacked and subtle layers of red and black fruits, leaf and forest floor materials, moist earth and ashes keep the flavors complex and interesting. This wine absolutely must be decanted, and can be cellared almost indefinitely.
86-88 Barrel sample. Too spicy, without compensating fruit, this property, owned by the French aircraft-making family, is performing below high expectations.
While blackberry and cherry notes are lush and ripe on the nose, this Finger Lakes Zweigelt is surprisingly elegant on the palate. Sour cherry and tart plum flavors are concentrated and juicy, but lively in feel. The finish is extended by a fringe of fine, polished tannins.
Fruity and light, this is a Vinho Verde that is on the light, sweet side. It has ample acidity to go with the sherbet flavor. This ready to drink wine would be a good apéritif.
Prune, leather, oak, vanilla, underbrush and mint aromas lead the nose. The austere palate isn't very expressive, showing subtle oak, toast and espresso in the forefront with notes of dried cherry alongside tightly drying tannins.
Simple and off-dry, with all sorts of fruity, flowery and spicy flavors, this wine shows off high, crisp Monterey acidity, which makes it finish clean. The alcohol is a comfortable 13%.
Amazingly ripe and deep wine from 2004, so it's all that it's going to be. Thick and figgy aromas bring bacon, mint and cool, cushiony cola notes. The palate is megasaturated with chocolaty oak and dark berry power galore. Remains oaky on the finish; a massive wine to drink now through 2017.
Bright, ripe strawberry and cherry flavors are contrasted with the firm tannins of wood aging. This is a very young wine, with layers of acidity, spice and toast. Drink from 2016.
A good, everyday Cabernet marked by attractive blackberry, cherry, currant and oak flavors. It's dry and the tannins are rich and supple.
Forest floor, ripe black fruit, truffle, leather and balsamic aromas open this bold, concentrated wine. The delicious palate offers layers of blackberry, spicy plum, black pepper, cassis and savory herb alongside big, velvety tannins. It has balance and depth but it's still young and needs time to develop complexity. Drink 2018–2030.
A nice Zinfandel that's dry and fruity, with briary, brambly blackberry, tobacco and spice flavors. It's a clean, vibrant Zin, but a very tough, tannic one. Needs ultrarich fare to crack through the astringency.
One of the special cuvées from du Cèdre, this impressive wine combines intense black fruit freshness with a powerful structure. It is full of cidity, ripe fruits and a core that is immense. It deserves considerable aging and certainly should not be drunk before 2020.
Voluptuous notions of orange oil segue into a more earthy notion of lemon-anointed autumn leaves. Lots goes on here: the fresh peel of rosy apples, grated lemon zest and wet earth, all combined on a very smooth palate. This is highly drinkable and full of moreish allure.
Bright edged and minerally. The wine has a strong lemon and herb component as well. Very zippy on the finish.
Sultry black cherry, clove and crushed graphite show on the nose of this single-vineyard study from Winemaker Paul Clifton. That baked black-cherry power arises strongly on the palate as well, with lots of allspice and star anise. The wine finishes crisp, wiping the palate clean.
A richly spicy wine, showing its wood aging in the mint flavors as well as toast. Despite a dodgy harvest year, the wine has the dense, ripely fruity character that comes from winemakers João Menezes and Francisco Montenegro's use of foot treading and fermentation in open stone lagars and that gives great black fruits and soft tannins. This is a wine that is powerful and concentrated, ready to age for a few more years. Drink from 2020.
Made with 100% Chardonnay, this Sicilian sparkler opens with yeasty aromas of toasted bread crust and whiffs of fragrant flowers. The vibrant palate delivers citrus and yellow apple alongside a polished mousse.
Deliciously crisp, this wine expresses herbaceous fruit, with weight and richness. Full of lime, gooseberry and grapefruit flavors, this is a taut wine that's likely to soften.
Yeasty funk still dominates the nose and only lets a touch of lemon zest through. The palate continues with the zesty background against which flashes of riper fruit appear: juicy pear and luscious tangerine. The fruit expression is ripe but utterly fresh. The taut dry palate is anchored in something cool and fresh, something that expands as texture and fills not only the palate but also the mind. This is fresh and luminous, elegant and fine boned. Drink now through 2030.
Aromas of spice, red fruit and milk chocolate are followed by an opulent palate of fruit and barrel flavors. It appeals on every level.
The fragrant floral nature of Riesling shines through on the fresh nose. The palate also holds this lemony freshness, harnessed by small bubbles fizzing away on the lively, slender, dry palate. A streak of lemony acidity adds some extra brightness.
Lithe and slick, this has broad apple flavors and loose acids.
Gli Archi comes from a quality-minded producer and exhibits a lighter, more traditional appearance compared to other ripassos. It has elegant nuances of wild berry, cherry cola and tobacco. There is some volatility here, but it only serves to increase the wine's natural intensity. Imported by Monarchia Matt International.
Only produced in the best years, this is a finely made wine. It has ripe, concentrated fruits that are juicy when youthful and that will develop well. Black currants and berries push through the still firm tannins bringing with them intense acidity. All these elements will allow the wine to age well. Drink from 2019.
Technically a Zin blend labeled as Old Vine Wine, Serious is velvety in texture with supple tannins and a complex taste of blueberry compote and cinnamon spice. With a brightness on the finish, it'll age and be interesting with food like venison or other game.
Vinegary overtones suggest a volatile wine from the first sniff. Flavors are high-toned as well, with plum and cherry. Some sort of barrel treatment brings in dark chocolate and espresso, with slightly burnt, bitter tannins.
Whole-cluster pressed and fermented in French oak barrels, about one third new, this pure Marsanne is a deep gold, and scented with buttery, oily oak and vanilla. It's full in the mouth, bright and high-toned, with a mix of stone fruits.
Well-integrated blueberry and purple flower aromas make for a casual rather than bombastic nose in this blend of 32% Syrah, 28% Grenache, 25% Mourvèdre and 15% Petite Sirah. Roasted meat, charred blackberry and dried fennel notes show on the palate, feeling very balanced and acid-even.
Sumptuous red cherry, wrapped in velvety structure, presents a ripe and rounded Pinot Noir with earthy, autumnal edges. It offers lovely balance and constant glimpses of red fruit, oaky spice and soft yet crunchy midpalate mouthfeel. This will benefit from holding 2016–2017 in bottle.
Berry aromas accompany horse and leather notes. This wine smacks down hard on the palate, showing spunky flavors of red fruit and spice. Peppery, dry and wiry as a whole.
Bellezza (100% Sangiovese that ages 16 months in oak) is a modern and succulent wine with a supple feel and very good density. Generous layers of spice, black pepper and wet earth back aromas of black currant and cherry. Drink this wine with stewed meats and potatoes au gratin.
There's no denying this wine's force. It's 15% ABV but balanced, with roasted berry, leather, toasty oak, graphite and prune aromas. The palate feels full, flush and without gaps, while flavors of blackberry, cassis, chocolate and spice finish exceedingly smooth, with loamy notes and leftover spice. Drink through 2020.
Modest on the nose, and then very little after that. The flavors are basic lime and citrus, and the feel is tangy and lemony sharp. Generic, with little to no varietal character.
Leather and tobacco on the nose and a tart, oaky spicy flavor profile make this Finger Lakes Cab a little tough to tame, but paired with a sharp cheese or heartier fare, it will round out nicely. Fruit-forward and assertive; needs time to aerate before drinking.
Big, rich and fruity, this wine has a powerful future. It delivers structure and dense tannins, but it's the generous fruitiness that promises much. The tannins will soften by 2016–2017 to give a ripe, full-bodied wine, packed with fruit.
A delicious blend of 55% Cabernet Franc, 27% Merlot, 17% Cabernet Sauvignon and a dash of Petit Verdot opens with aromas of concentrated black plum, blackberry, blue flowers and a whiff of leather. The juicy palate doles out fleshy black cherries, crushed raspberries, white pepper, clove and grilled herb while velvety tannins provide the framework. A licorice note marks the close.
Definitely on the ripe side, this wine showcases mature aromas of berry jam, raspberry fruit roll-up, tar, licorice and lingering strawberry. Ripe flavors in the mouth are backed by spice, smoke, mineral and velvety consistency. Pair this wine with Cajun blackened meat.
A perfumed village wine, this is made from four different parcels. The wine offers an attractive touch of tannin and spice to go with the forward red fruits. It should develop relatively quickly, and will be ready to drink from 2018.
Although a touch rough and stalky on the nose, any and all gritty aromas are offset by earthy, mature cherry and plum scents. Grabby but fair on the palate, this tastes of roasted plum, herbs and peppery spice. A dry, toasty finish with spice notes ranks as good.
Perfumed berry, fragrant blue flower, cake spice and leather are just some of the alluring scents you find on this firmly structured red. The elegant, full-bodied palate offers red cherry, raspberry, clove, menthol and licorice alongside a backbone of tightly wound but refined tannins and bright acidity. Give this a few more years to fully develop. Drink 2019–2025.
Maybe it's the name, but there does seem to be a hint of saffron in the lovely bouquet. Finesse and complexity are the stated goals of the winery, expressed beautifully here in an elegant mix of black cherry, mocha and coffee flavors. The mouthfeel, texture, and smooth finish make it a pleasure to drink.
This wine, boosted by 8% Syrah, is relatively light in the glass, showing vanilla and plush red cherries on the nose. The palate offers lots of baking spices and touches of dried herbs, but is based primarily on rose petals and ripe olallieberries.
This wine shows ultraripe fruit, with cola and sweet-oak spice wrapped in a plush texture and juicy finish. A simple, user-friendly weeknight glugger.

There's no mistaking the variety, with plentiful aromas of fresh herb and cherry alongside vanilla and light barrel accents. The dark fruit flavors are supple with a mesmerizing texture and an exquisite balance that extends through the coffee-filled finish. The attention to detail throughout is impressive, especially for a wine at this price.
Hmmm. This has plenty of intensity, strident grapefruit flavors and crisp acids, but the aromas are marked by onion or garlic scents that make the wine perplexing to evaluate. From memory, a bottle tasted nonblind seemed much cleaner, so perhaps the sample was just off?
Aromas of freshly cut wood, pickling spices, vanilla dark cherry lead to plentiful black-fruit flavors, supported by lightly astringent tannins. There are good things underneath but the wood gets in the way.
This is firm, with dense fruits and ripe tannins. It has concentration as well as plenty of red fruits. Drink this potentially rich wine from Alliance Bourg from 2018.
This wine has wood acidity more than fruit freshness, but its citrus and apple flavors show potential. Although spice and toast dominate for the moment, a crisper character comes through at the end.
This is a very interesting Pinot Grigio with a unique aromatic profile that includes a green note of chopped herbs or crushed white pepper. There are pretty fruit notes too and the wine is silky and crisp on the close.
Deeply impressive on every level, from the profound, inviting aromas of currants and fine oak to the mouthfeel, which is plush and important. Encased in a superb structure of acidity and firm tannins are ripe, complex flavors of currants, violets, olive tapenade and oatmeal raisin cookies. Completely dry, this beautiful wine should age well for six years or more.
A peppery, aromatic start leads into this tightly-layered, pure varietal, single vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon. It's layered with red berry fruits, from strawberries on through. Young and firm, it shows just the right amount of barrel toast around polished tannins.
This wine astounds in big, juicy waves of jammy cherry, strawberry and forest floor, its fruit sourced from Gap's Crown, Dutton Ranch, Goldrock Ridge and Jenkins vineyards, among other sites. Textured and layered, with powerful force, it shows richness and concentration but also fresh acidity.
Lighter, leaner flavors like cranberry, rhubarb and tart cherry light up this wine from the first sniff through the tangy finish. Balanced on the fresher, crisper side of the spectrum, it has firm tannins, an appetizing dry texture and medium body. The focused fruit flavors and light spicy accents make it distinctive.
Here's a dark, big, rich and bone-dry Syrah. It has deep flavors of blackberries, dark chocolate, currants, spices and cedar. Pretty tannic now, with a closed-astringency that suggests hours of decanting, but it's not an ager.
This showcases lovely, sappy cherry and raspberry flavors that are grounded and given greater interest by a rich, mulchy earthiness and also a slight funkiness—like wild mushrooms pan-sautéed in bacon fat. Alluring and complex, it's a Pinot Noir that will gain traction over the next six years.
Here is a unique white wine with aromas of mature peach, honeydew melon and almond nut. It offers a compact, streamlined texture and medium persistency on the finish.
The color is very pretty, and the wine a bit tight. As it opens up it is surprisingly chewy, leafy and slightly hot at 14.1% alcohol. Perhaps from young vines?
Compelling and sweet-smelling, Archimede offers pretty tones of spice, black cherry, molasses, espresso and cola. The ruby-colored wine is zippy and fresh with soft tannins and medium length in the mouth.

Berry and plum aromas are ripe and woody, with a note of sawdust appearing on the nose. This has zest and zing on the palate, along with creamy weight, while flavors of toast, wood resin and baked blackberries finish smoky and plump.
This Brunello speaks highly of Montalcino wine tradition. A fresh, crisp element is backed by aromas of cassis, bramble and bitter berry. There's a tightness in the mouth as well that needs more time to soften.
Perfumed in cassis and chocolate, this wine starts out with soft layers of fruit, but lacks structure and definition, making for a simple, lighthearted quaff.
Made in an immediately accessible style, this is a softly gentle, silky Pinot Noir with lots of delicious flavor. Brims with cherry pie filling, cola, anise, cinnamon and smoky, spicy sandalwood. Charming now, and complex enough for fine grills and roasts.
Winemaker: Dewaldt Heyns. Dense and concentrated, this leads with scents of black fruit preserves, pepper and crushed purple violets. The palate is smooth and satiny, framed by plush, soft tannins and creamy fruit flavors. It's well balanced and approachable now, with lingering peppery spice on the close. Drink now–2021.
Dusty apple, melon and saline aromas are nice but not too intense or exact. This is tight and juicy but textured on the palate, with nectarine, peach and saline flavors. A round feeling finish offers up minerality and length.

A blend of Grenache Blanc and Viognier, this is attractive, fruity and perfumed. Touches of apricot balance with the green fruits and herbal edge. It's an easy wine to drink, best as an apéritif.
Darker, denser and more raisiny than your average varietal Graciano, this wine is almost pruney and horsey. But it settles down to offer solid but chunky black plum, prune and balsamic flavors. The finish is stocky but not flabby. Meaty and solid for Graciano. Imported by Baron Francois Ltd.
This light, crisp white is the perfect counterpoint to a hot, lazy, summer afternoon. The slightly leafy, green apple and lime scents are a pick-me-up, followed by some delightfully pure and crystalline flavors ranging from rainwater to fresh greens, apple and pears to citrus. Clean and refreshing on the finish.
This balanced, ripe wine shows the richness of the year while offering enough structure for aging. It has weight and concentration, its black fruits an integral part of this dense wine.
Imperial is CVNE's most accessible and affordable top-end Rioja, and what a winner it is in 2010. Cool, toasty aromas show sweet maple and vanilla notes along with berry and cassis scents. Fresh but weighty and elegant, this deals ripe berry and loamy earth flavors in front of a mellow finish that's clean and not too demanding. Drink now through 2022.
Pommard and Dijon clones planted in 2001 fuel this tasty wine. Its dusty plum and black cherry fruit carries a touch of dark chocolate, all framed by firm yet polished tannins. Built to age, it can be enjoyed now with a good decanting.
Coming in a sparkly package befitting its name, this boxed wine shows honeysuckle and pineapple on the nose. On the palate, green apple flesh and pink apple skins prove tart and ripe at the same time, though without tons of body or finish. It's a solid deal though!
This young wine offers aromas of jammy black fruit and spice. The dark chocolate and cherry flavors are pretty and polished, with fine-grained tannins backing them up.
Heavy and definitely on the mealy side of the fence, and fighting for any semblance of balance. Pithy as well. Sadly, the citrus fruit in this wine is not that appealing.
For such a large production Chard, this one gives a lot of concentrated varietal purity. It's dry and crisp, brimming with ripe pineapple, green apple, Key lime pie, pear, date and smoky vanilla flavors that finish with real sophistication and class.
This is a wine that brings out the fine minerality of Dão whites. It is crisp while at the same time full and ripe. There is a smooth texture that comes from the Encruzado in the blend, with lively acidity coming from Gouveio. This wine will benefit from a few months in bottle, so drink from summer 2016.
Sweet on the nose yet firm as a bristle brush, with lime and pineapple as the key aromas. Feels juicy, tight and light on the tongue, with fine acidity propelling nectarine, lime and melon flavors. Zesty, crisp and pure throughout. A serious value among white wines.
Dusty earth tones add savoriness to fresh white peach in this dry, medium-bodied Pinot Gris. Fresh lemon-lime acidity maintains a lively, invigorating feel. Drink now.
Some high-toned volatile aromas highlight this wine. People sensitive to this might find that the pungency takes away from the simple, fruity charm. Drink it chilled for best results.
This shows wonderfully layered, complex flavors, in addition to great structure. Thoroughly dry, with rich, fine tannins, it flatters with red and black currant, red cherry, milk chocolate, licorice, root beer, vanilla, dusty spice and smoky oak flavors. Luscious now and through 2010.
For red wine drinkers seeking an easygoing dessert tipple, this semi-sweet Feteasca is a cheerful candidate with sour cherry fruit flavors darkened by just a hint of bramble. Medium bodied with bright acidity that keeps the palate fresh.
Rich in cassis and black peppercorn, grapes for this wine came from Stagecoach Vineyard as well as other Napa Valley superstar sources. It delivers layers of medium-weight blackberry and currant fruit, developed tannins and a signature taste of dusty minerals and rock. Small amounts of Merlot and Petit Verdot are blended in.
Dry, smooth and tannic, this is a polished wine for drinking now with a salted and peppered steak. Its cherry, tobacco and sandalwood flavors will complement the meat's grilled sweetness.
This was a tough vintage, with multiple days above 100¢ª during harvest, but winemaker John Falcone pulled it off. The wine is graceful despite a background of raisins, which add a spicy piquancy to the cherry and crushed spice flavors. Drink now.
A big, chunky wine that begins with pleasant aromas of dark, lush fruit and rose petals, it cannot sustain its promise on the palate. It starts well enough, but by midpalate, most of the fruit has gone, and the finish is short and a little dour.
Brown-gold in color, with a staunch, ripe bouquet of syrupy peach, apricot and caramel. The palate is rich and full bodied, with peach, apricot and sweet melon flavors. Thick and satisfying on the finish, but still fairly juicy due to good core acidity.
Rather reined-in on the nose, this wine lacks Gewürz's over-the-top aromatics, instead showing restrained pear and spice scents. Combined with the wine's lack of residual sugar, this aspect of the wine will make it more versatile with food, as it pumps out apple, citrus and spice flavors that turn peppery on the finish.
An old-school, non-interventionist style of Pinot Noir with a slightly tawny color on the rim and similarly mature flavors. This has earthy, tea-like aromas, flavors of dried cranberries and a mellow texture.
Subdued violet, plum and brown spice scents lead this 70% Sangiovese, 20% Ciliegiolo and 10% Canaiolo Chianti. Those aromas carry over to the palate, which is simple and mildly tanninic. Drink soon.
Owned by the Vialard family, this is a very fine wine. While it does have strong wood flavors at this young stage, they are going to be there to support the ripe jammy fruit. The wine from this 111-acre estate is generous and is going to age well. Drink from 2022.
Shows lots of new oak in the buttery toast and sweet vanilla char flavors that ride high over the pineapple jam, soft ripe pear and papayas. A clean, creamy Chardonnay for drinking now.
In time, this may surpass the regular bottling, but for now it trails by a nose, thanks to some mushroom, bracken and lima bean scents that dampen the cola and beet flavors. As always, it's big, rich and full-bodied. Try in 2005.
This 100% Cabernet was grown in a Calistoga vineyard. It was aged in 40% new oak. At the age of 3½ years, it's still quite tannic, even a bit rustic, with zippy acidity and fresh, jammy blackberry and black cherry flavors. Hard to say where it's going, but try aging it for 5–6 years and see what happens.
The cool vintage took its toll on this unbalanced wine. Despite enormously high alcohol of 15.6%, it smells vegetal and tastes thin in cherries and asparagus.
Monterey Chards often exhibit this aroma, which makes you think you could pick them out in a blind tasting. The wine smells fresh and juicy, with Key lime pie and tropical fruit notes. In the mouth, it's rich, fruit-forward and oaky. This Chard is designed to dazzle.
A mineral wine that brings an austere character as well as fresh fruit. Apples, pears and lime zest are all there. Attractive, open and ready to drink.
A Blanc de Noirs from Malbec, this aromatic wine has just a hint of tannins from the grape skins along with attractive acidity. It's a surprisingly fresh and fruity wine in the context of Malbec. Drink now.
Earthy blackberry and black-olive aromas set up a saturated, thick palate with grating tannins. Herbal blackberry, toast and coffee flavors reflect time in barrel. It's stout and full of power and fruit on the finish. Drink through 2020.
Aromas of espresso and burnt biscotti entice on this dark yet elegant Cab. On the palate, fresh violets linger amidst layers of ripe black fruit, smoke and char towards a stout, moderately tannic finish. Quite pleasant now, but could improve with 3–5 years of bottle aging.
This showcases the winery's style of ripe fruit, soft texture and considerable oak than it does Mount Veeder's terroir, but nonetheless, it's delicious. Made from 100% Cabernet, it's power-packed with flavors of blackberry and cherry jam, chocolate and vanilla-tinged toast. Drink now–2015.
Waxy on the nose, but more fruity on the palate, where things run full and heavy with chunky pineapple and peach flavors. Finishes with a mix of sweet stickiness but also some pith and bitterness. Seems about average by Chilean standards.
This is the softest of the three single vineyard wines from Château de Fuissé. It has a warm, rich character, generous and full in the mouth. Yellow fruits are partnered with citrus acidity and an attractive layer of wood. The wine ends with the freshness of the vintage.
A terrific Cabernet from this mountain west of Sonoma Valley. Wonderfully ripe and complex in black currant, blackberry, mocha, cedar and spice flavors, its tannins are authoritative, and require some age to resolve. If you drink now, decant, but it should be best after 2010.
Subtitled Vin de Vinarchiste, this is a blended wine from organically grown grapes which include the local Fer and Périgord alongside Bordeaux varieties. It is a crisp wine showing some tight, almost green-pepper flavors as well as smoky acidity. It is young but will be ready to drink soon. Drink from early 2017.
Both the juicy and the tart notes of ripe apple and freshly cut apple peel play on the nose. The palate follows with balanced, gentle sweetness: a play-off between apple ripeness and apple tartness. The notion is crisp and the body generous. The finish is delicate and the wine seems just off dry, although it is a proper late-harvest style. It would be an absolute winner with soft cheeses.
Campovida's Mendocino take on a classic Italian white, this Arneis is floral, balancing its high-wire acidity with standout characteristics of lemon, grapefruit and just-ripe pear. This is a perfect wine to pour with light appetizers or for the first sip of the day.
Young citrus aromas, followed by a palate of creamy apple sauce and pears, light in flavor, but certainly fresh and fruity.
Frothy (beware the cork upon opening), this sparkling Muscat is sweet in jasmine and vanilla that finishes clean and quick.
The Freestone Hill bottling is one of Dutton Goldfield's biggest and most powerful Pinot Noirs, and the '06 is nearly as stunning as the magnificent '05. It just explodes in the mouth with succulent cherry and raspberry pie, mocha and spicy anise and pepper flavors, with fabulous complexities from smoky oak. Terrific now, but the tannins will hold it for a decade.
Scents of oak, toast, bread crust and vanilla follow through to the lean palate along with bitter walnut and a hint of butterscotch. Sharp, vigorous bubbles provide the backdrop.
Size isn't everything, but in this magnificent 100% Cab, it's an impressive part of the total package. The blackcurrant and cherry flavors are massive, the oak is impressively strong and spicy, the acidity is balancing, and the tannins are a wonder, softly ripe and firm at the same time. On the finish, the flavors turn even richer, suggesting crème de cassis and chocolate. Best now–2010.
Winemaker Rob Newsom has defined a Chardonnay style that pushes the grape to its ripening limits. Straw gold and bursting with ultraripe scents and flavors, it's a jumble of apples, orange marmalade, and lemon candy. A buttery finish brings olive oil, caramel and butterscotch.
Minty, leathery berry fruit aromas are herbal and foresty. This is flush and solid in feel, with controlled tannins. Roasted, herbal black plum and berry flavors are what you'd expect from Colchagua Valley Carmenère, while this feels meaty and tastes blackened on the finish.
This is for those who like their Gewurztraminer super-spicy, decadent even. It's total spice without much in the way of fruit, and so makes a statement. Drink now.
Husband-wife team David Paige and Barbara Shinn upped the reserve bottling from six to nine barrels, but they've still managed to increase the quality with help from a good vintage. Cinnamon graham cracker coats cherry and blueberry aromas, leading to a solid core of blueberry and eraser flavors. Secondary flavors of mushroom, normal for North Fork Merlot, and wood segue into a lovely finish of spice, cherry and mineral. A smooth wine, and easily drinkable now. It will only get better with a little age.
Dark and forceful, with an earthy nose of tar, leather and baked fruit. The palate has life and size, but also quasi-sharp acidity, while flavors of blackberry carry a lactic, vanilla undertone. Finishes sweet but a little burnt.
The blend is almost equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec and Cabernet Franc, with some Carmenet and Petit Verdot blended in for complexity. The wine is easy to like now for its dryness and elegance, despite relatively high alcohol. It shows California ripeness of fruit, with a smooth integration of oak. If there's a criticism, it's excessive softness. Drink up.
While the nose suggests a hint of pressed apple, the palate on this richly textured Chardonnay is bright with yellow plum and apple flavors touched with spice, smoke and cream. Revitalizing acidity freshens the midpalate, leaving the finish brisk and clean.
The longer this wine breathes in the glass the better it gets. At first sip, it's obviously a very good wine, richly tannic and deeply impressive in blackberries, cassis and oak, with a firm minerality that grounds it. But as it warms and airs, the fascinating palate begins to unfold. Will age effortless for many years. Drink now–2020.
A bit cloudy and still tasting as if it came right out of the new French barrels in which it was fermented, this offers a rich and diverse texture and highlights of lemon oil, beeswax and Aplets & Cotlets. There's a lot going on here, in a blocky chunky, fruity style.
The nose gives little away but the palate is full of juicy, apple-scented freshness. This wine is easy and dry, with some midpalate concentration. The unusually slender body has a refreshing spring.
A grilled steak will play nicely against the tannins and acids of this Syrah, grown in the cool Carneros district north of San Francisco. The black peppercorn and blackberry flavors suggest a butter-enriched wine reduction sauce. Best now and for a couple years.
A nice mouthful of Syrah, rich and full-bodied. Drinks dry and rather tannic, with plummy, blackberry, peppery flavors. But it's very complex. If you use your imagination, you can find anise, white chocolate, bacon, and all sorts of other things. Dry, rich, and long in the finish, a distinctive wine that pushes the reputation of this valley for Syrah.
If you like your Sauvignon Blanc herbal, then this is the wine for you. It's very fruity and New World in style, has tight acidity and is ready to drink.
Sulfur shrouds this wine at first, but it dissipates with time to reveal mild notes of honeyed nut, kiwi, white flower and golden apple. The palate has balanced acidity and a slight oiliness, and the flavors seem a bit muted at the moment.
This is a distinctive wine from Puglia with deep layers of blackberry jam, ash, slate roof, allspice and ground ginger. It has firm tannins and thick density that could stand up to succulent cuts of beef.
It's hard to believe it's possible to buy this quality rosé for so little money. Mouthwatering scents of raspberry, stone fruit and crushed stone emerge from the glass, followed by rich, ripe fruit flavors balanced by just-enough citrusy acidity. It's full-bodied and plush, yet vibrant and long on the finish.
This is no longer in its prime. It tastes weird, mealy and slightly exotic, while the palate feels rubbery. Nectarine and plum notes are detectable on a strained finish.
Thanks to the firm and structured nature of the tannins, Montepergoli will benefit from another five years of cellar aging. The wine opens with black, ripe fruit and smoky aromas of tanned leather, clove and peppercorn.
Rich and borderline syrupy, but restrained enough to keep its focus. The mouth deals brawny red and black fruit encased in meaty tannins. And with some oak-based mocha and coffee on the finish, it is solid as a rock.
Surprisingly, given that this is the reserve-level red wine in the lineup, it seemed to further accent the herbal nature of the grapes, veering into vegetal. Chewy, sour and rather dull, it's best consumed in the near term.
Rich, firm, opulent and impressive. With this vintage, the wood element seems to have tamed and integrated, leaving an attractive edge of chocolate and coffee.
This has intense forest-floor aromas, a hint of violet along and toasted oak and vanilla notes. The palate shows bright raspberry and espresso flavors, nervous acidity and firm tannins. It needs time, so drink after 2016.
This small cooperative, based in Mardeuil, always seems to punch above its station, thanks to good quality fruit. This rosé is the same—a freshly crisp wine that has good depth of flavor and great aromas of red berry fruits. Delicious. Not available in the U.S.
While the wine is rich and fruity, it also a cool, crisp edge that comes from the nearby ocean. Red-berry fruits are shot through with acidity and a dry core of tannin. The pepper and spice flavor probably comes from the high alcohol.
This is an approachable version of the slightly wild and dry red Meoru grape of South Korea. Spicy and bright on the nose, the wine follows with vibrant fruit flavors that are a touch pointed when not paired with food. A great way to explore a lesser-known wine-producing region.
A solid value, this off-dry Riesling features classic scents of lime sherbet, followed by hints of lime, Granny Smith apple and fresh greens. It's light in body, finishing on a refreshing tart yet sweet note.
Shows the Farrell mark of elegance, with balanced ripeness and acidity. Bigtime flavors of pineapples and tangerines mingle with caramelized oak, with additional buttered toast and vanilla richness. A crowd-pleasing Chardonnay that shouldn't be consumed too cold.
Acidity, minerals and lower alcohol combine to make Gordon's '08 far superior to the 2007. There's a bracing steeliness to the pineapple and green apple fruit, which is cleansed with racy acidity. The oak is a little strong, but this is a lovely, complex Carneros Chardonnay to drink now.
This is a neutral, papery white wine, with a flat, rather than lively mouthfeel. The apple flavored fruit is there, along with a touch of licorice, but the freshness seems to have been lost along the way.
This oxidized expression of Sauvignon shows an off-gold color, with aromas of apricot and butterscotch. It tastes flat and broad on the palate.
Packed with grapey, plummy fruit, smoke and vanilla, this is solid entry-level stuff. It's not particularly rich or concentrated, but it is something that's uncommon at this price: balanced. That makes it an attractive by-the-glass option or barbecue companion. —J.C.
A very likeable Cabernet Sauvignon, easily up there with the best of Easton's Cabs. The wine is dry and rich in fruit, with finely ground tannins housing ripe blackberry and black currant flavors. Should develop in the bottle over the next 2–4 years.
Lush and lovely, this sweet treat is an outstanding example of the variety made as an icewine. Loaded with apricot, tangerine, peach and honey, it compensates for its sweetness with balancing acidity. One 375 ml bottle will easily serve four for dessert.
This wine is rich, still young and with a great presence. It layers yellow fruits and orange peel with a soft structure that masks the full-bodied nature of the wine. It is warm, not yet ready. Keep until 2016.
This is a beautiful Bordeaux blend, offering the kind of classic poise and exotic flair that South Africans are so good at delivering. On the nose, soft mint, chocolate, cedar and black currant beckon, and on the palate, spice and minerality mingle with the earthier elements. The structure is good, and there's ample complexity, but the wine is still approachable.
This crisp and snappy wine shows varietal characteristics of stone fruit, cut grass and pear, backed by a full and generous mouthfeel that speaks of the warm Tuscan sun. Pair this with assorted Chinese dim sum.
While demure and mineral at first whiff, this revitalizing Riesling blossoms on the nose as it aerates, accumulating layers of citrus and floral aromas. Off-dry in style, it boasts ripe yellow-cherry flavor streaked with lime-juice acidity.
Two Oceans offers a friendly, vibrant sip with this Sauvignon Blanc. Tropical fruit, gooseberry, some straw on the nose and simple, fresh citrus and fleshy tropical fruit flavors give the wine complexity. A fun white with some heft.
On the rich side, this is a full-bodied and forward. It's concentrated and spicy, and with its weight it is a food-friendly wine.
Jasmine and fresh-cut pineapple scents lead the way to tropical fruit flavors of guava and mango and a soft finish.
There's a whiff of summer—ripe yellow peaches caramelizing on the grill—trapped between the many layers of this honeyed, off-dry Riesling. The palate is polished with an undertone of wet stones and notes of freesia and grapefruit zest. Brisk acidity and a long, minerally finish round out this cheerful yet focused wine.
Rather raw and sharp, a young wine with carbonic tastes of jammy fruit and berries. It's smooth in tannins, and an easy sipper.
This is an earthy, minty, tart and taut wine, worthy of its appellation. It offers light-bodied notions of black tea, cranberry and rhubarb.
Dense and warm, with an aroma package of raisin and roasted black fruits. The wine smacks your cheeks with ripe tannins and full fruit, and the flavors of roasted berries carry some bitterness on the back end. Chewy, rich and good, with an elevated character.
The winery's top rosé is a Chardonnay-Pinot Noir blend. It shows equal parts limes, pears, strawberries and raspberries, reflecting its parentage. What lifts it to greatness is the structure, so refined and creamy, rich in acidity, with a yeasty bitterness. It has that hard to define quality of finesse that makes it gorgeous to drink now with the finest foods.
Soft and supple on the palate, this impressive wine is lightly spiced with dust and clove, its tannins rounded and in support of lingering cassis and red cherry flavors. Mocha and tobacco lend additional depth and complexity as it unfolds, punctuated by juicy acidity.
Medium-bodied, with what appears to be a touch of residual sugar to help round it out, this fresh, apple-y Riesling also features hints of orange blossom and florists' greens.
Shows some nicely ripened pear and peach flavors that are enriched with sweet vanillins and toasty oak and a hit of yeasty lees. A firm spine of acidity provides cleanliness and balance to this tasty Chard.
White summer blossoms and ripe green pears make for a fresh scent. The palate lifts these notions with bright lemon acidity. All is buoyed by some residual carbon dioxide. Drink soon while this is at its aromatic height.
This crisp and stylish Chardonnay could serve as a poster child for Washington, with its emphasis on the fruit, not the barrel, and modest ripeness that accents green apple and gooseberry flavors, with a little brioche in the finish. Scented with apple blossoms and lemon oil, this style brings out the intensity of the fruit, and enhances the capacity of the wine to cleanse your palate, leaving you refreshed and ready for food.
Here's a brisk, bright and very flavorful Chardonnay for drinking with rich fare, like crab, pork, scallops or chicken in a buttery cream sauce. It's strong in acidity, with honeyed, creamy flavors of kiwi fruit, limes, pineapples and vanilla.
Another fine version of this wine, with its intensely flavorful notes of tart green apples, citrus fruits, and figs. Acids are bright and crisp and the wine is fully dry, with an appealingly bitter finish that cries out for food.
A gently floral nose gives rise to a charming and soft palate. Fresh pear buried in mounds of white petals on the nose leads to a distinct, ultraclean and dry palate. Despite its alluring, aromatic softness it has complete focus. The finish offers pure lemon.
Strong wood aromas follow through to the wood-dominated palate. The juiciness comes from wood as much as from the ripe apricot fruits. It's a wine that needs to integrate better, hopefully from 2015.
This spent 18 months in French oak and three years in bottle, ahead of an April 2016 release. Light and elegant, it carries a whiff and taste of leather, with earthy, slightly grainy tannins. With air, the strawberry fruit gains some flesh. Decant it and drink now through 2018.
Very much in the same vein as the '02, this is a wine intense and concentrated with blackberry jam and coffee flavors. It finishes dry, with some fairly hefty tannins and shows a ruggedness that could soften with bottle age.
With pure black-fruit aromas, modest minerality and violet scents, the bouquet is right on target. In the mouth, this is saturated and wide, with smooth tannins. Earthy flavors of blackberry, licorice and baking spices finish solid and toasty. This fits the bill and then some; drink through 2018.
Aromas of leafy underbrush, moist soil, dark berry and new leather lead the way. The firm polished palate doles out ripe morello cherry, licorice, chopped herb and a hint of coffee while youthfully assertive, fine-grained tannins provide the framework.
Subtle scents of white flower and peanut shell meld with core aromas of tropical fruits. The palate feels viscous and open knit, and the residual sugar makes for a clingy finish.
Fragrant and floral, this bright wine would pair well with fried seafood or baked Mediterranean fish. Honey and peach blossom notes lead to a crisp, easy mouthfeel.
The Roserock cuvée is notably dark and concentrated, with loads of ripe black cherry fruit. The nose is spicy, and flavors are saturated with luscious mocha. This is a fine example of the vintage, ready to enjoy immediately.
This blend of 40% Mourvèdre, 25% Grenache, 23% Syrah, 9% Cinsault and 3% Counoise offers boysenberry, hot bricks and condensed violets on the nose. The palate is quite pleasant with olallieberry jam flavors alongside sanguine elements and dark slate on the edges, altogether quite light and easy to drink.
Broad aromas of seared lemons, white peach and nectarine are given nuance with a bit of quinine on this entry-level bottling. Stewed lemons and apple-custard flavors show on the plush and pillowy palate, cut with an acidic sizzle.
A lightly perfumed wine, this is fruity with peppered lemon and melon flavors. It has a crisp edge and finishes with bright acidity.
Virtú is the winery's white blend, this vintage partnering 56% Sémillon with 44% Sauvignon Blanc. The combination is explosive, briny and flowery in the best ways, a taste of apple and fresh-squeezed lime vibrant on the palate, followed by savory herb and a nuanced taste of toasty oak. The aroma conveys a sense of fresh salt air.
A real oddball that's musky, melony, sweet and–yes–bubbly. Vidal is a French-American hybrid with some strange petrolly aromatics that take some getting used to, and they're well-displayed in this example that gets its bubbles from fermentation in sealed tanks, trapping the naturally occurring carbon dioxide.
A blend of Grenache and Cinsault, this wine comes from old vines in an estate revived in 1997 by Gilles Pons and Pascale Massenot. It's all about aromatic fruit, with grapefruit, pineapple and red currants playing in the flavors. A rich element contrasts pleasurably with the tight, crisp acidity. The wine will benefit from a few more months aging, so wait until the end of 2016.
Sturdy black cherry and cola notes anchor this fairly priced offering from Marlborough. It's a bit chunky, without Pinot's classic silky mouthfeel, but solid and dependable, picking up some menthol notes on the finish.
Bright and lemony on the nose with freshly cut grass and a hint of melon rind, this dry white wine is a blend of Chardonnay, Ugni Blanc and Muscat. It's not very complex, but fresh apples and pear flavors and a nice, luscious mouthfeel makes this Lebanese wine a quaffable choice.
Everything about this dry, voluptuous Riesling is intense and penetrating. The palate is concentrated with stonefruit and yellow flower notes, and bristling with lemon-lime acidity. Rich layers of crushed stone and mineral oil linger deliciously on the finish.
Vibrant aromas of rose petals, stone fruit, pastry and smoke captivate throughout this multifaceted Riesling. Semidry in style, the palate apposes sweet flavors of honey and caramel against crisp peaches and tangerine. The lingering finish is marked by a flurry of blossoms and astringent tea notes.
Full of yellow fruits, ripe apples and soft acidity, this is a rich wine with hints of spice and also attractive, perfumed acidity. It has a tangy, zesty character that is attractive and refreshing. Drink from 2017.
There is just a touch of wood here, adding spice to the warm tropical-fruit flavors. It's round, with hints of pepper and rich melon and peach.
Prunotto tends to exemplify a ripe, almost jammy style of Barolo with succulent cherry and smoked meat characteristics followed by vanilla, cinnamon, mineral, blackberry and licorice. The intensity is wonderful here but the wine still needs a few extra aging years in the bottle to relax those young tannins.
Simple, with mild vegetal aromas, hints of tobacco and lean red fruit. Typical beet and bramble define the palate, with is textured if not overly flavorful. Finishes dark and smoky, with a shock of green.
Powerful tannins are the hallmark of this dense wine, hardly surprising considering the blending of Malbec and Tannat. The wine also has the concentrated fruit to go with the structure, with its black plum and dark berry flavors. Structure and fleshy fruit are coming together well, just needing time. Drink from 2018.
This jammy, fruity offering tastes as though it were made from overripe fruit. Its light structure offers acidity and a Port-like character. Not for aging.
This well-balanced wine is both fruity and structured. It has good acidity, blackberry juice flavors and a bright aftertaste. It can be drunk now–2018.
An impressive single varietal wine, this shows notes of spice, black currant and wood, along with dark tannins and a firm, dry core. With its acidity and tannins, this will likely age over several years.
This is a blend from Aÿ on the Montagne de Reims and from the Côte des Blancs. It is intensely perfumed, with weight from Pinot Noir and crispness from Chardonnay. If it seems not quite integrated at this stage, it will hopefully come together over the next few years to reveal a ripe and rich wine. Drink from 2017.
This wine has a pale orange color, apricot aromas, and jazzy peach and citrus flavors that are lively and fresh. It's nearly dry (1.5% dosage), and done in a sophisticated style, with fine-textured bubbles and a clean finish.
Very limited, this is a relatively new project from second generation winemaker Jason Lett. It is sourced from “the oldest vines in the Willamette Valley”—presumably Eyrie vines planted in 1965, and finds similar territory as the Eyrie reserve, with a bit more richness through the midpalate, partly from more expressive barrel flavors.
Smells funky, with forest floor, humus and mushroom aromas mingling with riper scents of wild berries and sweet oak. The fruity flavors are well developed, and drink sweetlyripe, yet the wine has a one-dimensionality and is excessively soft. —S.H.
Unusual aromas of creamed corn and exotic notes are too unfamiliar to register properly. It's thick but not entirely cloying, with powdered sugar and dried mango flavors. Weird stuff that probably won't find too many takers.
The letters stand for Odd Man Out, perhaps a reference to the unusual blend (two thirds Petit Verdot, one third Malbec). The nose promises and the mouth delivers a lot of leathery barnyard character; some tasters call it a feature, and some call it a flaw. Black cherry fruit, thick and chewy tannins, and alcohol near 15% mark this as a powerful wine. Drink soon.
With 4,300 bottles produced and only 110 cases imported, this is a gorgeous small production Cab that should be grabbed up when you find it. It's all dark fruit and sweet spice with notes of black currant, fig, plum, leather and cigar box. With firm tannins and a medium-full weight, this is a big but balanced wine that's easy to enjoy now or can be cellared for a couple of years.
The winery follow up a string of very good Pinots from this vineyard with another solid hit. The wine is dry, silky, medium-bodied and delicious, offering an array of raspberry jam, cherry pie, cola and vanilla-oak flavors. The acidity is pronounced and just fine. Good now, and should develop interesting nuances over the next six years.
A big, dark wine, with deep flavors of red and black stone fruits, and wild blackberries. Despite the size, it's a simple wine, easy to understand—it's a ribs-and-barbecued-chicken wine. A Bordeaux-style blend, but with 36% Howell Mountain Zinfandel.
The wine has a rustic character that contrasts with the ripe tannins and red berry fruits. At three years, the wine is ready to drink with structure and fruitiness shadowed by the earthy aftertaste.
This Amarone has nearly overripe aromas, with hints of nail varnish and raisin. The palate is better, offering spirit-soaked black cherry, black pepper and licorice notes. You'll also notice the warmth of alcohol on the midpalate.
Floral cherry aromas are spunky and light, with nothing aggressive. Juicy in the mouth, this Garnatxa delivers some pop but isn't heavy. Cherry, plum and raspberry flavors end minerally and clean, with a drawing feel.
This is a full-throttle, Cabernet Sauvignon-based, Bordeaux-style blend, all from estate-grown grapes. It is huge in velvety texture, though moderate acidity props up the boldness of the blackberry jam and meaty characteristics, all dotted with black-pepper accents.
A nice, easy blush wine, slightly sweet and balanced in acidity. It offers pleasant flavors of raspberry and strawberry candy, vanilla and cinnamon.
A full-throttle effort, with big flavor swashes of blackberry, cassis, black pepper, coffee grounds and ripe tannins. This is Cold Creek Merlot at its most powerful; the 35-year-old vines are in their prime and the flavors show it. Few American Merlots—indeed few in the world—can stand on their own and deliver a wine this complete and powerful. It needs more years to knit together, but no worries—this is a 20-year wine.
Here's a beautifully ruby-colored wine with a sunny disposition and rich aromas of cherry, red flowers, almonds and minerals that is aged six months in French oak. The wine is smooth and silky but has enough acidity to make it a match for pasta and most meat dishes.
From a 15-acre property to the east end of Bergerac, this is a ripe, rounded and smooth wine. It has attractive signs of its wood aging, giving a polished feel to the ripe tannins and red berry fruits. It is ready to drink, but will age until 2020.
Very dark in the glass, this is a blend of 86% Syrah and 14% Petit Verdot. Distinct brandy, cognac, cherry cough syrup and chocolate-balsamic reduction sauce notes characterize the nose. The wine coats the mouth with a viscous density and heavy weight, offering deep flavors of blueberry extract, scotch and vanilla extract. It would work as a dessert wine.
This beautiful wine opens with aromas of ripe dark berry, scorched earth, mint, menthol and a balsamic note. The vibrant palate boasts juicy red cherry, black raspberry, sweet pipe tobacco, baking spice, grilled herb and a hint of game. It's still young and nervous, with tightly wound but refined tannins and firm acidity. Give it time to fully develop. Drink 2020–2031.
This wine takes time to come around, but once it does, oak and pencil shavings season an herbal core that's tight and classic. Black licorice and espresso enter the fray, expanding on the palate's blackberry and cassis. Cellar through 2020–2022.
Proud and distinctive, This Aglianico del Vulture has intense notes of exotic spice and freshly milled peppercorn behind aromas of blackberry and prunes. The aromas penetrate deep at the back of the nose and the dark fruit flavors are succulent, rich and make your mouth pucker. This is a big wine on so many levels. A Marc de Grazia selection, various American importers.
Jasmine and summer blossom hover over ripe, aromatic aspects suggesting melon or quince that shine with power on the dry, streamlined and taut palate. The freshness is immense in this precise, bracing and charming wine.
Bright, cheery whiffs of sugar cookie crumbs and Meyer lemon zest perfume this sunny off-dry Riesling. On the palate, sweet-tart tangerine mingles into more savory notes of bees wax and pollen. The finish is brisk but refreshing.
This fragrant Chardonnay presents bright fruit aromas of mango, pineapple and peach usually associated with the variety. There are some nutty almond notes at the back that give it softness and endurance but they don't interfere with the wine's overall freshness.
Rusty in color and overdone on the nose, this Pinot smells charred and burnt out. Rough and abrasive in feel, with weedy herbal berry flavors, this tastes roasted and savory on the finish while leaving a lot to be desired.
Lovely aromatics mix floral, fruit and barrel components in equal proportion. The wine has some solid tannins, and sits in the mouth with a bit of gravitas. Wild cherry, raspberry, fresh herb, and a little stiffness to the finish. Definitely a wine to age a few more years.

Even if you don't mind high alcohol in a Zinfandel, you might find yourself reacting to this one. It's frankly hot, with a chili pepper burn to the berry fruit. It's also overripe, with a sweet, Porty taste.
Hot in high alcohol, which gives a burn that accentuates the pepper spice and makes it fierce. Yet it's fully dry and rich in blackberry, blueberry, anise and tobacco flavors. Defines the California superripe Zinfandel style.
This is a solid effort in a very difficult vintage. A freeze took out a lot of Washington grapevines in 2004, and it probably impacted the quality of the fruit available for this budget blend. The 2004 carries far more of the green bean and herbal qualities than recent vintages, but the tannins are softened and for the price it seems honest and well-made.

Faint lemon freshness is all that emanates from the earthy nose and palate. This wine is fresh and clean, with notions of lemon and ripe, juicy pear that make an occasional appearance. Drink as soon as possible as a light apéritif.
Mature winter apple, oatmeal and the intricate aromas of dark pine honey give a complex, rich nose to this crémant. The honeyed notes become more pronounced with air and create a thrilling counterpoint to the streak of lemony freshness that pervades the palate. The mousse is integrated, fine and soft while the autolysis lends layers of brioche, oatmeal, earth and yeast. It has backbone, character and a beautifully long finish.
Soft, rich and sweet, this is an easy Merlot for drinking now. It has ripe, forward cherry, mocha and oak flavors, with a hint of bacon that suggests pairing with pork-based entrées.

Aurielle's Cabernets have been consistent over the years, offering lots of ripe, modern-style blackberry, blueberry, dark chocolate and oak flavors in a wine that's drinkable now. This '08 is quite stylish and elegant despite the power, with near-perfect tannins. You could age it, but it's really best enjoyed for flashy, youthful richness.
Poggio Antico is one of the brightest stars in 2004 Brunello di Montalcino. Paola Gloder and her team deliver a gorgeous wine that reaches to the highest levels of aromatic richness and intensity. The wine is succulent, concentrated and elegant with amazing persistency. Only the slight sourness of its tannins prevented it from scoring higher. Age five more years.
A very fruity wine with toast and maturity. It also has a creamy texture, but the finish is spoiled by some unbalanced sweetness. Imported by Moët Hennessy USA.

Light-bodied and ample in cherry, vanilla and smoky flavors, this wine finishes with a suggestion of cinnamon sugar. Soft with silky tannins.
Smells like honey and talc powder, and shows Viognier's typical floral quality most in the mouth. It has the straw/hay quality that I associate more with Semillon, and a  flourlike feel. Less weighty than you expect a Viognier to be, too, but shows how nice the variety can be when made with a lighter hand. Imported by Negociants USA, Inc.

Among an excellent trio of Chardonnays from Roco, this is the spicy one, with soft and supple tree fruits, a touch of citrus and more. The complexities pile on, suggestions of melon and cotton candy, and that lovely sweet spice.
This is the most elegant of the winery's new Zinfandels, although elegant has to be taken in context when it comes to mountain fruit with this intensity and power. It's a big wine, with potent raspberry, cherry and blackberry fruit. Yet there's a delicacy to it, even considering the tannins, that's almost like a Pinot Noir, strange as that sounds. Earns its high score by virtue of this magic. Should age effortlessly throughout the decade.
This is the first vintage of the joint venture between Remhoogte owner Murray Boustred and consultant Michel Rolland. And it certainly started with a bang, exploding in the mouth with intense packed fruit flavors, big spicy wood and juicy, ripe tannins.
This barrel-fermented Chardonnay, from the oldest plantings (1972) in Washington State, displays exceptional concentration and palate weight. Apple pie, pear tart, baking spice, butter and caramel flavors abound. It's rich and packed with fruit, along with the seductive flavors that aging in new French oak can provide.
Lalande de Pomerol is the northern extension of Pomerol, so it's no surprise to find this wine dominated by Merlot. It is soft, rounded and rich. Black plums give the fruitiness while black fruit skins provide the texture. It's a full wine that needs a little aging. Drink from 2016.

From a new winery that's bottle-aging its wines prior to release, this is a blend of 80% Grenache and 20% Syrah.

The wood aging gives a smooth patina over ripe, generous, tropical fruit. To keep it all together, there is acidity and a fresh lift of citrus at the end.

Opens with very attractive and complex aromas of white peach, apricot and smoke. The tremendous flavors show layers of fruit and spice that just roll off the palate. Still, this Rhone blend of Marsanne, Viognier, and Roussanne is quite dry, with terrific structure and intricate detail. Editors' Choice.
Violet in color, with burnt rubber, cherry and plum on the lively nose. Things go south from there, however, as the palate is too snappy and austere to support the flavors. It's 90% Carignan and much like a tart Italian Dolcetto. Imported by Hand Picked Selections.
A rich and concentrated, yellow fruit-dominated wine. This is white Burgundy at its most opulent, dense and generous. The wood is sweet, reinforcing the delicious character of this wine. Age for 4–5 years.

Nothing special about this blend of Tempranillo and Shiraz. In fact, it's more austere and less pleasing than the brand's basic 2007 Temp-Shiraz blend. That said, this wine shows thin raspberry flavors and a tangy, almost sour back end. Probably best with food; not real good on its own.

The biggest, richest, ripest, oakiest of Schug's current trio of Pinots, this wine is gigantic in fruit. It's not quite stewed, but almost, with flavors of sweet tobacco and dried cherries that have been plumped. A little heavy, it may gain elegance with a year or so of bottle age.

The Thanisch wines from the Doctor vineyard rarely stand out in our magazine's blind tastings, making their value proposition questionable. That said, this is a finely elegant wine, with floral details on the nose and enduring stony notes on the finish that mark it as something special. At only 7.5% abv, you'd expect an intensely sweet wine, but the sugars are amply buffered by acids and minerality, so the overall impression is one of richness without excessive weight rather than sugary sweetness.

The perfumed, otherworldly scent of blood orange works its charm on the nose of this lovely wine.

The palate is streamlined and fresh, hinting constantly at this world of flavor, if you only give in to it—so moreish, so long.
Chalky notes of baking soda meet with a nice sizzle of scratched lemon skin, slight bubble gum, fresh sourdough bread and pear blossom on the slightly yeasty nose. Tight lime skins, Asian pear flesh and pink grapefruit cling to a center line of texture and acidity.

Try as a refreshing alternative to tart wines, like Sauvignon Blanc or Pinot Grigio.

This wine is clearly shooting for the modern style of Rioja; it's dark as night, soft and meaty. But it also has a lot of gaseous sulfur on the nose and hard tannins. Expect a chewy, broad Rioja that's hedonistic but on the cusp of overripe. Decant before drinking within the next two years.
This Syrah is so good, it makes you wonder if the Chalone appellation isn't more Rhône than Burgundy. The vines were incredibly low-yielding, giving only 1.2 tons to the acre, and the flavors are intensely concentrated in cassis, black cherry, blueberry jam and vanilla mocha. Soft and gentle, the wine seems best now for its voluptuous fruit.
Opens handsomely with green apple, smoke, and herb aromas. The oak shows in the palate's toast and butterscotch sheen. Slightly viscous on the tongue, with a long minerally finish, this is elegant, taut Chardonnay. Rewarding now, and will improve further.

Plump and sweet, but reasonably balanced, with a dash of CO2 for extra zest, this vintage of Peg Bay's Riesling seems just a touch behind their previous few releases.

Made from 70% Zinfandel, 17% Petite Sirah and 3% Alicante Bouschet, this is bocce-court wine, a nod to Sonoma County's vinous heritage that opens in forested notes and dried plum, blueberry and a hint of pine. Plush and full bodied, it holds on to its tannins without completely giving in to them.

Time and airing help the wine plenty, and sooner rather than later it shows typical Rioja dried red fruits, earth, tobacco and spice.

Not the best Sierra Cantabria high-end wine I've tried but still shows excellence once it finds its stride. Drink from 2015–2025.
This may not be as long-lived as its Matés's Vineyard stablemate, but is it ever luscious now. Toasty, mealy aromas carry hints of roasted nuts, but this flamboyantly oaky wine features fruit to spare, adding layers of apple and citrus flavors that round out the wine without becoming soft or flabby. Drink now. Imported by Wilson Daniels Ltd.

Ruby-pink in color, with sweet aromas of cotton candy but also cherry, raspberry and strawberry. This is a departure from previous vintages of Cherub, which were drier and paler in color. This is more wild and ripe, but it's nicely textured and full-bodied as rosés go. Very good for Chile, but we like our rosés a little more subtle and less sweet.
This is a tight, monstrous Syrah, with a pocket of black fruit flavor and a dollop of earthiness. It veers into raisiny territory on the finish.

Building structure and power as it opens in the glass, it finishes strongly tannic, suggesting more time in the cellar may be of benefit; hold through 2023.
Nothing fancy about this dry, plummy wine, but it gets the job done. Shows ripe currant, tobacco and herb flavors wrapped into firm tannins.
This is a ripe concentrated wine with attractive smoky tannins as well as fresh acidity. It is perfumed with black-currant fruits that are laced with the dry structure as well as acidity. With a year or two more in bottle, this will be a finely balanced wine. Drink from 2019.
Dominated by green-fruit aromas and also green veggies, for example bell pepper and asparagus. The body is pretty good and the acid level keeps it kicking, while the flavors run toward vegetal, just like the bouquet. Finishes with a final dose of green beans and capsicum. Seems to be fading.
Maturity gives a bruised apple aroma to the generous mellowness of ripe pear on the nose.

This one-note Cabernet is overoaked and weakly constituted. A balsam wood note drives the notes and palate, start to finish.

You can almost tell from the look that this is dense and heavy. It has a huge bouquet of wet earth, spice and oak, but not much fruit.

The result is a black cherry- and cassis-scented wine that also shows plenty of cedar and tobacco character. Finishes with some crisp acids that impart an edgy character to the otherwise soft tannins.
Smells like cherry sucking candy and immature red fruit. Very colorful and bold, with sharp flavors and a jumpy mouthfeel. Limited in what it has to offer. Imported by Wine Source Selections.
There's a hint of cherry in the mid-palate, and the wine delivers simple pleasures. Nothing fancy, but nothing wrong.
89-91 Barrel sample. Tight tannins, a firm, solid Saint-Estèphe. There are black plum skins, dense fruit, and dark tannins which run right across the wine.
This attractive Brunello presents a wild, brambly side, with aromas of wild mushroom, forest floor, small berry and crème de cassis. It boasts a beautiful, deep color and plenty of concentration, with endnotes of spice, leather and dried tobacco leaf. The mouthfeel is solid, well defined and superbly structured.
A 70-30 blend of Marsanne and Viognier, the Alliance is an interesting wine but is not one with a lot of concentrated flavor and verve. Offers aromas of wheat cracker and sour apple candy, and flavors of peach, flowers and olive oil. Smooth and slightly oily on the palate; its texture thickens on the finish. 500 cases produced.
There is not a great deal of dolcetto grown in the Northwest, but this is the best version I've yet seen. Its vivid, spicy fruit core expresses the soil, the plant and the grape in equal proportion. Sappy flavors of spiced plum and wild berry hold the fort; it's built like a race car, sleek and stylish, with a powerful, tannic frame.
The sweetest Aszú wine, with 217 grams per liter of sugar (only pure Essencia is sweeter). Honeyed nuts, brown sugar, orange blossom and chocolate aromas waft from the glass. Full and viscous in the mouth, this balanced wine, with a modest 8.5% alcohol, has beautiful flavors of toffee, caramel and orange tea. Finishes long and complex. Imported by Wilson Daniels Ltd.
One of the most instantly delicious Pinots of the vintage. Comes from the northern, warmer part of the valley, and shows perfectly ripe fruit flavors of cherries, cranberries and Dr. Pepper, made richer with sweet smoky oak. Should hold in the bottle for 4–5 years.
Big and dark, with smoked meat and bacon aromas sitting side by side with damp, soupy notes. Has its strong points, such as the dark plum and bacon flavors and the wideness of the finish. Strikes against include extra hard tannins that result in a scouring, lasting feel. Imported by Ecosur Group, LLC.

This seamless, tempting wine combines a hearty 15% Petit Verdot with the Cab. Thick and dense, it imparts memorable flavors of Dr Pepper, black leather, cigar and plenty of berry, currant and plum.
Braucol, hardly found outside Gaillac, produces a deep, dark-colored wine. This powerful wine is rich, smooth and still very young. It is packed to the limits with dark tannins and flavors of its wood aging. Drink from 2017.
Earthy, mature, beefy flavors lend an unorthodox but tasty personality, while medium body and light tannins form an appetizing mouthfeel. This variety is known for its earthy, wild character, so enjoy it!
Aromas of balsam wood, dry spice, berries and vanilla are attractive and inviting. It feels lush and deep, with good layering and robust flavors of berry fruit, spice, herb and tobacco. Flush and slightly herbal tasting on the back end, this is a complex, quality blend of Malbec, Cabernet, Merlot and Syrah.
Apple, mineral and mild briny aromas are complex and interesting. Firm in body, with cutting acidity, this brut nature is bone dry, with white stone-fruit flavors that lean towards neutral except for a hint of salt. Minerality and cleansing acidity push an air-tight finish.
Flat and fleshy smelling, with little zap and only soft green fruit aromas. The palate maintains some tang and citrus, while flavors of lemon and tangerine are chunky, loud and lean toward bitter on the finish.
The Loner title seems to refer to an absence of oak, although it's not entirely unoaked. The wine spent time in what the winemaker calls “seasoned barriques” that lent no overt oak influence, but let the wine breathe and mellow. Marked by intense lemon, lime and mineral flavors, this bone-dry wine is elegant and eccentric.
Bulky and rugged but sound, with some drying tannins on the finish. It compensates by offering attractive flavors of black cherries, black olives and hints of asphalt and garrigue. Try it with hearty braises or stews.
This is a fruity wine with cherry fruits and a soft, juicy texture. It's lively and fresh, with good acidity at the end.
Delicate citrus, spice and flowers lead this pretty Chardonnay from Macari. On the palate, attractive flavors of toast, citrus and fresh fruit are soft and subtle. A pretty wine for everyday cuisine.
With 14 months oak aging, this structured, spicy wine shows considerable toast. A strongly smoky character is freshened by the red currant and blackberry fruitiness. Acidity gives the wine a lift and also promises aging. Drink from 2017.
Joins very ripe, tropical fruits (like guavas and papayas) to vanilla-tinged, smoky oak to produce a likeable, flavorful Chard. Has a rich, almost thick, creamy texture that finishes with a swirl of spices.
This seems to be this critter label's best product. It's full of fruit and nicely balanced, with snappy berry aromas and flavors. The wine delivers moderate depth and spice, with pleasant residual flavors. Great for anyone looking for a solid but uncomplicated wine. 60% Cabernet, 40% Syrah.
The Indelicato family's vineyard is basically the entire appellation. This hearty blend of Syrah, Grenache, Petit Verdot and Viognier shows it off well, with fruit-driven aromas of grape juice, grape seeds, olallieberries and sandalwood. The palate shows decent structure as well as blackberry fruit, dried oregano, beef jerky, peppercorn and sanguine flavors.
Charbono is a variety that used to be more widely planted. It's always a rustic wine, but it ages forever, and can develop sweet complexities. In its youth, it's fruity, soft and tannic, with ripe blackberry and chocolate flavors.
A little sharp and green minty in the mouth, this Syrah is very dry. As far as fruit goes, it has modest cherry-berry flavors, but it's really a pretty thin wine.
Mildly spritzy, sweet and orange flavored, this low-alcohol, frizzanté-style bubbly is a very pleasant springtime quaffer. Serve it quite cold, and it can open or close a picnic in style.
A roasted, leathery cap sits atop a bouquet of meaty berry fruit, leading to a somewhat burnt and brambly set of aromas. The palate, however, is quite fresh and edgy, with good acidity pushing lively red-fruit and mild vanilla flavors. Herbal on the finish, but sturdy overall.
A flagship from the Krems cooperative, highlighting the famed steep Pfaffenberg vineyard. The wine is perfumed, white flower aromas followed with the crispest of currant and green fruits. There is light spice, finishing a deliciously aromatic wine.
Pierre Lurton runs Cheval Blanc and d'Yquem and this winery, his home château. This is a smooth wine, full-bodied and with a soft texture. It is ripe with apricot and pear flavors, cut with sliced apple. A touch of spice adds interest. With its ripe, full aftertaste the wine shows the plumper side of the vintage. It is ready to drink.
Darker red in color, with a dusty, full bouquet. Flavors of plum, raspberry and apple skins are appealing and on the money, as is the mouthfeel and the fresh, drying finish. There seems to be a little bit of everything running through this cava, and the end result is rock solid.
Warm, loamy, oaky aromas of pastry and blackberry set up a tannic, jammy, cheek-pounding mouthfeel. This is 75% Malbec and the rest Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. It's dark and chocolaty, with blackberry, prune and coffee flavors. A heaping of chocolate and fig makes the finish quite friendly; drink through 2019.
Franco Pacenti's enticing Brunello opens with a sudden blast of cinnamon stick and nutmeg that slowly evolves to include tones of cherry, Indian spice, smoke and even a touch of dried green herb. The penetrating finish offers more clove and sweet spice flavor.
Smoky toasty scents dominate this 50-50 blend of Tempranillo and Grenache. Firm purple fruits offer a taste of Spanish varietal character, with accents of bull's blood. This needs a bit more bottle age, which should continue to flesh out the finish.
This portion of the winery's vineyard always yields Cabernets of enormous concentration with hard tannins. The 2009 is a classic, detonating in the mouth with laserlike blackberry and cassis flavors, to which new oak brings additional richness of smoky cedar. It's really a beautiful wine, but very tannic, even by Von Strasser standards. Give it at least eight years, and it could be drinking well 20 years from now.
A simple, acceptable wine, thin and hot, but with a decent taste of cherry cola. Tasted twice.
Taylor's (marketed as Wakefield internationally) seems to be on a roll. This is a complex, multidimensional Shiraz laced with nuances ranging from mulberry and plum to meat and spice and on to coffee and black olive. It's medium-bodied, with tannins that are supple enough to make it approachable right away.
Oddly oily, with aromas of cotton candy. Heavy citrus and pineapple makes up the flavor profile, and the finish lacks intensity. Bland overall, and loses focus rapidly. Imported by Terra Andina.
This 75-25 Grenache-Shiraz blend features complex aromas of pepper, dusty earth, leather and black cherries. The tannins are ripe, the mouthfeel round and the fruit surges forward on the palate, picking up a touch of licorice on the finish. Drink now–2012.
Fruity and forward with ripe blackberry and cherry flavors, this Merlot-based blend is balanced with savory layers of dried herb and crushed granite minerality. Vibrant acidity and soft but penetrating tannins extend on the finish.
Bouquet is nice and smooth, with an earthy warmth surrounding scents of purple flowers and crushed berries. The palate is lively and acidic, with semisweet red-fruit flavors that are more generic. No reticence here; the wine is racy to the end as it finishes with oak and vanilla.
Open and immediately accessible, this is fragrant and gently floral, with clearly defined varietal character. It opens beautifully into an elegant, aromatic and crisply structured wine, with excellent length.
Clean and crisp with mineral nuances backed by peach and passion fruit, this white Lacryma Christi has all the right qualities to pair with finger foods and salads. The wine is lightweight and lean but tonic and firm at the same time.
This stainless-steel Chardonnay from above Malibu starts out light, tasting of grapefruit and orange, and is fairly crisp with a nice dollop of anise, but finishes too tart, almost sour as if it's been oddly acidified.
From a site planted by Steve MacRostie in 1998, this white sings in complexity and tension, providing tart jolts of lemon verbena, ginger and nutmeg. Complex and elegant, especially in its floral perfume, it drinks voluptuously, full of come-hither ripeness.

Smooth, deep berry flavors are matched by spice and leather, while the finish is oak driven, with coffee, coconut and chocolate notes. Drink now–2018.
This is a lightly colored rosé, fresh as a red currant while having a tight texture of crisp acidity. It does need some bottle age to bring out the fuller fruit and ripe red berries. Drink this bottling from 2015, while Arnaud Margaine continues to improve the vineyards worked by the family for four generations.
Arguably the best Seña to date. This blend of Cabernet, Merlot, Carmenère, Cab Franc and Petit Verdot opens with a mix of perfume, spice and prickle along with raspberry. The palate is flush and flashy, with a complex blend of strawberry, raspberry, vanilla, cinnamon and tobacco flavors. Smooth as a glass table, and slightly creamy. Excellent Chilean wine to drink now through 2010.
Spicy and fruity, this has notes of raspberry and cola, with a brisk, full-bodied mouthfeel. It's easy to drink with pasta or barbecue.
Tolloy brings us a bright and luminous Pinot Grigio with a very attractive price tag. You'll recognize aromas of citrus, peach, passion fruit and kiwi and the wine would pair with tuna or curry chicken salad.

Produced from a certified organic vineyard, the finish displays dark cherry and chocolate flavors with peppery accents.
With light wood-aging flavors, this creamy wine is still young, with tangy orange and lemon zest as well as touches of vanilla. Let it develop further and drink from late 2017.

Made from 100% Sauvignon Blanc fermented and aged in stainless steel tanks, this wine shows why Dry Creek Valley has achieved such a fine reputation with this variety. Totally dry and brisk in acidity, it has savory flavors of lemons and limes, passionfruit, gooseberries and white pepper. Awesome with Vietnamese, Ethiopian and Indian fare calling for white wine.
A marvelous Pinot Noir to drink now and over the next 6–7 years. It feels so rich and elaborate, with waves of raspberries, cherries, cola and oak, yet is tightly controlled by firm tannins and a great burst of citrusy acidity. Grows better and better as it warms in the glass.
Winemaker: Kevin Arnold. A Bordeaux-style blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 23% Cabernet Franc and 7% Petit Verdot, this is quite toasty and spicy upfront, with pronounced notes of baked mulberry, boysenberry and cassis that are dusted by earthy, rooty tree bark and woodspice. More ripe fruit flavors, medium-plus tannins and ample acidity result in a crushed-satin texture, finishing long and dry. Drink now–2024.
A Roman classic that often appears on trattoria tables besides grilled vegetables or insalata di mare, this classic Frascati Superiore offers subtle aromas of dried hay, citrus and pear.
A terrific value if you can find it (alas, only 150 cases were imported), this is full bodied and richly textured, marrying hints of peppery spice with grilled lavender and rosemary that perfectly season the beach cherry and mocha flavors. It's stout, tannic and mouth coating on the finish, ideal for matching with roasts or steaks. Drink 2018–2025.
Uncharacteristically earthy and spicy for a Mosel wine, with flavors of loam accented by musky spice notes. It's off dry in style yet relatively broad on the palate, again setting itself apart from the mainstream.
This is always a topflight bottling, and winemaker Ron Bunnell gets the same rows and uses the same barrel regimen and winemaking methods. So what is different? Vintage variation. In 2006 the wines are tighter and slower to open, perhaps longer lived, and show less of the immediately seductive fruit flavors of 2005. Boushey-McPherson is naturally sharp and edgy when young anyway, and those characteristics are much in evidence here, so this is a wine to decant if you plan to drink it anytime soon.
This Pinot Noir is raisiny on the nose but maintains a fresh outlook. The palate runs heavy, almost to the point of feeling flat, while the flavor profile offers ripe berry, cherry and raisin notes. It's plump and soft on the finish, with a resin-like taste. Only 48 cases produced.
Enticing aromas of wild berry, pressed rose, cake spice and chewing tobacco come together on this gorgeous wine. The firmly structured palate delivers juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon, licorice and clove. It's well balanced, with ripe, velvety tannins that will make it approachable earlier than other vintages but still age-worthy. Drink 2019–2036.
This Colchagua Valley blend smells of lead pencil, coconut, black cherry, spice and vanilla. The mouthfeel is firm, solid and complete, with dark berry, fine herbs and spice flavors. On one hand it's fresh and alert; on the other hand its dense and brooding, with coffee and dark spice accents. Drink now–2017; only 355 cases produced.
Roasted berry, black pepper and mild leafy aromas are true to the region. The palate is full but not heavy or clumsy; flavors of earthy berry fruits show a touch of raisin, while the finish is loamy and smooth. Drink this approachable wine now through 2018.
Luna Selvatica (“wild moon”) is an easy and straightforward expression of Cabernet Sauvignon that shows dark fruit, cola, licorice and a touch of toasted spice. In the mouth, the wine shows alcoholic power and some grittiness on the finish.
Lean, dry and minerally, with tart flavors of grapefruit, lemon peel and Asian pear. The acidity is refreshingly crisp. This is a bottling that rarely does well in blind tastings because it's so austere. But it is elegant.
The 2015s from the Tavel cooperative universally impressed. This cuvée, drawn from terroirs dominated by galets roulés, combines notes of crushed stones and ripe cherries. It's still tight and primary; like many good Tavels, it should drink better two years from the harvest than it does now.
With 250 cases imported, this Reserve is easier to acquire, half the price and almost as satisfying as the brand's Limited Release offering. Loaded with influence of the surrounding garrigue, including bay leaves and sage, aromas and flavors of black cherries, plum skin, violets and tar also abound. Velvety in texture and full in the mouth with a long, evolving finish that ends on a divine mocha note.
Sassy spice and piquant touches of furniture wax, root beer, wild berries, licorice and white truffle open the nose of this vineyard-designate Barolo. In general, the spice aromas stand out most and the wine is squeaky-polished in the mouth. Drink after 2015.
This wine of unknown grape varieties shows a thread of sweet cola and vanilla throughout a larger tunnel of smoky char, remaining somewhat flat, bitter and simple on the palate.
Aromas of geraniums, celery and grassy fruits lead the nose, while flavors of green, soupy red berries finish stemmy.
This is La Rural's top line, and before we've been a fan of the Malbec. But this wine has serious balance issues; it's acidic and sour at the core, with heavy oak and not enough flesh. Hails from the cooler Tupungato region, something that's evident in the wine's thin structure.
Located in Tavel, Domaine de la Mordorée has been one of the quality leaders in neighboring Lirac. This wine is dark and earthy at first, but opens with airing to reveal bold notes of blueberry, mocha and peppery spice. This 50-50 blend of Grenache and Syrah is full bodied, richly textured and finishes long.
A bit dark, narrow and crusty on the nose, with oak-driven berry fruit aromas. The palate is chewy, broad and generally well balanced, with savory, semi-herbal flavors of berry and cassis. Creamy and savory on the finish, with a little more oak than the basic fruit deserves.
This elegant, fragrant expression of Orvieto delivers heady aromas of tropical fruit, apricot and citrus. The linear palate doles out juicy peach, pineapple and lemon zest accented with a hint of aromatic herb. Vibrant acidity provides the framework.
There's a slightly unripe vegetal note to this Pinot. Despite some good black raspberries and currants and oak, that green note persists, modulating the wine's pleasures. Drink now.
Although still a respectable effort, this is a weak link in the Buller arsenal of fortifieds, with a minty, slightly medicinal edge to the modest berry fruit and dark, earthy undercurrents. Turns tart and crisp on the finish.
Aged in 100% new wood, this massive wine is full of dark plum and fragrant strawberries. It is also packed with dark tannins that give the wine a dry core. The fruitiness has a strongly juicy character, fragrant with acidity and freshness. The end is a reminder that this is a powerful wine. Drink from 2020.
Lean but dry and clean, with some tough tannins framing flavors of cherries, grilled meat and black pepper. Drink now.
Hot and awkward, with jammy cherry, blackberry and chocolate flavors. High alcohol gives this wine an unbalanced, chili pepper burn.
There's a meaty, ripe aspect to the aromas here that recall black cherry and smoked ham. But there's also an edgy green tone that lends a slightly bitter impression in the mouth.
Starts off slightly nutty, but also boasts pear and honeysuckle scents. It's smooth and easy to drink, with dried spices accenting ripe pears alongside a hint of cashew. Clean, elegant and citrusy on the finish, even if not overly concentrated. Imported by Teton Selections.
This is a coppery-tinged, pale-flamingo pink blend of Grenache, Syrah and Merlot that's dry and taut. Crisp flavors of underripe stone fruit and melon provide ample summer refreshment. Drink now.
In this much-celebrated well-ripened vintage, the Shea designate has a pleasingly soft entry. The lush persistent flavors of black-cherry and blackberry fruit are streaked with vanilla, tobacco and cola highlights. Drink now and over the next four to five years.
Heady aromas of yellow field flower, dried Mediterranean herb and a whiff of tropical fruit lead the nose. The juicy palate delivers ripe pear, peach, pineapple and wild fennel. Fresh acidity lifts up the creamy finish.
Dark in color, as befits a wine that was food trodden in open fermenters. To say it has a Port-like feel is to emphasize the wine's concentration, the mellifluous tannins and the powerful black fruits. It needs several years aging.
The numbers represent the grapes within: 75% Merlot, 23% Cabernet Sauvignon and 2% Petit Verdot. High in acidity, it shows a crispness of red berry, its core juicy and easy to like. Integrated oak keeps things simple and round, with leather and tobacco poking their heads on the finish.
Hints of pungent boxwood mark the nose of this lean, narrowly constructed wine. The flavors are grassier, “rounded out” by tart citrus and green tomato notes. Drink now.
Organically grown grapes have resulted in a soft, crisp and clean wine. It has bright pure fruits with white-peach and red-currant flavors along with stylish acidity. The wine is ready to drink.
Cherry and watermelon aromas are fair and easy, while raspberry and plum-skin flavors finish pithy and citrusy.
Bigger and richer than the Starmont bottling, with correspondingly heavier oak. Lots of toast and grilled pineapple and peach notes on the nose, followed by a mouthfilling wine laced with smoky accents. Echoes of butter and dark toast on the finish.
With its ripe and perfumed character, the wine is not quite dry. It's already maturing, with its fruity acidity muted by almonds, ripe pear skins and a tight, mineral texture. This intense wine will be ready by 2015.
This sweet wine smells like ripe plums and tastes fresh, grapy and sugary, with a little sparkle in the texture. It's quite sweet on the finish, too.
Crisp and a little minty smelling, with wild berry and dry spice as the primary aromas. It's thick and chunky but well balanced, with sweet, slightly medicinal flavors of black fruits and mint. Solid and smooth on the finish.
Very balanced wine, with the acidity well integrated into the ripe botrytis and firm texture. The wine has a poise to it, a lightness of touch, but will also age well.
Very ripe and fruity-spicy, almost like a Zinfandel except for the silkiness, this Pinot shows flavors of black cherry pie filling, red currants and pomegranates, with earthier notes of cola and sweet tobacco. It's a bone dry wine whose thick tannins suggest modest ageability. Now through 2012.
Dark and somewhat heady, this opens with dense aromas of mashed blackberry, black tea, bark and peppery spice. The palate is similarly dense and concentrated, although the medium tannins lend the wine a crushed-satin texture that keeps it from feeling too decadent. The finish is long, with a solid pepper streak.
Roasted at first, with smoked ham and bacon aromas along with clove and other hard spice notes. The palate is oaky, with chewy tannins and a thick texture; flavors of blackberry are meaty and rich, while clove and more dry spices reappear on the finish. A different breed for Mendoza.
The Cartizze cru is characterized by its elegance and Adami's expression lives up to the task thanks to its notes of delicate white peach, citrus blossom and white stone. In the mouth, it boasts pulpy, creamy complexity with a playful touch of sweetness.
With its tannins, this is initially a firm wine, but then ripe berry fruits emerge, followed by great acidity and freshness.

Palmeri has a good history with Syrah, and this 2011 is right up there. With rich, complex blackberry and blueberry jam, cassis, salted grilled beef, black pepper and smoky oak flavors, it is sophisticated enough to drink with upscale fare. It should age well through 2020.
Smells fairly burnt and dull, with earthy, stemmy aromas that are strained and tough. The palate reflects the nose with heavy, roasted, leathery plum flavors that finish with a meaty thud. Rustic and stemmy, with a low pulse.
A lovely wine, soft and supple, with a superb tannin structure framing the most interesting and delicious flavors. Blackberries, blueberries, red and black currants, anise and cedar notes all come together in balanced harmony, leading to a long, dry finish. Not an ager, but an elegant Napa Valley wine to drink now and over the next few years.
Opens like a luxury-level Malbec should; it's dark and dense, with black cherry, smoke and rubbery aromas. The palate is deep and juicy, with bold, attractive black fruit, plum, tobacco and vanilla flavors. Smooth, healthy and drinkable now.
Another good job at a relatively inexpensive white variety from Clos du Bois. With Lake and Sonoma county grapes, the wine shows good Sauvignon Blanc character. Dry and crisp, it's savory in lemongrass, grapefruit and peach flavors that are lightly oaked.
This simple wine has juicy blueberry and baked cherry flavors at its core, a lushness on the palate that is supported by firm tannins and oak.
The nose on this bottling is very smoky and flinty, but also shows underlying pear and apple aromas. There's an intriguing lime-zest character to the palate, with a base of dried apples and a smoked-wood character that's hard to ignore.
Despite showing jammy, raisiny aromas, this wide and thick Tempranillo shows just enough acidity to maintain balance. Dense flavors of prune and berry lead to a chewy, medium-length finish.
This opens with aromas of toasted oak, coffee, ripe berry, sage and a whiff of citrus zest. On the palate, white pepper and coconut back up the core of dried cherry alongside astringent tannins, but it lacks fruit richness.

Touches of wood smoke and cardamom give an exotic streak to this full-bodied and dark-colored wine. It has deep fruit flavors like blackberry and prune, good balance and light tannins to enhance the texture.
Very compelling aromas of fresh whipping cream and vanilla bean take on some black pepper notes with air. On the palate, you get textbook Shiraz, with nice graham cracker accents.
Slightly nutty and plywoody on the nose, partially redeemed by a plump mouthfeel. Flavors tend toward unripe pear and grapefruit.
This is a succulently juicy, light wine that is refreshing from start to finish. A wealth of jasmine, crisp apple and white peach combine effortlessly on the palate. With a kick of creaminess and power on the finish, it's the ideal wine for tapas and appetizers of all flavors.
Underbrush, moist soil, menthol and woodland berry aromas unfold in the glass. The structured palate offers ripe black cherry, raspberry, licorice and a hint of mocha alongside fine-grained tannins and bright acidity.

Be prepared for a murky visual in this unusual, concentrated and complex wine. The appearance is hazy and the color brassy, but the flavors are vivid, fresh and bracing. The mouthfeel has great acidity, an unusually thick texture and fine tannins. A sense of layering and intensity develops with more sips, and lingers on the finish.
Here's a simple and tart Valpolicella that would pair with easy stay-home meals. The wine is redolent of white cherry, cranberry and violet. It's crisp, fresh and one dimensional in the mouth.
This tannic blend is 40% Grenache, 40% Syrah and 20% Petite Sirah. It opens with black cherry and cassis fruit, with a strong flavor of charred wood. Flavors are front-loaded, as the wine quickly turns thin and vinegary.
A beautifully perfumed wine, this is very mineral and steely with currant flavors, a splash of lime and complex acidity. Behind this, there is a more ripe character, with richness and a warmer feel. Great acidity and youthfulness promise several years' aging. Screwcap.
Initially firmly tannic, this opens to reveal fine blackberry fruit and fresh acidity. It's a generous wine, the wood aging giving tannins and spice while the delicious fruit offers a rounder, smoother side. Drink from 2020.
Rather than vertical and direct aromas, this Amarone offers plush, broad ones that glide over the senses with vanilla-honey, powdered chocolate, black cherry and spice. American Tony Raimondi and his wife Lucia present a modern wine with good presence and endurance.
Comes down on the simple, straightforward side, with slightly sweet flavors of spearmint chewing gum, vanilla and lemon and lime soda. Fortunately, the acidity is crisp and cleansing.
An enormously rich Pinot Nor, stunningly delicious. Hard to imagine a California Pinot offering more opulent notes at such a young age. Dazzles with raspberry and cherry pie filling, vanilla, toast and scads of spices, and feels so soft, so silky, yet finishes so dry. Really a stunner. Should glidepath through the next six years, gradually growing mushroomy.
You may or may not fancy the blue bottle, but the juice inside is a good example of Yakima Valley Riesling. Tea, honey and lemon flavors are co-mingled; and the 5% residual sugar adds sweetness without becoming grainy or cloying.
The heavy bottle is probably a good proportion of the price of this wine—an unnecessary affectation. The wine itself is firm and structured, perfumed with typical Touriga Nacional violet aromas and rich. With its dense texture and juicy black plum fruits, it is still coming together, so don't drink before 2017.
This is an absolutely beautiful white wine (made from a bland of Ansonica and Chardonnay) that delivers rich and opulent tones of stone fruit, mon blossom. The wine excels in the mouth thanks to its richness and smooth creaminess.
Too soft and too sweet, with sugared cherry, raspberry, blackberry and chocolate flavors. Okay and clean, but with this inherent sweetness, the wine could use more balancing acids and tannins.
This is a great example of the power that can come a Grand Cru vineyard. It's opulent and dense, but more than that it has intense energy and drive. Although the wine is marked as medium sweet, the spice and pepper give it a dry, tight, nervy edge. The wine is still young and will be best from 2017.
The aroma says wood, and that's what the taste confirms. To go with the wood, there is rounded apricot and peach-flavored fruit, open and rich. The wine has a youthful taut edge, finishing with the greatest acidity.
Pressed apple and pear notes are accented by hints of cinnamon and clove in this fresh, approachable wine. It's ripe and rounded but balanced by a kick of lemon-lime acidity that lingers through the finish.
Blue flower, ripe cherry, leather and cake spice aromas carry over to the palate along with velvety tannins. Reflecting the heat of the vintage, it's forward and evolved with soft acidity. Drink through 2019.
This wine is all varietal coming from the esteemed Seven Hills Vineyard. Aromas of moist earth, bittersweet chocolate, cherry and spice lead to beautifully balanced pit-fruit flavors that show intensity and suppleness, with a finish that won't quit.
Byrne is a relatively young Clare Valley producer, having made its own wines only since 2008. This Reserve Cabernet features some charred oak and espresso notes on the nose, then ripe, plummy fruit on the palate. It's full bodied, dusty and extracted, boasting plenty of intensity, but lacking polish in this youthful state. It should improve for at least the next five years or so.
Adelsheim helped to pioneer Dijon clone Chardonnay in Oregon, a movement that completely reshaped and reinvigorated those wines.

This is almost pure Cab, with the addition of just 2% Malbec. Solidly in the firm, muscular, polished style of winemaker Holly Turner, this is a substantial effort that will need to be decanted if you are going to drink it any time soon. Black cherry, cassis and blue plum are swathed in milk chocolate, but this is Cabernet with its sinews intact, showing streaks of herb, smoke and light pepper. I can't imagine a better companion to it than a good, rare steak.
This young, grapy wine has buoyant flavors of raspberry jam. It needs more time, but the fruit is excellent; the finish just a little warm.

A light and somewhat racy Pinotage with good vibrancy to the strawberry and ripe pomegranate seed notes throughout. A kiss of vanilla on the close adds a touch of decadence to this otherwise straightforward wine.

The finish is long and dry and returns to that pure note of Williams pear. Drink 2017–2035.

Some ageable Cabs are also drinkable on release. Not this one. It's just too tannic. The astringency stings the palate, making the acidity feel more pronounced, and effectively smothering the fruit. But it's good, rich blackberry fruit. Already throwing some sediment, the wine should begin to come into its own around 2018.
This is dark and slightly murky, with sweet scents of cooked fruits and baking spices. Somehow it keeps the alcohol levels well down (13%) but the fruit flavors are ultra-ripe, pruney, and deep.

This is not a wine that will ring everyone's bell, but it offers a lot of flavor.

Pagliatura comes from the Italian word for “straw” and as the name suggests, the wine boasts a pretty golden hay color. The nose is weighed down by waxy smells that range from scented candle to honeycomb and there are also some mineral shadings at the back. The mouthfeel is waxy and fat.
Bright and spicy and loaded with great, clean, pure fruit flavors. This is exemplary for the '06 vintage; a wine of lovely purity and focus.

Vibrant lemon-lime acidity, it finishes long with a hint of lime-skin pith.
The nice thing about Ripasso Secco Bertani is that it shows enormous harmony between its various parts. The nose is bigger, so to speak, with vibrant aromas of red fruit and soft spice. The mouthfeel, however, is tight and streamlined.

This 2008, like its predecessor, captures the complexity, grace and compelling charm of the grape. Dense and still light, it brings honey, tea, lemon, nectarine, jasmine, lime, caramel and sweet nut flavors together, a riotous jumble that is beyond delicious.

Mostly Aglianico, but its blended with approximately 15% Piedirosso from Vesuvio. This is Mastroberardino's luxury cuvée, so it's aged in barrique, but the influence isn't overdone.

It is an exceptional expression of the Sonoma Coast, being translucent in color, dry, silky and crisp in acids.

Nice and dry, with crisp, citrusy acidity and a touch of creamy oak. Shows savory flavors of Meyer lemons, limes and tingly Asian spices, with a touch of green apple butter. Clean and food-friendly.
A bit foresty and damp at first and then more open, fruity and lush later. The palate offers mostly snappy black cherry and cassis, while the finish is short but sturdy, with mild oak notes and decent tannins. Improves upon airing and will go with most foods.
This is part of a series of wines named after the subsoil in which the vines are planted. The soil in this case is formed from igneous rocks. It gives a fine, pure wine that has great richness as well as fresh apple and pear flavors. The wine with just that extra few months aging is ready to drink.

Basic Port, slightly syrupy and sweet, with dried cherry and chocolate flavors and a plump, easygoing mouthfeel. Imported by Pernod Ricard.
Soft, structured and grippy, this lovely blend will serve well both at the table and with a crowd. It's pleasing in its elegant concentration of ripe red cherry and peppery plum.
A touch of evolution is immediately apparent: that chamomile lift and dried citrus peel nose gives it away. The  dry palate then serves up notions of ripe but tart apple, incisive lemon freshness and a more generous, fluid rich texture that play off each other beautifully. On the finish it is the lemon that shines, alongside some notions of candle wax and more chamomile. A lovely snapshot of a Riesling on its trajectory. Drink 2017-2027.

This wine starts off a bit smoky and cedary, but with time it develops more typical Hermitage notes of cassis, hickory smoke and meat. It's medium to full in body, with a rich texture and long finish. Approachable now, but should age easily through 2018.

The spectrum of varietal aromas is here: saline, olive, forest floor, tea and red and black fruits. Weighty and round in the mouth, with good feel and full blackberry flavors supported by creamy oak and vanilla. Juicy and red enough on the finish, where a pop of acidity registers.

91-93 Barrel sample. Ripe, balanced wine that brings rich fruit and sweet tannins together with firm black plum skin and spice. The tannins come through as dusty and rich, not dry.
This is still very tightly coiled: the nose says little and the palate holds on tight to its beautifully pure blueberry fruit. There is lip-smacking freshness and a very finely woven tannin structure but this impressive wine does need time to come into itself and relax its fruit. There is something profound and stony about this, something mysterious, brooding and wild. Cellar this and then rejoice. Drink 2020–2035.

Good Cab from a hot vintage in a hot valley. The wine sure is ripe, with cassis and plum flavors dusted with cocoa, and dry, with enough tannins to leave the palate puckery. It straddles the line between drink-me-now and a more complex age-me, without resolving the issue.

Standard plum and berry aromas form a harmonious opening. The palate on this Cab is a bit acidic, with a clipped overall mouthfeel and lightly baked, earthy flavors of generic black fruits. The finish is leathery tasting and chewy.

The 2009 vintage was successful for Sausal's three new Zinfandels, and this intense, concentrated bottling shows how the cool weather managed to ripen the grapes, yet keep alcohol levels moderate. It's a big, powerful wine, packed with wild berry, cola, licorice, spice and sandalwood flavors that have a tang of the earth.
An unusual blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec, with a splash of Merlot, this is a beautiful wine. It's also a young one, brimming with tight, youthful tannins that give it a lockdown astringency.

Rubbery black-fruit aromas come with a distinct and strong whiff of bacon. In the mouth, this is full, angular and highly tannic. A bacon-like flavor leads plum and saucy tomato notes, while this is chunky and scrubbing on the finish, with a flavor of clove.
Here's an extremely simple sparkler with a shy nose and flavors suggesting acacia, apple and a hint of green melon. Brisk acidity provides the backdrop.
Here is a huge ripe and luxurious wine, with great power. The texture is solid, filled with firm tannins, the flavors are black and ripe. Along with the power, though, is much of the elegance and poise that characterizes great Saint-Julien.
This is a big, mouthfilling Cabernet, rich and voluptuous in fruit. Although it's a bit hot in alcohol, you hardly notice it, with the explosion of blackberries, raisins and chocolate-covered cherries, made even richer by smoky-sweet oak. Delicious now and through 2014.
This late harvest dessert wine from Sardinia is made with native grape Nasco and a small amount of Malvasia di Cagliari.

Velvety smooth yet fresh, it makes a perfect after dinner drink, or pair it with aged cheeses or fruit tarts.
The tanginess of grapefruit peel, paired with very ripe Bosc pear, is already apparent on the nose before becoming full-blown on the palate. There is concentration and precision.

Dry and silky in texture, but there's not much else going on, except for modest cherry, tobacco and herb flavors.
The Carmenère in this Carm-Cabernet-Syrah blend is the lead singer, so expect a touch of minty green and herbal essence. It's a heavyweight in the sense that the mouthfeel is big and the tannins are a little hard. But with airing it unveils classy, spicy berry flavors and wood-based accents of vanilla and butter (20 months in new oak will do that). A big wine that needs some airing. Ready now but can rest well in the cellar for a few more years.
Dominated by aromas of dried spices, cedar and leather, this full-bodied, lusty red shows more oak than fruit, although the tannins are clearly ripe and the body of the wine adequately supports the ample cedar and vanilla flavors.

Bonnet was this family's winery in 1744. André Lurton took over in 1953 and in 2015, the third warmest year since 1900, his team created a wine with tropical fruits, mango and pineapple.

This 60% Mavro and 40% Maratheftiko red blend is the winery's staple wine, and a great introduction to native Cypriot varieties. Red berries, spice and a touch of vanilla are buoyed by a fresh acidity, giving the wine a food-friendly advantage. A wine with structure and elegance, that will pair well with cheeses, meats and game.
The welcoming blackberry and cassis aromas are friendly and approachable. The mouthfeel is lush, layered and grabby, with serious structure and dark, handsome flavors of black fruit, cassis, tobacco and black olive. Spicy and dry, it shows some mentholated warmth on the finish.

One of the few certified organic Chiantis, this tastes good now and should improve over the next two to four years.
Done entirely in stainless steel tanks, this includes a percentage of fruit from Girardet's original 1971 plantings. It went through full malolactic, resulting in a broad, somewhat dilute wine with lightly spiced flavors of green and yellow apples. Notes of lemongrass and metal come up in the finish.

Round and rich, this wine takes on renewed complexity in the glass. Seductive in earthy red and black berry fruit and exotic spice, it offers naturally realized structure in a stylized package that should remain interesting for years.
Black currant, bell pepper and leather aromas lead the way on this blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon. The dense palate delivers ripe black cherry, grilled pepper, mocha and cracked black pepper alongside bracing tannins.

A dash of Viognier in the blend gives aromatic lift to this Côtes du Rhône, which tastes like honeyed peaches over sun-warmed stones. It's full and broad without being overblown, but seems to be teetering on the edge, with signs of age starting to creep in. Drink up.

Forward and candied in raspberries and cherries, this is a tasty wine, dry and crisp in acidity, but it's a bit direct and one-dimensional right now. Depends for its appeal on sheer, ripe fruitiness. With these wines, you never know where they'll go.
Eolo is Trivento's prized wine, and this vintage hammers away from the start with blackberry, toast and pepper aromas. The palate is huge and extracted, with dark, fat blackberry flavors that are tempered by graphite and minty oak. It's as black as they come, with mint and licorice flavors on the finish. An inky, intense wine, with less than 500 cases made.

94–96. Barrel sample. Firmly tannic in character, this wine is dry and extracted. There's potential for this powerful, impressive wine to bear the wine's very dry character with the weight of its fruit.
This 90% Sangiovese, 5% Merlot and 5% Colorino blend opens with aromas that recall forest floor, dark berry and a whiff of toast. On the palate, notes of ground pepper, anise and cocoa accent a core of black cherry while firm, fine-grained tannins provide support. Drink through 2017.

Cabernet Sauvignon (45%) takes the lead on this blend, followed by Merlot (30%), Cabernet Franc (20%) and Petit Verdot. The aromas are all high toned, with notes of vanilla, herb and dark fruit. The black-fruit flavors are tightly wound, needing time in the cellar to stretch their legs. Best after 2020.
A mere 40 cases of this LD exists, a lucky find in the cellar laid down in 2001 and forgotten about until this year. A blend of 60% Pinot Noir and 40% Chardonnay, it's fragrant in dried fruit and boasts a thick, unctuous mouthfeel. Briny, dry and tart, with the taste of fresh-squeezed lemon, it's a philosophical exercise in the art of patience.

Prospective purchasers should bear in mind that this wine was harvested at sugar levels far beyond the minimum spätlese requirements. This is more of a big auslese or small beerenauslese in terms of sugar and style, marrying dried apricot aromas with notes of candied pineapple and spice. It's very sweet and honeyed, and would be cloying were it not for its firm acid backbone. This can be cellared for 20 years. Imported by Chapin Cellars, LLC.
Aromas of brick dust, vitamins and baked fruits are gritty and require some navigating. This has a wiry, tight feel, yet in terms of flavors, it's ripe almost to the point of being raisiny. Heat, hard tannins and dried berry fruit flavors direct the finish. Drink through 2017.

Raw and fresh, with jammy mulberry, blackberry and pepper flavors. A rustic wine for rustic food.

Old vines on a single parcel provide the base of this fresh-faced wine. It has an attractive herbaceous and green-fruit character that's laced with a grapefruit note. This has exceptional depth of flavor, and the aftertaste is more steely and flinty.
The Fairvalley Chardonnay begins with aromas of lemon, pear and spice, and on the palate, offers citrusy, spicy flavors that are both refreshing and appealing. Though not the most complex wine, it's a good go-to wine for everyday drinking. Solid and well made.
This dark, concentrated blend of five grapes opens with spicy aromas of coffee, black fruits and toasty oak. If the palate is a touch firm, airing or more time in bottle will soothe that. Tar, spice, olive, herbs and black-fruit flavors are deep and seamless, backed by licorice and chocolate on the finish. Drink through 2023.
Named after the Nez Perce name for the Clearwater River, this blend is mostly Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, with some Cabernet Franc and Syrah thrown in the mix. The aromas are light, with notes of berry and sweet spices. The cherry flavors are very soft, getting a bit attenuated on the back half on this otherwise pleasant red.
Aromas are leafy and scratchy, also suggesting cement. This feels resiny and creamy in the mouth. Flavors of woody, generic berry fruits finish hot and scratchy.
This opens with aromas of red berry and black-skinned fruit. On the fresh, easy-drinking palate, savory notes of black pepper accent ripe plum and juicy strawberry. Bright acidity and soft tannins balance the juicy fruit. Enjoy through 2015.
Appealing white-flower and apple aromas turn more dusty and briny with air. This feels tight and citrusy, just as Verdejo should. Flavors of orange, green herbs and pickle brine finish with a lot of life and zest.
This is a nicely integrated wine with good balance and structure. Though the finish could be a bit longer, the forward red currant and plum flavors mingling with hints of tomato, tobacco and spice create just enough complexity.
Certainly intensely sweet, but it is the acidity that adds much to this wine. It is still very young with its bright acidity, mango and pineapple fruits and a dry edge from honey and botrytis. It needs aging for at least five years and more. Screwcap.
While 2010 was a great vintage in most of Spain, parts of Bierzo had a mildew problem and thus some wines are less than fully ripe. This seems to be a case in point; it's scratchy on the nose, with a sinewy, drawing mouthfeel that's only partly covered up by oak. Prickly berry and black cherry flavors finish tight, with scraping tannins. Drink now with meat or cheese.

With a high proportion of the local Rolle grape in the blend, this is a lightly perfumed wine with a strong herbal element. It is a ripe finely structured wine, with great acidity and orange flavors. A style of wine that will be better for a few more months, it should be drunk from late 2017.
In a medium sweet style, the wine has a light prickle and fine citrus acidity to balance the soft freshness. It is a refreshing wine, totally drinkable immediately.
Displaying typical McMinnville AVA subtlety, this frames its tight raspberry fruit with mineral and iron ore details. Aging in neutral oak has helped soften the sharp edges a bit, without flavoring the wine.
More full and powerful than the regular Merlot, with berry compote, lemon peel and toast on the nose. Fairly full in body, while the red-fruit flavors are solid and familiar. Has good structure and a linear finish. Good in its class.
Like the Josephshöfer bottling, von Kesselstatt's 2009 GG from the Piesporter Goldtröpfchen boasts a salty minerality that underscores the ripe flavors of peach and orange zest. It's medium to full in body, and nearly bone dry, with a long, mouth-watering finish.
This savory Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon blend offers aromas of bell pepper, red currant and plum that carry over to the palate, along with toasted sensations of espresso and oak. Its linear structure will pair well with grilled chicken seasoned with rosemary and grilled vegetables.
Good and dry, with complex layers of blackberries, black cherries, tobacco, herbs and oak. The tannins are wonderfully firm and refined. Suffers a little from excessive acidity, which makes it uncomfortably sharp. Drink now.
Lemberger, also known as Blaufränkisch, was planted here in the 1970s—the winery believes it was the first commercial bottling in the country. This is a seriously good wine, worthy of special attention. It could be mistaken for a particularly fine country wine from Italy, southern France or Spain, with its old vine complexity, red and blue fruits and whiff of tanned leather.
Tinta Roriz, Touriga Franca and Touriga Nacional from two Ramos-Pinto quintas results in a consistently smooth, finely rich wine. It has ripe blackberry fruits that are layered with subtle wood accents and given a great lift by ample acidity. It's a ripe wine, with enough tannins to age for the medium-term, although it can be drunk now.

Jammy aromas and concentrated grape and blackberry flavors pack a lot of fruitiness into this full-bodied and velvet-textured wine. The ripe and almost sweet berry and plum notes gush forth with gusto while the firm, grippy texture keeps the mouthfeel nicely dry and helps clear the palate for the next bite or sip.
Oily-textured wine, flavored with mango and peaches. It's so soft and unctuous that freshness seems to have been left behind. In its place is the ripest fruit giving an open texture and an opulent aftertaste.
From a block of the mighty vineyard known to coax robust acidity and pretty aromatics from the grapes, this red completely delivers on both fronts, opening with an array of rose garden and cranberry-orange highlights. Full bodied and generously structured, it develops complexity in the glass, showing a depth of savory cardamom that's incredibly appealing.
An elegant, medium-bodied Shiraz, with aromas and flavors of red berries and a hint of red peppercorn. Peppery in flavor, yet with smooth, supple tannins. Drink now.
Berry and cassis aromas are a bit raisiny and steer clear of the varietal-based green that Carmenère is known for. This feels ripe and meaty, with ample freshness. Flavors of olive, carob, pepper and black fruits finish clean and a touch hot.
Bright and fresh aromas of Key lime, cantaloupe, light honey and crushed chalk show on the nose of this rarely planted variety, which was bottled by star sommelier Diego Barbieri. It's very dry and tight on the sip, with apple and Asian-pear flavors upheld by a riverstone minerality.
New oak dominates this Chardonnay, along with brisk acidity. Beneath the buttered toast and butterscotch are intensely concentrated tropical fruit flavors. The wine is a little linear now, possibly because the vines are quite young. Give it 2–3 years in the cellar.
At this stage, the wine is all dark structure and very firm. It will need time to develop its full potential as an intensely rich wine. Concentrated and firm, it is powered by tannins as well as sweet red fruits. So age for five years at least.

A Meritage that's 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 50% Merlot, this wine is all leathery pouch—still chewy but with lots of well-intentioned structure and big blackberry flavor.
Winemaker: Marc Kent. A blend of Syrah from Kent's Porseleinberg's Vineyard and an old Stellenbosch vineyard, this is a gripping and young Syrah, begging for some time to mature. Initially, aromas of church incense, fruit cake, licorice and fynbos lead the bouquet, with ripe black cherry and berry fruit at the core. It's rich and robust, with aggressive tannins that lend a gripping texture to the mouthfeel and a bittersweet cocoa astringency to the finish, alongside notes of char and black olive. Drink 2021–2026.
Pure Lodi, very soft, very ripe and slightly sweet. With syrupy flavors of raspberries, cherries, plumped raisins, milk chocolate and licorice, it's balanced with grainy tannins.
Well made, this is a sappy, snappy take on Syrah, with vivid wild berry fruit and lively acids. It snaps into focus right away, then slowly softens as it weaves through the palate, with mixed berries, rhubarb, plum and hints of citrus. The finish lasts a full minute, adding notes of black pepper as it fades. This is beautifully rendered and not overblown in any way, with the alcohol at just 13.5%.
A branded Bordeaux, this shows the structure of the vintage while also being accessible and ready to drink now. It is dominated by Merlot which gives ripe berry fruits and a full, soft structure. Drink now and until 2018. Screwcap.
Lean in build, this is a lovely Riesling for drinking over the near term. It already displays some slightly developed notes of honey and toast alongside lime and crushed stone.
On first whiff, smoky dusty mineral notes on this dry Riesling suggests more earth than fruit. The palate is surprisingly fruity, however, suggesting juicy yellow-peach and citrus flavors anchored against zesty lime acidity. The finish is brisk but refreshing.
From the vineyard's choicest blocks. There's so much going on here, it's hard to know where to begin. Explosive in grilled meats, blackberries, plum jam, licorice, coffee, chocolate, caramel, black pepper and Chinese 5 spice, yet bone dry, with smooth, rich tannins. Extraordinarily good now, and should develop in interesting ways. Certainly one of the best California Syrahs of the last few vintages.
A rich wine, with some wood flavors, and intense ripe, creamy fruit. Flavors of baked apples, of pears and ripe acidity give this wine both structure and density.
This wine's peach, melon and flowers aromas are bright. The palate is dry and fleshy with a bitter note that distracts.
Luxuriously ripe black currant and plum flavors are layered in savory tones of beetroot, herb and green leaves in this full-bodied Cabernet Franc. Brisk acidity and ripe tannins frame the palate neatly. It's approachable yet nuanced, finishing with subtle hint of violet candy.
Made in an old-fashioned Paso Robles style, this is pretty sweet, soft and simple. There's not much complexity, but it has plenty of ripe blackberry, cherry and spice flavors.
An extremely rich texture, like pear juice, and sweet flavors of ripe pear, peach and pineapple give this wine a big personality. It has no apparent crispness to balance it out and keep it lively. All that sweetness and richness suggest a good pairing with salty cheeses.
This is and properly dry, with smooth tannins and high acidity that lends some sting to the palate. The berry and earth flavors lack some intensity. Drink now.
Scheurebe, a Riesling hybrid common in Germany and Austria, is a rare find stateside, particularly in dry styles. Zesty lime pith and pineapple flavors are brisk and revitalizing in this light-bodied sip. A touch of fresh herbs and white-tea astringency lend nuance to the crisp finish.
Smoke, toast and red fruit flavors come together gracefully in this approachable Bordeaux blend. There are plenty of aromas and flavors to contemplate—think roasted lamb and black fruit—but overall the wine is one you can feel comfortable savoring with a big bowl of stew or a plate of cheese. The price is right, too.
In the far north of the Haut-Médoc, Château Coufran is under the same ownership as Verdigan. It has perhaps a more austere character than its stablemate, with also more potential for aging. The fruit is structured and solid, a very textured wine.
This ripe-feeling wine is packed with yellow fruits that give a rounded texture. The rich fruits are also cut with acidity that has a steely, crisp edge, and a chalky texture. It's a wine to age, so drink from 2017.
The phenomenal 2010 vintage shows why this wine is considered Italy's top purebred Merlot. Revealing structure, finesse and mesmerizing depth, it delivers blackberries, currants, cedar, exotic spices and mocha alongside firm, polished tannins and fresh acidity. It's well balanced with fantastic length and while it's delicious now, hold for more complexity. Drink 2015–2030.
This is an elegant Syrah, blended with 18% Mourvèdre and topped with a splash of Grenache. Good phenolic ripeness along with substantial sugars lead into flavors that have melded nicely. Berry, truffle, chocolate, leather, pepper and coffee are all in the mix, and the mid-palate is delicious. Only a fairly quick fade keeps the score from climbing even higher.
This wine has just about the lightest pink color possible, very tempting floral and cherry aromas, and vibrant, mouthwatering cherry and grapefruit flavors. It's essentially light in body but so alive with fruit that it will drink well with almost any dish.
One of two wines produced by this estate from old vines, this is a ripe, full wine that has a fine balance between ripe red-berry fruit and acidity. Spice from the wood aging gives an extra complexity to what is already a delicious wine. Drink from 2017.
This deceptive wine looks almost Pinot-like in color, but packs a myriad of flavors into its compact and raw frame. Rose petals, pomegranate, sour cherry, hints of cumin and nutmeg—it just keeps on going. Tannins are beautifully polished and the wine slowly unfolds, adding layers of flavor. Should improve for six to eight years and cellar for even longer.
This Muscat is the color of dark coffee, with a greenish inflection at the rim, showing the high average age of the blend. It is incredibly rich and sweet—it pretty much oozes across the palate with intense flavors of molasses and dried dates before finishing long, long, long. A wine you can still taste minutes after spitting or swallowing.
This 2008 holdover shows a mix of jammy, composed berry aromas as well as staunch notes of dried cheese and leather. The palate is firm at first, then more loamy and layered. On the flavor profile, baked berry blends with brine and cardamom, while on the finish this ready-to-drink RDD delivers licorice and earthy baked notes.
The nose of this succulent Rosso opens with red berry, candied cherry and blackberry tar. Its firm tannins give the wine a textured, almost gritty, mouthfeel.
Enticing scents of acacia flower, chopped herb and yellow pear waft out of the glass. The juicy, delicious palate offers ripe apple, succulent white peach and citrus alongside fresh acidity. Almond and a light flinty note back up the lingering finish.
Smells ripe, with honey and pear aromas that fold in apples and tangerines. The apples and pears continue on the palate, accented by baking spices—cinnamon, clove and allspice or nutmeg. The acidity is low, making this a candidate to drink now with your favorite Asian cuisine.
This red blend has a nose of fresh cherry, red plum and clove. In the mouth, it offers a combination of fruit and spice flavors featuring anise, black plum, Chinese five spice, and black cherry. There is a burst of still-youthful acidity on the finish, but this should be drunk within the next year or two.
Heavy and waxy, with overdone varietal aromas that seem oily. Lots of pepper and cumin, but what about the fruit and acidity? Nowhere to be found.
This all-stainless Dolcetto is anchored in pretty strawberry fruit and vivid acidity. It looks and tastes like a particularly deep rosé, or perhaps a lighter Beaujolais. Quite charming and delicious.
Sleek, elegant and refined, this is a subtle, evocative and seamless wine. Layers of plum and black cherry, cola and earth, sea salt and caramel entwine gracefully. The 18 months in oak brings in sweet baking spices. Delicious already, it should drink very well at least through 2025.
Very sweet in black cherry and chocolate flavors, basically a Port-style wine, yet too soft, with a melted candybar feeling. Would benefit from greater acidic structure, but it sure is delicious.
Acidity marks this mouth watering wine. It's crisp and tart, providing balance to the slightly sweet flavors of pineapple and apricot jam. Good price for a Sauvignon Blanc of this popular style.
Drinkable and very generic in taste, this medium bodied wine has little varietal character and a broad, soft texture.
This fine marriage of site and winemaker shows experience and intuition at work, presenting a full-bodied, lush and plush expression of tremendous depth and complexity. It offers notes of tart apple, licorice and a wealth of orange zest, which adds a touch of citrusy crispness to the naturally buoyant minerality and nuanced oak. It has much more to share; drink now through 2020.
It offers ripe but restrained yellow plums and a citrusy and textured midpalate focused on lees and acidity. With just the right amount of weight and lightness, it manages that tightrope walk between rounded body and tingling acidity.
Hearty, rustic and full throttle (at 15% alcohol), this is a bottle full of Sicilian fruits and flavors. Figs and dates, raisins and allspice, coffee and dark chocolate whirl through the palate, with the alcohol leaving a distinct trail through the finish. You might consider this in place of a dessert liqueur, served up with stuffed figs, walnuts and the bitterest of chocolate.
A single-clone, single-block cuvée, this is nonetheless complete and satisfying. Blackberry and black cherry fruit are dusted with cinnamon and allspice. A vein of cola and a whiff of sandalwood add further complexity. More elegant than powerful, this retains its balance through a medium-long finish.
This is a frothy, creamy Prosecco that forms a thick layer of foam and is redolent of peach and lemon meringue. Drying minerals and compact linearity characterize the mouthfeel, and the sparkler leaves the palate sparkling clean.
High alcohol gives this wine a chili pepper heat, and the fruit isn't quite strong enough to balance it. The result is a wine whose berry flavors feel hot. Ready to drink now.
This is a smooth, ripe wine that's just beginning to mellow. The flavors of toast and cashew are opulent, with just a touch of spice. It has weight and a finish that shows both acidity and richness.
This is a structured wine, firmly tannic and with considerable wood flavors at this stage. Plenty of rich fruit lies in the background, giving promise for the future. With those red berry flavors and fine acidity in place, this will be a solid, dense wine. Drink from 2018.
This is a densely concentrated wine with lush and traditional notes of apple-cherry, cherry liquor, black chocolate and spice cake. What you notice most in the mouth is the wine's almost excessive sweetness that is well framed within a context of firm tannins and good length. Imported by Wine Wave.
Riserva Vigna Castellero is an approachable and elegant food wine with focused aromas of wild berry and cassis, backed by mineral, cola and powdered licorice. There's a polished and fine nature to the mouthfeel and the wine would stand up to juicy filet mignon topped with foie gras and mushroom pâté.
Classic Petite Sirah, in the full-bodied richness, dryness, hard tannins and deep flavors of ripe dark berries and fruits, cocoa, grilled meat and black pepper. As good as that is, it also shows the impeccable balance of a fine Napa Valley red wine. Good now with robust meat stews and roasts, and it should develop for many years.
Pinched austere aromas of cat pee and oily sweat are extreme and unusual for a Rías Baixas wine. A citric and raw palate tastes like this smells. Fresh acidity is about all this underripe, sour and bitter blend of Albariño, Treixadura and Loureira has going for it.
From the vineyard on the slope above Château Pavie, this is a beautiful, juicy and ripe wine. It has a mineral character with great swathes of black-currant fruit. This is a very fine wine, well delineated, ripe and with a delicious red-currant aftertaste. Drink from 2026.
Exuding seductive perfumes, this is a luxuriant Pinot Noir. The red berry fruits are lifted by bright, fresh acidity and a delicious smoky edge on the finish.
The 16% by volume alcohol on this Zin is high even by Wilson's standards. It gives the wine a burn that it does not wear well. The body and flavors aren't rich enough to carry the heat, the way that a proper Port can. Richly-sauced barbecue is your best bet for food pairing.
This is a powerful and concentrated wine. It is full of dusty, dark tannins that are still masking the rich blackberry and black currant fruits. There is a dry core here that will fill out as the wine matures. It's a serious, long-lasting wine that needs aging. Drink from 2018.
Made of 70% Trebbiano, 15% San Colombano and 15% Sangiovese, this savory dessert wine opens with fig, maple syrup and caramel aromas. The complex palate delivers chestnut honey, toasted almond and candied date flavors, while a hint of dried tangerine accents the lingering finish.
This opens with hard-capped aromas of crusty mineral and reedy berry. The flavors are gamy and roasted, with brandied plum and cherry accents. The finish is bright in feel and runs long with an herbal raspberry flavor.
A full-on Bordeaux blend, with 61% Cab Sauvignon, 19% Merlot, 11% Cab Franc and 9% Petit Verdot. Tight and slatey, it's got firm, hard—but certainly ripe—tannins wrapped around concentrated cassis and mulberry fruit. It's very well made but can use some softening up; a few more years will add to its complexity and develop its bouquet.
The winery's regular Edna Valley Pinot was quite good, but this single-vineyard bottling, which shares many of its qualities, suffers from an apparent sweetness that makes it cloying. It's hard to figure out how this got past the winemaker.
Very berry, with sour candy scents and cooked red fruit flavors floating over a base of seasoned leather. Juicy, medium finish. Drink up.
Really sweet and unctuous in texture, this pale copper-hued Muscat is a blend of white- and dark-skinned grapes. Peach and berry flavors are balanced by a spicy, green-herb tinge to the finish.
Reserved fruit and spice flavors, and a soothing, gripping texture will make this medium-bodied blend of Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon a great dinner guest. Plenty of tannins give a fine sandpaper feel on the tongue, and the wine will counterbalance the richness of meat, fowl and game dishes.
A new label for MacMurray Ranch, this Pinot Gris is stony in fresh nectarine, pear and mango, wrapped in a creamy texture that develops fleshy flavors of fig in the glass. The fruit is sourced from both MacMurray Ranch and Gallo's cooler Russian River Valley outpost, Two Rock, near Petaluma.
By heating part of the must before vinification, Jean-Luc Baldès has revived the medieval way of making Cahors, when it was know as the black wine. It gives, literally, black colored wine, with flavors of stewed prunes allied to intense, dry tannins. Red berries add freshness, but this is more jelly, cooked fruits and darkness.
There are a lot of uncommon, unusual elements to this Pinot. For starters, the nose is volatile, with notes of horseradish and grapefruit. The palate has a solid, juicy feel to it, while mulchy cherry and plum flavors finish aimlessly.
Red rose, mature wild berry, dark cooking spice and a balsamic note are some of the aromas you'll find on this gorgeous wine. The structured, elegant palate delivers juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry, licorice pipe tobacco and mocha balanced by firm, silky tannins and surprising freshness for the vintage.
Enticing aromas of chocolate-cherry cake blend seamlessly with meat, earth and baking spices. The tannins are chewy but fine grained and beautifully balanced. Tart cherries and savory olive linger on the finish. Drink now–2024.
What a nice Pinot this is. It's not only easy to drink, it's complex in the interplay of fruit, acids and oak. There are black and red cherries, pomegranates, sweet rhubarb pie, mocha and spicebox flavors, wrapped in an elegantly silky package. The finish is deep and long.
Very floral and obvious on the nose, but also very light and fresh on the palate, without any overpowering weight or sugar. Clean and dry on the finish, with lingering notes of flowershop greens and a hint of white pepper.
Composed berry, spice, herb and oak aromas are complete and inviting. In the mouth, this is ripe and dense, with chewy tannins. Blackberry, mixed herb and dark chocolate flavors are integrated, while this settles nicely on the finish.
Creamy yellow plum fruit and a flinty edge lead onto a full-fruited, brightly lit palate where all the fruit is pulled into zesty orange and lemon focus. Concentration and friendliness prove great assets here.
Savory notes of crushed chervil and yeast join lively, almost fizzing notes of lemon zest. This is ultrafresh, light-footed and very toned. Juicy, ripe acidity animates you to drink this almost as a thirst-quencher. This will work on a hot, sunny evening.
One of the better Roussannes out there, this is dry with balanced acidity, showing a creamy mouthfeel, plus complex citrus, butterscotch, mineral and spice flavors. It has many food-pairing possibilities.
This is a lovely wine to drink now. It's so dry and elegantly constructed, with wonderfully ripe tannins and great integration of oak with the fruit. There's a nice balance of acidity to balance the blackberry, cherry and cola flavors. Drink now, with a brief decant.
Low key aromas concentrate on peach and melon with some exotic fruit. In the mouth, the wine is supple and graceful, but it's also rather neutral. Try it with falafel. Imported by Italian Wine Growers.
This 100% Syrah from sunny coastal Tuscany offers extreme softness and richness with chocolate, cherry liqueur, blueberry and smoked bacon fat. Pair this rich wine with game meat or stew.
Rose petal, underbrush, grilled herb and game aromas take shape in the glass along with a balsamic note. On the firm full-bodied palate, hints of baking spice accent ripe (almost overripe) morello cherry and raspberry. Close-grained tannins give it an assertive finish. It's already almost accessible. Drink 2021–2028.
This Freixenet brand consists of 100% Xarello grapes, and it's nice on the nose and clean as a whistle. Flavors of apple cider, peach and melon are subdued and a bit sweet, while the feel is juicy and tightly wrapped. Nice for a Catalonian white table wine. Imported by Freixenet, USA.
Aromas of lemon, white flower and white stone fruit lead the nose while the bright, juicy bright palate offers pear, peach and nectarine zest. A note of white almond caps off the finish.
Immediately appealing, this trendsetting Malbec proudly cranks out blackberry and spice aromas that are on the spot. Full and tannic on the palate, but not too fierce, this tastes of bold, earthy plum and black raspberry with savory notes kicking in. A long, tightly wound finish with well-integrated oak means this will last. Drink through 2022.
From vines just below the line of Grand Cru vineyards, this is a big and powerful expression of Pinot Noir. It is dense with firm tannins that are embedded in the ripe black fruits. It's a complex wine, serious while still fruity, and needing to age. Drink from  2018.
A 100% Alvarinho from this small, 34-acre estate near Monsão. This is a delicious, fresh wine, with great piercing acidity and bright pink grapefruit flavors. Imported by Grape Expectations (CA).
With one year in large oak casks, this bright Rosso di Montalcino is both refined and sophisticated. Rich concentration helps give the wine persistency and power. Aromas here include black cherry, dried currants, cola, dried herbs and mesquite wood.
This is a dark, plush Saint-Joseph, not an edgy, wiry, herb-scented version. Superripe plum and licorice notes are framed by soft tannins and hints of baking spices, but the wine' essential Syrah nature comes through on the dusty pepper-and-anise finish. Drink now–2020.
It smells of apple pie, pears and spearmint. Tastes of pineapple, green apple and oak. Some residual sugar lends a fruit-cocktail element to a wine that shows its best when well chilled. As it warms up it begins to get sticky on the palate.
Lemon peel, grapefruit and yellow apples constitute the fruit here, with minimal impact from aging in 20% new French oak. The wine is stylish and the acid-driven flavors penetrating. It's a fine food wine.
The color and weight on this Spanish Cabernet are just right. After that, it becomes an insider's wine. Why do we say that? Because it's not like a Napa, Washington or Chilean Cabernet that oozes cassis, plum and sweet French oak. Instead, it shows the terroir of the Mas La Plana vineyard in northeast Spain, and with airing (decanting even better) it becomes a sexy, interesting, Old World Cabernet that delivers provoking, earthier flavors. And it should age well for another decade.
Very ripe, rich, structured wine, exuding power and concentration. It is packed with red fruits and damsons, creating a juicy character and tense mineral acidity. A magnificent wine, for aging.
One of the better examples in this category, this is crisp and clean. It has a hint of tannin and a green edge from the only just-ripe grapes. The strawberry flavor at the end does bring an attractive aftertaste.
White pepper and a floral nose pique interest right away in this wine. A relatively light-bodied expression of the grape, it's soft in body and texture that persists in flavors of cinnamon stick.
Savory and deep given the price, with dark color, obvious ripeness and even a touch of vanilla and mocha on the nose. Round in the mouth and immensely fruity, with plum and berry flavors blending with vanilla. Textured and medium-long on the finish. Good for everyday quaffing, especially in the cold fall and winter months.
I quickly run out of superlatives for this spectacular wine. It is satiny and saturated with pure, clean Syrah flavors, the fruit dancing from plum to   mulberry to pie cherry, laced with smoke and white pepper. Fine grained tannins ride the finish, which continues to send up little spice flares as it lingers in the back of the throat. This is a wine anyone would be proud to call their own.
Bold berry and earth aromas are the lead in to this well-structured, honest Ribera red. It's a bit tannic and rough now, but solidly built, with black fruit, minty spice and peppery flavors. The finish is dry, fairly oaky and long enough to show modest complexity. Drink now–2015.
Soft strawberry and cherry aromas, ripe fruit flavors and a sense of lushness make this a mouthfilling and full-bodied wine. It oozes fruit flavors that spread across the tongue and linger almost like jam on the finish.
There's a good Pinot in here waiting to get out, and three or four years may do it. Young and angular, with ripe cherry fruit and a rich earthiness suggesting sweet pipe tobacco, this well-oaked wine is dry, with an elegant, silky texture.
Tilled soil, iris, violet, black plum and tobacco aromas come together on this classically crafted blend of Sangiovese, Colorino and Mammolo. The structured, balanced palate delivers black cherry, licorice, ground pepper, leather and grilled herb alongside youthfully austere tannins. It's still tightly knit so give it time to fully develop and bloom. Drink 2017–2027.
Soft, velvety and oaky, a gentle wine with polished flavors of blackberries, cherries, milk chocolate and cinnamony spices. Not a cellar candidate, but delicious tonight and through 2005.
A sound everyday wine with some special features. Although it's a bit sharp, it shows nice flavors of black cherries, cola and oak, wrapped into fine, intricate tannins.
Dried strawberries, wild berries, cloves cinnamon and cocoa powder power the nose on this bottling from a vineyard named after a famous composer who once owned the property. There's not much fruit on the palate, just a touch of dried black cherries, but plenty of dried herbs, milk and dark chocolate and mocha-cappuccino flavors. It's a touch hot.
Viscous, almost oily in texture, this is several vintages older than most of the recent samples, yet seems so unevolved that it's not out of place. Honey and dried spices are the predominant themes, with citrusy fruit making up the core. Should evolve glacially through at least 2025.
This has somewhat acrid aromas of animal and farmyard, while the palate offers a very ripe plum flavor that's just short of being overripe, as well as vanilla and chocolate sensations. It finishes on a bitter note.
Shows good varietal character, with cola, cherry and pomegranate flavors grounded with earthier notes of rhubarb and tobacco. Feels a bit soft in structure, lacking liveliness, so drink up now.
This is a strongly flavored young wine. There's nothing subtle about the blast of blackberries, cherries and currants, of the sweet, smoky oak. The tannins are pronounced, giving a dusty astringency in the mouth. Should develop for 2–4 years.
A very nice Cab, a little dry and brittle by itself, but with a rich core of black currants, cherries and herbs framed in rich tannins. All it needs is a good steak to make it sing.
Medium weight with soft, dusty tannins, this wine is easily approachable now. Juicy and jammy flavors of red berry preserves are complemented by nuances of iris. A straightforward wine that will pair nicely with most game-based dishes.
Made with organically farmed grapes, this delicious white opens with aromas of citrus blossom and white stone fruit. The tangy, medium-bodied palate offers a lovely depth of flavors that include juicy tangerine, lime, white peach, bitter almond and mineral. Crisp acidity brightens the rich flavors and carries through to the clean finish.
Dominated by steely, crisp Chardonnay, this is fresh, tight and full of citrus and zesty fruits. A mineral edge gives a nervy texture as well as fragrant fruitiness. The bottling could well age: fresh for now, more toasty and with greater depth later.
Gritty earthy aromas come up short on freshness and clarity. This feels raw and pinching, with dry rubbing tannins. Gritty peppery berry flavors are oaky, while this finishes with savory berry, herb and tobacco flavors. Hammering tannins suggest decanting and/or service with hearty foods.
Beautifully crafted, aromatic, high-toned but not over the top. Plummy, pretty cherry fruit, lightly spiced and showing a bit of chocolate as it breathes. In this freeze year the crop was reduced by two thirds; just 289 cases were produced.
This wine is tight, mineral and nervy. It misses out on fruitiness, giving a strongly textured character that has an austere aftertaste. Drink from 2016.
Polished and balanced, this masterpiece shows restraint and it's already drinkable. With its great acidity and its fine intermingling of spice and red fruit flavors, this wine will appeal to lovers of Gamay and Pinot Noir.
Fragrant and spicy, this savory wine delivers aromas of ripe black cherry, blackberry and white pepper that carry over to the palate. It's balanced with fresh acidity while soft, polished tannins give a smooth, easy-drinking texture.
Blended from Yarra Valley and King Valley fruit, this light-bodied Pinot Noir is silky in texture, with a lingering finish. Modest red fruit combines with earthier notes of parsnip. Drink now.
Based in Epernay, this Champagne house specializes in bone-dry Champagnes. Like this bottling, they need some time before the acidity calms down. This has the potential to be delicious, crisp, and full of a bright mineral texture and citrus fruitiness. Drink from 2018.
A little on the soft side, with candied raspberry, cherry and cola flavors, but at this price, it's a decent starter Pinot Noir for those who are curious about this red-hot variety but don't want to spend a bundle. Enjoy the silkiness and spice.
This medium-bodied Pinot Grigio blends underripe pear notes with hints of nasturtium and flintiness, while a hint of bitterness emerges on the finish. Overall, it's clean, correct and refreshing.
A barrel selection of lots the winery has to choose from, this is Failla's highest priced Pinot. It's clearly a very fine wine, dry, crisp in coastal acidity and complex. The flavors now range from cherries and currants to cola and tomato juice, wrapped into firm tannins. Not showing delicacy or opulence now, but a Pinot Noir to cellar. Better after 2013.
This blends together grapes from several vineyard sites in three AVAs. It opens with a bouquet of milk chocolate and mocha, leading to a tart cranberry flavor. There's are hints of herb and bark in the finish. This is designed (successfully) as a fruit-driven, drink-now style of Oregon Pinot.
Nice flavor concentration and light body make this wine a standout. It starts with vivid black cherry aromas that lead to riper, almost-sweet cherry and blackberry flavors. The texture is structured with moderate tannins that keep the flavors going through the finish.
The Napa-Sonoma winery, straddled across two counties, has added 12% Cabernet Sauvignon to the Cab Franc in this wine. The result is sizable in ripe, blueberry and blackberry fruit, soft tannins and a finish of dark chocolate. Void of any of the variety's signature herbaceous signature, it could easily be mistaken for Cabernet Sauvignon.
Weighty and rich, but the melon core to this Uruguayan Viognier is solid. The palate pumps round apple with walnut shadings, and the finish goes to melon, papaya and banana. It's already aging and won't last for long; get it while it's still good.
Seems less fruity and clean than in the past, with earthy, damp, charred aromas and herbal notes. It's hard and scratchy on the palate, with rough, herbal flavors of red berries and currant. Shows a distinct tomato/herbal character on the finish.
This big, jammy Syrah is packed with spice, baked plum and blackberry aromas. In the mouth, it's wide and voluminous. Flavors of blackberry are fully ripe, while blueberry and pepper flavors are long and lasting on the finish.
This approachable wine from the Fetzer organization was aged in Bourbon barrels. It has good balance, wonderful fruit flavors, a polished texture and lingering finish. Dark in color, the aromas suggest ripe berries and cherries, and the flavors flow similarly rich and deep.
A gigantic, tannic monster of a Zin with full fruit flavors of cranberry, ripe plum and plenty of oak. Well-made for certain, with cigar and licorice.
Winemakers Dan Rosenberg and Bob Bossi have dialed this wine in. While not very deep in color, it packs an incredible amount of spicy, meaty notes into the aroma and an even greater amount of ripe, luscious fruit and spice flavors into the palate. It's a gentle giant that oozes with oak accents recalling cedar, cinnamon and vanilla that sink nicely into its plump cherry and plum flavors.
Very dark and inky in color, this bottling by Matthias Pippig shows baked black plum and black cherry on the nose as well as a dusting of cocoa and elegant forest spices of juniper and pine. More baked plum and rich blueberry show on the palate, but with a considerably earthy edge of black tea, juniper, coffee and dark chocolate.
Red Mountain is not especially known for its Gewürztraminer other than the late harvest wines from Kiona. Here it has been blended with 12% Marsanne, resulting in a spicy, off-dry (1.4 residual sugar), rather yeasty wine.
Musky and leathery at first, with a hint of cough drop. And it never really gains its legs. The palate shows a pruny character along with some wayward acidity, while the finish is indifferent. Adequate but lacks elegance and appeal.
Very fruity in flavor and smooth in texture, this Rhône-style blend of 67% Grenache with Mourvèdre and Syrah is easy to enjoy. It is full-bodied, feels rich and mouth-filling on the palate and remains light in tannins and acidity.
Ultratight cherry and plum aromas create a lean red fruit profile. The palate is extra crisp and sheer, with piercing raspberry then a wash of oak flavor. Paper thin on the finish, with freshening acids and a final blast of oak.
A bit sweet in fruit juice flavors, but nice and crisp, with a fine minerality. Suggests pineapples, peaches and vanilla, with a sugary finish.
This is a finely made wine, fresh and crisp. It is dry but with a soft texture that turns it into a wine that's both good with food and as an apéritif. The aftertaste is crisp and still fruity.
The fruit is soft and faded in this wine, which is otherwise soft-medium in body,. It's made by a longstanding producer of Petite Sirah and Cabernet Sauvignon.
As they begin to mature, it's good to be reminded of the 1996 vintage. The initial austerity is now blossoming into finely balanced wines, even though the acidity is always going to be a dominant factor. This wine is still young, in fact, still with its fresh fruits, only just showing some mineral and toast character. Age for 10 years or more.
The quality of the 2009 vintage is reflected in this value-priced Toro that's full and medicinal but also balanced and rewarding. Flavors of medicinal red-berry fruit are mixed with thicker, chocolaty notes, while the finish is bold, grabby and solid. A blend of Tempranillo and Garnacha.
This is pure Sangiovese, from the estate vineyard. This captures the varietal character nicely, with very pretty cherry and cranberry fruit, high acids, and a bright, accessible style. It tastes like young vines, but shows enormous potential, with a pleasing earthiness to the finish. The first Sangio from Barrister.
A lovely Cabernet, rich and ripe in blackberries and cassis, with a touch of herbs and a little heat from high alcohol. A good steak, with its salty fattiness, will take care of that. But it's tannic. Not so much that you can't drink it now, but it really wants a year or two in the cellar.
Full-bodied and rustic, a simple wine to drown pasta with sausages and marinara sauce. It's dry and gritty, with blackberry, mulberry and pepper flavors.
Medium, almost full, in weight but mildly flavored for its heft. Offers up delicate talc and lemondrop aromas, with pear skin flavors dominating on the palate. After a few sips, limey-citrus flavors step in and take over. 1,500 cases produced.
Mysteriously smoky on the nose, with an earthy sheen of crushed stones and steel. Just off-dry and fairly lean in style, it's surprisingly penetrating on the palate, with crisp lime and white peach flavors that linger.
This wine balances ripeness with crispness. There is a spice note as well as a smooth texture that will round out further as the wine develops over the next four years..
A racy, balanced type of Cabernet with aromas of graphite, black cherry and plum. That's followed by a fit palate with Cab-related weight and tannins but also a lightness of being. Tastes lightly herbal, but with plenty of red plum and berry notes and length. Juicy and fresh overall.
Chalky and thin, this shows no particular varietal character. It looks as if it's already fading, and flavors taste woody and dull. Two bottles tasted; same notes.
Smoke, honey and delicate white flowers meld luxuriously on this not-quite-dry beauty. Sweet white grapefruit juice flavors are intensely concentrated on the palate, highlighted by a shower of lime zest and a stony minerality on the finish.
This wine has too much alcohol, namely 15.8%, and finishes hot and raisiny. Awkward exaggerations of what Zin should be.
Made using skin contact to give extra intensity to the fruit flavor and structure, this is a ripe and full wine. It has creamed apple and pineapple flavors, with tangy acidity that bursts like berries on the palate. Drink this impressive wine from late 2016.
Took its time to emerge from the glass, then settled into a lovely, rich and complex wine, with plenty of dark fruit, an earthy, floral core, nice balance and a medium finish.
A late Merlot harvest (October 19) from 22 acres, the wine was stored for 12–16 months in cement vats. Dry and extracted with a hard edge that dulls the fruit, the wine will likely stay that way.
A barnyard aroma and ripe black fruit are the hallmarks of this young wine. Bottled without sulfur, it's packed with blackberry flavors and soft tannins. It's all fruit and spice, with only light tannins. Drink now.
Apricots, ripe peaches and honey make an irresistible combination. The wine is ripe, showing some botrytis flavors as well as delicious fruitiness. The acidity that comes through gives a fresh while sweet aftertaste.
A wine for the faithful, this is tasty and light bodied. It does a nice job of combining fresh, fruity aromas with appealing black-cherry flavors and a moderately tannic, appetizing texture.
This shows a ripe and earthy flavor component, silky texture and lingering finish. It has aromas like flowers, leather and currants, then it offers black cherry, clove and cinnamon flavors, a rich mouthfeel and moderate tannins. Full bodied but smooth at the same time.
This bright and delicious wine is everything a young Morellino should be. It delivers juicy black cherry, white pepper and clove flavors alongside firm but ripe tannins and soft acidity. Made for everyday pleasure, this isn't an ager so enjoy now.
Ripe pear and yellow plum vie for prominence on the nose, while the palate is full of savory, peppery kitchen herbs like chervil, lovage and dried sage. The midpalate phenolic texture destines this for the table where it will shine with subtly spiced dishes. Wonderfully complex and long.
Sweet-leaning aromas of apple, nectarine and mandarin orange are cut by a wet-cement aroma on the nose of this bottling. It's light and easy in style on the palate, with lime rind and chalk flavors. It's altogether quite mellow but very refreshing and quaffable.
Dryly fruited, this light and flavorful Monastrell (aka Mourv¡edre) blend is a winning, easy drinker. Clean and direct, with dry cherry licorice and mineral shadings, it's a simple and satisfying mouthful, great for patio dining with lighter grilled foods. Best Buy. —M.M.
A simple, rustic Zinfandel, sweet and fruity in cherry jam, red licorice, bacon and spice flavors, wrapped into robust tannins. The grapes were sourced from Sonoma, Mendocino and Lodi.
Simple and rough in texture, with medicinal citrus fruit and dough flavors.
This is a blend of Chenin Blanc and Viognier that's zesty in acidity and slightly sweet in honeyed flavor. Immensely fruity, it bears notes of orange, green apple, lime and vanilla. A versatile wine to drink with today's spectrum of ethnic fare.
100 percent To Kalon [including Detert and Horton]. Similar to the ‘91.  Rather stubborn at first. The fruit  is there, the balance, acidity, oak, but hasn't knitted together. Disjointed but distinguished. Could really surprise later on. 2010 and beyond.
Beautiful, ripe fruit flavors light up this full-bodied but silky-textured wine. It leaves an almost-sweet impression, as layers of blackberry, raspberry and strawberry coat the palate and linger on the finish. The texture is almost syrupy because the wine is so rich, making it a great pairing for chocolate or aged cheese.
Grace and elegance mark this Pinot, and so does plenty of power. It shows concentrated raspberry essence, cherry tart and drier, tart cranberry flavors, with oak adding richer, sweeter notes of buttered toast. Brisk acidity and soft tannins provide structure. Beautiful now, and should continue to develop over the next 6–8 years.
Aged a mere five months in oak, this fresh offering is nutty and expansive on the palate, presenting brawny, full-bodied pineapple and anise flavors. Concentrated and ripe, it's for fans of the style.
With its high wood aromas and high toast on the palate, this is a wine that has leached out the fruit for the moment. It is austere, mineral, leaving the black fruits very secondary for the next three years. The finish, though, has promising juiciness.
Stash this in the cellar for a while, because even though it's well over three years old, it's still a big, immature wine. Dry and tannic, it explodes with jammy blackberries, cherries, chocolate, cola, licorice, orange zest and pepper flavors, wrapped into sweet, smoky oak. The parts should begin to come together by the end of 2009.
Raspberry, herb and sugared-plum aromas are followed by easy-drinking red-fruit flavors that show a sense of balance that keeps the interest high.
The wine is hard with little sign of potential juicy fruit at this stage. There is a tarry, dry character, firm and not balanced.
Surprisingly rich and nuanced for such an inexpensive wine, it has balanced aromas and flavors of blackberries, pepper and earth. Has the finesse and complexity of red wines costing a lot more. —S.H.
Saturated aromas of black currant and blueberry are nuanced with wood smoke, herb and mint notes. This feels ripped and tannic, but balanced, with toasty flavors of blackberry, cassis, herb and espresso. It's persistent on the finish; drink now–2015.
Perfumed, with dark chocolate and solid fruit flavors. It's quite foursquare, with black intensity, but a simple structure.
This is a structured wine, almost tannic in character. It has a rich, textured character that will allow the wine well. Apple and pear flavors are dominant along with the spice from wood aging. Drink from 2020.
Graphite, molasses, foresty notes and briny leather are the prime aromas on this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Carmenère and Petit Verdot. The mouthfeel is layered and fairly deep, with a firm structure and strong tannins. Roasted black-fruit flavors come with pepper and toast, while the finish offers even more pepper, olive and tobacco notes.
While there are wood aromas, this has enough rich black fruits to balance the toasty, caramel character. It is still firm and tannic, but in the next two years it will become a solid, rich wine.
Lightweight, very herbal Sauvignon Blanc, full of green fruits, lemon zest and refreshing acidity. Ready to drink, it finishes as fresh as can be. Screwcap.
This is part of a range which returns to origins, with wood fermentation for the wines. Perfumed, green initially and then showing flavors of lychees and earthiness, this has some oak toast, but more of an open flavor from light (and pleasing) oxidation.
Something seems afoot with Sur de los Andes' so-called Gran Reserva Malbecs. Both the 2004 and epecially this '05 are wines that don't handle their oak well. This wine has an aromatic package of green tobacco and ash, while the wood burns its way through the palate. A rough ride that gets marginally better with a lot of swirling and patience.
One of two Byron bottlings from this source; this one should be less difficult to find in stores. The dry apple and pear fruit flavors are bolstered by crisp acidity, refreshing mineral accents and earthy elements. This is a chewy, mouthfilling wine with richly textured palate feel. The long finish is tangy with citrus, cinnamon and mineral components.
This blend of the Cyprian Ofthalmo, Mourvèdre and Cabernet Sauvignon has strange aromas of prune, wet grass and beet. But rhubarb flavors and a sweetness hide the tannins and gives it a smooth feel.
From Sonoma and Napa-grown grapes, this white combines fresh peach and apricot flavor with a taste of grapefruit and fresh-squeezed lime. Through the middle it veers into vanilla and tropical swirls, before finishing crisp.
This very light, thin Merlot shows modestly ripe fruit and fairly substantial tannins, perhaps from the addition of 16% Petit Verdot. Flavors are herbal and the finish fades quickly.
A light and pleasant blend of 70% Nero d'Avola and 30% Cabernet. The bouquet features red raspberry, fresh tomato and crushed spice. Flavors of berry jam and chocolate are easy to like, while the finish is warm and textured. With proper grip and lively, sticky tannins, this is no weakling.
Still the most impressive Pinot in Argentina, the #32 car is showing a purple color and lots of young oak, menthol and leather on the nose. The palate is lush, deep and cushioned, while the flavors are youthful but revolve around black cherry and ripe plum. A toasty, dark, modern wine with a lovely, silky, pure texture. Best from 2012–2016.
This Cabernet blend includes about 20% Syrah in the mix, which perhaps contributes to a lack of varietal character. It seems to be in a dumb phase, with no specific aromas and nondescript fruit. The finish turns acidic and chalky.
Upon opening, the wine has scents that are ripe, leafy and slightly pruney, but the flavors come across as light and true. Cherry, fig and plum fruits, somewhat cooked, somewhat candied, mingle in a soft and fruity wine that takes some hours to smooth out. The fruit is both a little too ripe, and a bit green, the tannins green and the finish leafy.
While this bubbly is technically dry, it tastes sweetly infused with the essence of strawberries and vanilla. The mouthfeel is fine, with a gentle scouring of acidity and the slight sourness from its lees. Drink it now with almost anything, especially sushi.
A fine, crisp Sauvignon Blanc, offering lots of sweet citrus fruits, honey and spices that venture into real complexity. The flavors of tangerines, Asian pears, Meyer lemons and green apples are rich and intricate, brightened by fine acidity.
A playful hint of porcino mushroom and earth peeks though aromas of spice, bramble and green spinach leaf. This is a distinctive wine (in gorgeous packaging) that represents a traditional style of Aglianico del Vulture. It tastes raw, gritty and firm in the mouth.
This is one of those likeable Barbaras made to be drunk at release. It works: it is friendly, big, lush, easygoing and fruity.  It may not be taxing, but it is an amiable food friendly faultless wine that cries out for the backyard barbecue.
A good wine that delivers the power you want. It's dry and rich in blackberries, currants, chocolate and smoky cedar. There's a slight rusticity in the form of a tannin-acid inconsistency.
So smooth and lush, it's hard to keep from drinking the whole bottle. Shows wonderfully smooth, sweet blackberries, cherries and raspberries, balanced with supple tannins and fine acidity. Should hold well over the next six years.
Herbal accents grace the black plum and berry aromas and flavors, and a touch of biltong spice and meat mingle with the fruit for added character. Approachable and soft, with delicate tannins and an easy, friendly finish. Drink now.
An intriguing blend of juicy pear and tart but ripe apple perfumes the luminous palate that shines with fruit. The apple tartness, boosted by a little citrus, creates a lovely balance on this easy-drinking, little fruit bomb.
Bergfeld is named for the winery's historic owner and the land he originally planted around the winery in 1873. Given to old-world airs, the wine is chalky in black fruit, tobacco and mocha, as well as soft, substantial tannins. Generous in juiciness and structure, it has an herbal quality on the finish.
Brushy aromas of wild herbs along with cherry and plum scents feed into a fresh, fairly full palate. This is generously oaked for basic Malbec, and thus spice and resin notes share the stage with plum and blackberry flavors. A dry, spicy, resiny finish is the close.
There is a definite caramel and toffee character to this wine, sitting over ripe melon and yellow peach. The texture is dominated by wood, but still shows plenty of creamy baked apples. Good, fine concentration on the finish. Imported by Palm Bay International.
Menetou-Salon is a near neighbor of Sancerre. Its wines are, like this, lighter and leaner than the better-known appellation. This wine displays a soft but herbaceous, grassy character with a steely edge. Drink now.
Forest floor, dark-skinned berry, clove and sage aromas emerge in the glass. The juicy straightforward palate offers wild cherry extract, anise and a hint of pipe tobacco alongside chewy tannins. Drink 2018–2023.
89-91 The wine is all tannins, very severe feeling. The toughness masks the fruit, although there is just a hint of juiciness to finish.
Mostly Cabernet Sauvignon and Sangiovese (with a small touch of Cabernet Franc), Solaia's winning card is texture. The wine is soft, velvety and penetrating in the mouth with succulent flavors of blackberry, creamy cassis berry, chocolate and tobacco. Thick extraction and quality fruit craft a memorable wine that will last many long and happy years in your cellar.
Ripe grapefruit, green plums and other green stone fruits all show that this wine has some weight, allied with a steely interior. Still young, it fills the mouth with yeast and some toast, but more of an intense freshness.
A slightly bitter aroma of citrus or sour spice opens the nose of this Riserva Barbaresco. There's also a hint of dried apple or pear and the wine follows with a tight, lean mouthfeel.
Almost as good as some of the winery's best single-vineyard bottlings, this wine has a tremendous nose that offers tangerine blossom, pink grapefruit skin, sea salt and toast around a line of graphite. The palate presents juicy nectarine and ripe citrus alongside yeasty sizzle, salt and a chalk minerality.
Easygoing and enjoyable, this has aromas of mature black-skinned fruit, violet and an earthy whiff of truffle. The juicy simple palate offers black cherry and a hint of baking spice alongside supple tannins. Drink soon.
This is a big, brawny, tight mix of 51% Grenache, 25% Syrah and 24% Mourvèdre. Zin-like raspberry compote flavor, notes of stone fruit and strong-walled tannins are at the forefront. Musky and earthy, the finish is smooth and long-lasting.
Racy and sleek, this low-alcohol Pinot has a silky transparency that makes it feel just fine in the mouth. The raspberry and cola flavors have a nice hint of smoky oak. Drink now.
A terrific white wine, crisp and smooth in the mouth. The flavors are as complex as they come, offering waves of citrus and tropical fruits, peaches, honeysuckle, vanilla and buttered toast. For all the upfront fruitiness, the finish is nice and dry.

Soft, sweet and simple, with peach, tropical fruit and buttered toast flavors, this Chard will satisfy basic fans of the variety looking for a bargain.
Yes, this does not shy away from the herbal bite often found in Oregon Pinot. But that accent is nicely integrated into a firm, balanced wine with penetrating red fruits and darker notes of black coffee, black licorice and a whiff of fresh truffle.
Ripe blackberry aromas are a touch malty and jammy, with a note of buttered pastry thrown in for good measure. This emphasizes the rich ripe extracted side of Priorat, but balance is not sacrificed. Lush dark toasty black-fruit flavors come with notes of oaky spice and bitter chocolate, while the finish is toasty blackened, deep and chunky. Drink through 2023.
This Grenache, Syrah, Mourvèdre blend has a tart and tangy appeal. The mixed plum and berry fruit flavors are matched with strongly herbal streaks. Tannins are earthy and astringent.
A lovely, lively, brittle wine, its delicate fruit flavors featherlight over the palate. The structure is here, but the acidity and the green, perfumed fruits are more dominant. The aftertaste is bright and fresh.
Opens oakier than the younger '05, with coffee, toffee and mocha aromas along with touches of olive and green tobacco. The wine has a full, robust, tannic feel and deep, sweet berry and cassis flavors. Huge, saturated and rocky due to the tannins, but really good. Cabernet Sauvignon, Carmenère, Monastrell and Tempranillo is the mix.
Named after the delicious perfume that wafts across the vineyards in the evening, Egarade is a fine example of how close in character Crémant de Bourgogne is to many Champagnes. It has just the right steely character, crisp and structured, a very mineral feel to the aftertaste.
A light, choppy wine with rubbery, smoked-meat aromas. The flavors are secondary and deep in the background, while up front its rough, spice-driven, a bit tomatoey and drying.
Showing the rich, exotic side of Viognier, this has ripe, flamboyant flavors of tropical fruit, white flower and spice. It has a controlled dryness and citrusy acidity; this is a lovely, versatile white.

Named after the fourth art of Kama Sutra, this wine shows Juicy Fruit gum aromas as well as banana candies and a squeeze of lemon. There is a lime-pith tension to the powerful bubblegum ripeness alongside papaya, banana and yellow melon.
90—92 Barrel sample. Very modern, polished in style, a wine whose new wood doesn't mask the rich fruit. The tannins are more to do with wood than fruit. This will be delicious.
As before, this is Pepper Bridge and Seven Hills Cabernet Sauvignon, with just a splash of Petit Verdot. For a Cab it's open and forward, showing juicy cherry and strawberry flavors, dotted with herb and spice, finished with luscious milk chocolate. The sharp tannins seem to tighten it up, suggesting further improvement with age. This is a classy effort, as always, but seems to want further bottle time to show its best.
Smoke wafts over pressed apple and lemon notes on the nose and palate of this off-dry Riesling. Sugary sweetness on the midpalate infused with hints of soapy florals and brambly vines detract from an otherwise pleasant, balanced wine.
From a vineyard that has 50% loess soil and 50% sandstone, this wine is open, generous and opulent. The fruits are in the green spectrum, but they are rich and finely perfumed.

Well-blended acids and tannins allow for it to be drunk now or over the next five to eight years. About 4,000 cases made. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.
Frosted aromas of orange creamsicle, lychee and melon give this an elevated, unique sort of bouquet. Among Chilean Gewürztraminers, this is one of the more expressive ones you'll find. Pineapple, mango and other tropical flavors are pleasant, while the feel is forward and fun. Drink this summer with fish and salads.
The only trouble with this bargain-priced version of a vendange tardive Pinot Gris will be finding some, as only 40 cases were imported. At only 11.6% alcohol, there's plenty of sugar left in the wine (67 g/l), concentrated and enriched by the inclusion of 50% botrytis-affected fruit. The impressions are of honeyed pineapple, ripe melon and peach preserves, finishing long and sweet. Delicious now, but should still be good 5–6 years down the road.
The Romorantin is a local grape found mainly in the Cheverny area of the central Loire. With a light gold color and touches that are oxidative, this is a fascinating wine. Quince, spice and some sweetness are balanced by acidity and fresh apple flavors, always with a sprinkling of pepper. Drink now.
On an eminence above the river Garonne, this estate is in the Entre-deux-Mers. The wine ,with its juicy red fruits, has just a touch of tannins along with crisp acidity and a mineral aftertaste. Produced from organically grown grapes, this is clean, bright and will be ready to drink from 2019.
This is Casal Branco's branded wine, designed to be drunk young. And that's exactly how it tastes, with bright, lively fruit, soft tannins, a very light vegetal hint, and a soft, almost jammy aftertaste. Highly enjoyable.
On the nose, apple and Concord grape aromas take on a stewed quality; add cream and graham cracker to the mix, and you've got a pretty sweet opening. Mouthfeel is soft and even, but perhaps hollow; palate and finish shows blackberry fruit, cocoa and toasted oak
There's a smooth, elegant quality to this Amarone that translates as black stone, exotic spice, cola and soft black fruit. The wine is also very plush and rich on the close with firm, but velvety tannins.
The wine's golden hue tells you this is Prosecco from a warmer climate (Conegliano is a few degrees warmer than Valdobbiadene) as do its aromas of mature peach and honeysuckle. The wine tastes flat and big in the mouth and offers sophisticated notes of white pepper and spice.
This reserve bottling, done entirely in stainless, brings extra weight and depth, with an enticing floral top note. Oranges and citrus-peel aromas carry into the palate, and a sense of powdered sugar suggests that perhaps it wasn't fermented completely dry. In any event, it's complex, compact and commanding.
Light aromas of spice, graphite and sour cherry are followed by elegant, tart fruit flavors. It's a pretty expression of the variety that should sing at the dinner table.
This Maule Malbec opens with pinched, herbal aromas of cherry and berry mixed with leather. The palate is fresh and zesty, almost to the point of being lean and scouring, with red plum, raspberry, cherry and a touch of vanilla. A quick finish that's tangy is the final act.
This dark wine has ripe black-cherry and plum fruit complemented by cinnamon, clove and heavy-toast oak. The suavely smooth palate displays more black fruit, licorice and olive accents. Espresso and semisweet chocolate flavors accompany the dusty tannins on the long finish. Cellar for two to four years.

This Bordeaux-style blend is oaky at first, with aromas of vanilla, caramel and mocha that slowly mellow and marry with the berry compote, fig and black plum core. The lush, mouthfilling palate has a texture like crushed velvet: rich, seductive and fruity, but with some tannic edge. Nuances of mocha and anise grace the long finish. Drink now–2018.
This blend of Catarratto, Grillo and Inzolia shows Sicilian personality, with bright lemon, almond and sea breeze aromas. The palate's freshness and lightness would pair well with grilled fish or shrimp.
A good, soft wine to drink now with a steak or chop. It's full-bodied and very rich in extracted blackberry jam and crème de cassis flavor, with touches of pepper, cocoa and bacon.
A lifting mix of golden, ripe apple, chamomile, moss and honey signals richness and some maturity. The palate is poised and holds all of these flavours tightly in a soaring, slender structure that is built on a firm foundation of bright acidity and subtle earthiness. Grown-up, taut, generous and poised, this is a honey-edged homage to the South Downs.
This is a gorgeous and very smooth wine that boasts all the irresistible traits of a well-made, modern Italian red. It showcases deep ruby concentration and everlasting aromas of ripe cherry, chocolate fudge, coffee, clove and spice. The mouthfeel is intense and penetrating and there's loads of chewy succulence on the finish.
Scents are beyond ripe, diving into raisins, prunes and balsamic. The wine smoothes out somewhat in the mouth, with figs and prunes and cooked cherries; but then turns dry and tannic. It seems to be on a fast-track aging curve.
Normally a wine with this score and price would earn front-line Best Buy status. But because it's brand new and total production is only 600 cases, you're going to have to work to find it. But if you do, expect a melon-driven wine with clean lines, good acidity and a long finish. It's refined Torrontés; aromatic and complex to the point that you might mistake it for a Rhône Valley Viognier or something similar.
From the winery's estate plantings above Seven Hills Vineyard in the new SeVein project, this wine is still closed aromatically, needing time or air to coax out its vanilla, toast, herb and dark cherry notes. The palate is dense, delivering layer upon layer of dark fruit flavors, with a compelling texture and impeccable balance. It has a long life ahead of it. Best 2022–2028.
A slick of wax and lanolin lends a mineral tone to bright apple cider and honey notes in this sprightly semisweet Riesling. Spine-tingling with acidity, it's an elegant, classically styled wine with a pristine, fruit-focused finish.
Savory pepper, tangy blueberry, black raspberry and pencil-shaving notes show on the nose of this blend of 78% Cabernet Sauvignon, 12% Cabernet Franc, 6% Petit Verdot and 4% Merlot. The cedar and graphite element carry to the palate, where tobacco, grapy fruits and dill make for an intriguing sip.
A good 100% Cabernet, with complex, pleasant cherry, blackberry and oak flavors. Quite tannic now, with a sandpapery mouthfeel, and very full-bodied. Feels a little ponderous, but could be going through an awkward phase. Try again after 2013.
This is not really a dry wine, but it is a very nice one because the acids and tannins make it balanced. The flavors are of mashed ripe cherries and raspberries, sprinkled with cinnamon and powdered cocoa.

It's been several years since I last tasted a Frazier Cab, but this '03 brought back memories of the excellent '99. It's not quite as rich, but is classically structured. From a cooler part of the valley, it blends dried herbs in with the black currants.
Mature dark berry, cake spice, baked earth, leather and a whiff of game are just some of the aromas you'll find on this impressive wine. The chewy palate offers ripe black cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon, white pepper and aromatic herb alongside a backbone of firm, ripe tannins and racy acidity. Drink 2019–2031.
This may be the first time this wine has been labeled Reserve; in the past it was just Finca Sophenia Malbec. And truth be told, it's a good but regular Malbec with berries and raisin on the bouquet, and then juicy berry fruit on the palate. Solidly made, with solid structure.
This blend of Albanello and Moscato opens with an off-gold color and rich aromas of yellow rose and honey. There's a touch of bitter almond on the palate.
The grapes come from the Chicken Dinner vineyard, which says it all. Pop this tart, tangy wine, with its Zin-like red berry flavors and hints of white pepper, and bring on the fried chicken. —P.G.
A premier cru that could almost be grand cru in quality terms, this is a big, ripe wine, the powerful yellow and green plum flavors spiced with some wood aging.

There is a very pretty herbal quality here that helps to enhance the wine's natural aromas of dark fruit, plum cake, black pepper, dried plum and prune. It boasts thick concentration and has gritty, nervous tannins on the close.
Quite rare in the U.S. market, this ripe richly berried wine is an excellent example of Frühburgunder, an early ripening mutation of Pinot Noir.

Dry and smooth, and a bit coarse, this wine shows berry, oak and leather flavors. Short finish.

The finish shines, marrying sugar and acid into a long, tongue-tingling finale.
From an organically grown, seven-acre vineyard that was planted nearly 40 years ago comes this savory, cooler-climate-styled Syrah.

The palate is very tarry and peppery, with flavors of dried elderberry and roasted lamb with a rosemary touch.

A good Syrah, dry and firm in tannins, although it lacks the richness and structure of Qupe's better bottlings. Shows easy flavors of blackberries, black cherries, cola, funky smoked meat and oak. Drink now.
The high elevation appellation of Chiroubles produces structured wine like this. It's a cool, tannin and crisp fruit flavored wine. Red currants are cut with acidity and a juicy, really fruity aftertaste. The structure will allow the wine to age a few months, so drink from the end of 2016.

Dramatically structured, with brilliant acidity, but needs time. Give it until at least 2012.

This is a generous fruity wine with ripe tannins and plenty of black currants. There is a good amount of Cabernet Franc (32%) in this perfumed wine, giving both the structure and the dusty tannins. This is ready to drink.
Neutral, slightly briny aromas are fresh but low on fruit. This has a slightly plump feel but not a lot of length or depth. Short basic white-fruit flavors match the nose, while this Xarello finishes dry in feel and mildly briny in flavor.
This Super Tuscan-like blend of 81% Sangiovese and 19% Cabernet Sauvignon, whose name refers to the little stones on the estate, shows reductive aromas of black olive, rubber and dried pressed purple flowers. Flavors range from mushroom to slate, but the tannins need mellowing and it could use a little more air altogether.
Very ripe and forward in baked fruit or pie-filling flavors of cherries and raspberries, spiced with cinnamon, anise and nutmeg. The wine is a bit simple and is ready to drink now.
A green, minty wave of challenging aromas comes with black olive, coconutty oak and graphite. The palate is bullish, scratchy in feel and tannic, with feral, herbal flavors of blackberry, juniper and wild herbs. Herbal and wild are the best words to describe this Syrah.
With a gentle, silky texture, this is a lovely Pinot Noir to drink now. Tart acidity gives the cherry and pomegranate flavors a sour candy savoriness. Elegant and charming, it's a nice partner for steak, lamb chops, grilled tuna.
Riesling's growing popularity has led to a number of recent brand introductions, like this one. It's light in body, with a wiry intensity to its acids and crisp green apple, lime and wet stone notes. Drink it over the next year.
Production is down, quality, cost and finished alcohol are all up for this estate-grown designate, now labeled as a reserve. There's a sniff of leather and underripe blackberry and black cherry fruit, along with a somewhat unusual, though not unpleasant, scent of chicken boullion. The wine opens up quickly but stops just a bit short of a full-length finish. Give it extra breathing time if you plan to drink it soon.
This Malbec is exceedingly ripe from start to finish. Aromas of blackberry, raisin, char and loamy earth announce a 16% heavyweight that holds onto its elegance. Flush, plump and elastic on the palate, this tastes of fig, blackberry, cassis and mocha. Chocolate and woodspice flavors drive a lush, dense finish that's a touch hot. Drink through 2020.
Packaged in the appellation's specially designed bottle, this Syrah from Steve Beckmen's mountaintop vineyard shows smashed blackberry, elderberry, graphite and roast beef aromas.

A generous example of young Ribera. Dark mint, cola and blackberry aromas get more herbal with airing. The palate is secure and tannic, with ripe blackberry and sweet Bing cherry flavors. Chocolaty and tannic on the finish.
This is a distinctive and unique Barolo with an edgy, brambly quality that comes forth aromatically as wild berry, forest floor, chopped herb, furniture wax for antiques and root beer. The wine leaves your palate with a dry, dusty impression thanks to the fine nature of its tannins.
The cherry and cinnamon aromas are true and inviting, and they stand up to the oak that's been thrown at this Pinot. The flavor profile deals raspberry and cherry amid oaky shadings. The finish is toasty and warm, with some coffee popping up late in the game. Fresh, fruity and true.
A lush, creamy Sauvignon Blanc from Foothills producer C.G. di Arie, which has traveled to Lodi here for its fruit. Full and rich, the wine has a pronounced taste of lime, especially on the finish. It is dry and crisp, ready for goat cheese and seafood.
A nose of strawberry and mint with a whiff of petrol sets the scene for flavors of cassis, cherry preserves, peach and eucalyptus that never quite coalesce. Soft tannins drop off immediately after a burst of white peach at the finish.
From a hilltop spot in an appellation increasingly adept at growing the variety in a restrained way, this wine is voluptuous on the palate while also offering complex layers of smoky meat, truffle earth and black licorice. The finish completes the experience with a healthy dose of black pepper.
Woody berry aromas are solid but standard. This blend of Marselán, Tannat and Merlot is hard as nails, with rubbery tannins. Saucy plum flavors are green and spicy, while this shows abrasive residual tannins on a firm but limited finish.
Sestina is the bigger sister to the winery's Gravura; again Cabernet Sauvignon takes front and center, with Merlot (18%) and Cabernet Franc (9%) filling in the rest. 70% of the French oak used was new, and the wine has more toast, smoke and barrel depth than its companion, though less of the luscious red fruit is showing. Espresso, cacao and other dark, roasted flavors wrap around black cherry cola and milk chocolate; the finish thoroughly delicious.
With a dominance of Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend, this structured and firm wine has a dry, dusty character lightened by black currant fruitiness. The aftertaste, with its good mix of fruit and acidity shows a wine that's likely to be ready to drink from 2016.
Stewed prune marinated in spirits, coconut, espresso and grilled herb aromas unfold in the glass. The firm palate offers dark cherry, coffee, anise and tobacco alongside bracing tannins bright acidity. Best after 2019.
Fairly mature and less rough than most Tannat-based wines. This one features cola, rubber and cedar aromas followed by tangy red-berry fruit. Somewhat oily and rubbery on the palate but it tastes alright. Includes 40% Cab Franc.
Smashed black plums, mulberry and alpine strawberry show through the crushed rocks on the nose of this bottling that is lifted by a tarragon spice. Tangy blackberry and elderberry show on the palate, where wild thyme, oregano and peppercorns contribute to an intriguing sense of depth.
While the wine has a steely edge to it, it also has delicious, warm, full yellow fruits, juicy acidity and wood that fits well within the overall structure. For aging over 3–4 years.
This is a big, fruity wine that has a dense texture and intense white fruit and peach fruit flavors. It's an impressive, rich wine, worth aging for 2–3 years. Screwcap.
Smells like ultraripe nectarines or peaches, flesh practically oozing from the skins. In the mouth, it's big, rich and enveloping, yet it finishes with a trace of bitter peach pit. Imported by W.J. Deutsch & Sons.
Layers of smoked nut and dark toast aromas lend savoriness to slightly muted black cherry and plum notes in this dry Lemberger, a.k.a. Blaufränkisch. It's a light-bodied, briskly composed red with delicate concentration. Fine grained tannins lend soft structure to the finish. Drink now.
Dusty, rubbery berry aromas are peppery and scratchy. This has a round, bouncy mouthfeel and loamy, lightly baked flavors of blackberry and raisin. An earthy, loamy-tasting finish provides a weighty anchor.
This suave-textured and lavishly fruity wine combines a rich baking-spice aroma, with saturated blackberry, blueberry and dark chocolate flavors. The mouthfeel of this Bordeaux-style blend is smooth and creamy and the finish is long.
A rich, complex Pinot that shows the intricacies of Santa Lucia Pinot Noir yet retains an immediate drinkability for its silky fruit forwardness. Dry and crisp, the flavors of cherries, currants, cola, vanilla and smoky oak finish with a clean spiciness.

This Cabernet-Shiraz blend offers up mocha, espresso and humus on the nose while the palate has some nice coconut flavor that is hemmed in a bit by a note of model glue. The spicy finish ends with a soft kiss of tannin. Best to drink now, after giving it some air.
Here's a simple but enjoyable Cab with notes of black plum, violet and cassis. Medium weight with soft tannins and a solid finish.
While the wine is rich and tarry, it has an old-fashioned feel to it that comes from the juicy tannins and touch of rusticity. That's not unattractive, a wood-aged oxidized wine that has fruit and spice to add to its allure. Drink from 2015.
The best Sassicaia of the last 10 years, the 2004 vintage is an outstanding achievement. Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc highlight the beauty of Tuscany and portray the region in terms of thick chocolate fudge, succulent cherry and currant, exotic spice and vanilla seed. Beyond those big aromas are little teasers: blue flowers, Mediterranean herbs, cola and light mineral shadings. It's lush and full in the mouth and will hold 20 or 30 years.
Essentially a Washington Chardonnay (with just 6% of the fruit sourced in Oregon), this is sharp-toned and slightly volatile in the nose. It falls a little flat in the mouth, tasting like a soft banana, and fades quickly.
Here's a rich and oaky Ribera del Duero that pours on the bacon, hickory and earth aromas in addition to black fruit and licorice notes. It feels huge and tannic but still well balanced, with bacon, clove and baked black-fruit flavors. It holds onto its barbecued character, ending with a fiery finish. Drink now–2016.
This cuvée is principally from the estate (Appassionata) vineyard. Lush, spicy and spread broadly across the palate, it pleases with strawberry-raspberry fruit, milk chocolate and a dusting of cocoa powder. The wine does seem to lighten up rather quickly at the finish, but further bottle age may fix that.
There are soft grapefruit-peach aromas and flavors, tart lime notes and a medium body here. It's not complex, but it's not supposed to be. It has no bad marks at all, and even a little length to show. A good bar pour or gallery opener.
Leeuwin Estate hits the spot with its 2006 Siblings Shiraz, tailored for immediate consumption. It delivers bold aromas and flavors of cracked peppercorns and black cherries in a medium-bodied format framed by supple tannins that turn slightly dusty on the finish. Drink it over the next few years.
Still youthful and vibrant, the 2007 Taylors Pass Pinot Noir features full-on black cherry fruit, tinged with hints of herbs and licorice. It's a beefy, chunky Pinot that should age reasonably well; drink now–2018.
Red rose, wild berry, toast, tobacco and a whiff of underbrush meld in the glass. On the firm palate, notes of clove, ground pepper, cinnamon, anise and mocha accent the red berry core. Firm, fine-grained tannins offer structure.
This Zin is so soft, so ripe, so dessert-like, it could come from Paso Robles, Lodi or any other hot climate. Shows honeyed flavors of black cherry preserves, root beer and milk chocolate, with deficient acidity and tannins. Needs greater structure, which the '05 vintage may bring.
Aromas of wild berry, underbrush and a balsamic note come together on this. On the full-bodied palate, notes of espresso, mocha and vanilla add depth to the black cherry core. Firm tannins provide the framework.
Exotic strips of lemon zest mark this wine, followed by intense acidity that begs for food to tame it down. The vineyards involved are on the cooler side. Expect spice and tangy grapefruit to glide on the finish.

Merlot (44%) takes the lead on this wine followed by Cabernet Franc (29%) and Cabernet Sauvignon (18%), with the balance of blend of Petit Verdot and Malbec.

Concentrated aromas of blackberry, cherry and mashed fig abound, while flavors of black plum skins dominate the palate and coat the mouth with a firm texture. Medium tannins linger on the finish alongside a hint of roasted cocoa nib.
Peppery leather opens up this wine, blended with 5% Mourvèdre. More savory than fruity, it pleases in big tannin weight and length, with an intensity of brambly wildness and a sagey, smoky edge.
Blackberry, oregano, asphalt and black gravel show on the nose of this first vintage effort from a new property along Highway 154 in Los Olivos. Dill, fennel, oregano and marjoram contribute to an herbaceous palate, which give nuance to the pressed olallieberry and grape fruits.
Mixed white-fruit aromas are generic. In the mouth, this is full in body and grabby in texture. Flavors of jumbled citrus, salt and orange peel finish pithy and briny but with good feel. Overall, this feels better than it tastes or smells.
Slightly saucy on the nose, with jammy, baked fruit aromas hinting at cherry and raspberry. The palate feel is a little tough but healthy, with red fruit flavors accented by vanilla and coconut. Tight, crisp and showing a final wave of tomato on the finish.
This fruit-driven wine lacks a touch of minerality but features admirably pure, focused notes of perfectly ripe apples, pineapple and citrus. It's a sweet, medium-bodied spätlese that's plump and succulent, delicious sipped on its own on a warm summer evening. Imported by Chapin Cellars, LLC.

Dry lime and citrus peel aromas are round and solid, nothing more. That more or less describes the palate, which tastes a little bit wheaty and dull, with a note of bitter melon on the finish. Drink now.
Mature black fruit, leather, wild berries and balsamic notes waft out of the glass. The solid palate delivers red cherry, toast and a whiff of orange peel alongside bracing tannins.
This perfectly captures this spectacular vineyard's flavor “stamp”—a beguiling mix of aromas, flavors and textures that begin with orange peel and moist earth and unfold across the palate in a graceful jumble. Streaks of compost, raw meat, tart berry and good funk run together seamlessly, creating a supple, continuously enjoyable wine that just doesn't want to quit. Notably, the alcohol is listed at just 13.8%—and it feels natural and fully ripe at that level.
Very hard in tannins, and bone dry, this is a tough, aloof wine. Decanting may coax out some blackberries. Equal parts Cab Sauvignon, Cab Franc and Merlot.
Fresh, primary red-cherry and raspberry flavors get a kick of cherry-cola spice and vanilla here. It's an approachably plummy, juicy red with soft, feathery tannins, but puckering cranberry acidity keeps it fresh. Drink now through 2020.
88-90. Barrel sample. A rounded, soft and rich wine, it shows sweet tannins and a ripe blackberry fruit character. This expression is juicy, ripe and fruity.
A scent of toasted oak fully wraps the nose, with touches of mint, fruitcake and blackberry underneath. Fine-grained, astringent tannins coat the tongue, and tangy acids gain steam toward the finish.

With 15 months in French oak, this blend of 80% Syrah and 20% Grenache starts off rich and lavish, as creamy mocha notes infuse the deep plum, blueberry and black cherry fruit core.

There is a touch of spice and pepper that gives the wine an attractive edge. It is all about delicious red-currant and orange-zest fruit. Drink now.
Hints of honeysuckle are very restrained on the nose. The palate is dry and shaped by rounded lemony freshness and hints of zesty spice. This is wonderfully light and deeply aromatic, but not obviously so. A wonderfully subtle expression of Muscat.
Very sweet, with honey and apricot jam flavors balanced with keen acidity. Yet sweetness is almost all you get. The underlying flavors are thin.
Here is a fresh expression of Pinot Bianco from the Lombardy region of northern Italy that exhibits sweet aromas of peach and apricot followed by almond honey and white flower. In the mouth, this crisp white wine shows a touch of sourness.

A delicious nose of baked fruit, spice and melon leads on this appealing Chenin from Spice Route. An elegant, traditional balance of rich fruit and crisp acid gives the wine a food-pairing advantage. Think poultry, lobster.
The bouquet here is confounding. It has some green vegetable and cat-pee qualities as well as white stone fruits, sulfur and popcorn. In a word, it's complicated. In the mouth, grapefrut and celery flavors mingle with green grapes, while on the back end it's chalky and rather tart. The overall acidity is high, and there's one important thing missing here: balance.
Here is a supple, firm, well-balanced Cabernet, with both Merlot and Syrah in supporting roles. Berry and plum flavors, crisp tannins, and a whiff of red pepper all come into play.
Smooth and spicy, matching bright, tight, sweet-tart lemony fruit to nicely integrated barrel notes of sandalwood and graham cracker. The sleek structure, balanced for cellaring as well as immediate enjoyment.

This wine charms with aromas of freshly sliced green apple, white peach, wet stone and flowers. It drinks off dry, with zippy acidity providing plenty of tension to keep the interest high.
Relentless is Shafer's Syrah-based red wine. It's always rich, ripe and bold, and the 2009 is no exception. The alcohol is very high, making the wine heady and warm. If you can get past that, you'll find a huge wine, massive in blackberry, plump raisin and chocolate flavors, with soft tannins and a long, sweet finish. The blend contains 18% Petite Sirah.
Firmly tannic still, this wine is fully ripe, rich and structured. Considerably powerful, it's full of red fruits and dark plums cut with a fine line of acidity. Finishes fresh, with sweet tannins that linger. Drink this fine wine from 2017.
Punchy citrus, apple and lanolin aromas are a bit dusty and entirely typical of Rías Baixas Albariño. Direct citrus flavors and a note of briny orange peel finish a bit salty, with a hint of green banana.
There's not a region or grape type that Telmo Rodríguez won't tackle, and here he's on to Moscatel in the deep south. This wine exhibits lilac aromas with hints of smoked ham and hard cheese. It's not a perfect bouquet, but it is intriguing. In addition, look for a bulky but rewarding palate featuring chewy sweet fruit and moderate acidity.
Peppery spice, tart goosebery and white grapefruit notes shine in this varietally characteristic Grüner Veltliner. It's delicate in concentration but cutting and fresh, finishing on a refreshing mineral tone. Drink now through 2018.

Intense and luscious with lots of barrel over bright raspberry fruit. The fruit intensity is extraordinary. It's delicious, sharp and lingering, with intense and pure fruit flavor stuck to a wall of toasty oak.
This wine consistently scores in the upper 80s. This vintage is dealing hard spice and herbal aromas along with tight-grained oak scents. Fresh but tannic, with bite and juicy, racy flavors of berry matched by woodspice. Fades away with hickory and BBQ flavors.
Superripe, almost sweet, this has good acidity and firm, fuzzy tannins that help balance the jammy cherry, raspberry and cola flavors. Good with a slightly sweet barbecue sauce on ribs and chicken.
Groseilles is French for red currant, and there is a definite red-fruit character here, with a hint of smokiness and sweet tannins over layers of wood. The wine is still young and relatively soft, but offers aging over the next three to four years.
This blend of Savatiano and Roditis is very popular in Greece and perhaps a bit too exotic for mainstream palates, but it's easy drinking and priced well. Aromas of citrus and melon are followed by peach and honeydew melon flavors. Simple but friendly.
Is that breakfast in the nose?  The scrambled eggs and toast aromas leave you asking for the bacon and coffee.  this bubbly is bulky and full-bodied, with a sugary center of ripe red apple and pear.  Good in a simple way, but not exciting.
Simple and bright with clean lines, this easy-drinking Soave Classico offers citrus, white peach and talc powder aromas. Pair it with fried finger foods or spicy Thai spring rolls.
The nose here is flat as a board, offering next to nothing. Simple green apple and underripe pear flavors fail to rescue the wine, while a finish lacking definition and length seals its fate. For a producer that largely succeeds with Shiraz, the cute name of this wine is unfortunately the best thing that it has to offer.
Spanish broom, dried lychee, aromatic Mediterranean herb and balsamic notes are just some of the aromas of this multifaceted wine. The linear palate shows compelling depth, delivering layers of mature yellow apple, Bartlett pear, thyme, salvia and energizing mineral alongside still-bright acidity. This wine could go on for another several years at least. Drink through 2021.
Full and rounded wine, with touches of toast, pineapple, melon and peach. It's a fine expression of Alvarinho, keeping the essential fresh structure of the grape while also giving extra weight and richness.
Bright yellow with fresh lime aromas and flavors of yellow fruit and pear. A bubbly, broad wine that lacks the substance of some of Gruets other bottlings.
Light, bright and luminous, this fresh and floral Roero Arneis is aged in stainless steel to maintain its natural zest and fruitiness. Pair the wine with shellfish or white meat.
This is a soft wine that is full in the mouth, with a raspberry purée flavor and soft acidity. It's round with a depth of red fruit flavor and a warm finish.
Way too soft and ripe, and although it's technically dry, this tastes like a concoction of chocolate mousse, crème de cassis and cinnamon. Luscious, but it isn't really a dry table wine.
Very dark, and rather heavy in texture, this is an earthy wine. The flavors suggest coffee and black cherries.
Any SB boasting 14.5% alcohol is going to come across as being real big, and this one does for sure. But beyond its heft, it offers underripe melon, pear and butter flavors and an odd cheesy quality. There's also a forest's worth of oak here, which makes it heavy rather than balanced.
There's considerable earthiness to the nose of this Malbec, grown in Zin-heavy Rockpile. Soft and wrapped in cinnamon spice, its sizable tannins are offset by just enough acidity to keep the wine mouthwatering and mellowed.
Made in a full-bodied and fleshy style, this comes from an estate vineyard long owned by the producer. Cloudy, with a distinct fresh cherry aroma, it opens with leathery tannins and pronounced oak notes before its bright, citrus-like acidity settles in.
Flowery and lively, with apple and mild citrus flavors. More than decent on the tongue, with good balance. More steady and solid than spectacular, with varietal correctness and ample weight.
Heavily dominated by wood at this stage, a wine that will always be firm, laying tannins over the red berry fruit stalkiness. The wine needs two years.
This boasts a dark amber color, with thick extraction and superintense aromas of candied fruit, honey, brown sugar and maple syrup. The mouthfeel is divinely rich and supple.
Aptly named as this Syrah is grown at 3,000-feet elevation, the wine is full of very ripe plum, dark cherry and gamy meat flavors, with thick tannins evocative of leather and cigar box. A big-time Syrah that will deliver nuance and complexity as it opens up, particularly when paired with appropriately rich foods.
Dense and rich, with a resemblance to chocolate fudge. A blend of 60% Grenache, 30% Shiraz and 10% Mataro, this is a touch raisiny but clearly very concentrated and intense. Drink now.
This bottle was disgorged in July 1995, allowing nine years of aging. It is a very ripe, soft wine, delicate but still underlain with some of the steely, mineral character of the 1996 vintage. Delicious now, but it will certainly age over the next five years.
Dry Jurançon has all the richness and hints of honey of its sweet partner. The two Manseng grapes give apricot, white peach and a full, ripe character that is cut by the typical acidity of these mountain vineyards. The wine, with its zesty aftertaste and delicious tension between fresh and rich, is ready to drink.
From old vines planted in 1975, this is one of the last of the Lemberger plantings from the early days of Washington viticulture. Nice blackberry fruit is washed in tannins and lightly oaked; a simple, satisfying pizza wine.
This 100% Petite Sirah showcases the variety's tannins, full body and fruity concentration, with waves of blackberry and blueberry jam, cherry pie, cbocolate and new oak flavors. It's too soft to develop in the bottle, but will be lovely over the next year with rich stews and roasts.
Simple, sharp and spicy, this is a generic, all-purpose red wine with some cherry fruit and chewy tannins.
Red berry, leather and aromatic herb aromas slowly appear in the glass along with a subtle whiff of violet. The taut palate is still tightly wound, offering red cherry, cranberry and star anise alongside youthfully assertive fine-grained tannins that leave a firm finish.

This begins as a hard, tight wine with hints of rose petal around a core of blackberry hard candy. The balance is superb, and the wine is lively with nuanced, dark notes blending smoke, espresso and bitter chocolate. An intriguing animal scent surfaces after some hours of breathing.
This 2012 offering—100% Chardonnay that's 40% aged in American, French, and Hungarian oak—has notes of tangerine, pear, and petroleum jelly. The stone fruit flavors are sweet and rich, occasionally leaning toward the tropical.
The aromas bring notes of plum, blue fruit and barrel spice. The palate comes off as considerably darker, with rich fruit flavors supported by firm tannins. There are lots of good things going on if the aromas and flavors sync up, though it doesn't seem much like Cabernet.
Open-knit and approachable, this is a warm, velvety wine. Cedar, chocolate and cherry notes glide easily across the palate. Drink now–2020.
Crisp snap-pea and cucumber aromas are lightly citric. This feels fresh, tangy and citric, with plenty of acidic cut. Lime, pea and bell pepper flavors are about as true to Chilean SB as it gets.
With smidgens of Viognier and Sémillon, this wine offers aromas of sweet jasmine and fig, and is bright with some heft on the palate. With suggestions of tropical fruit and apricot, the acidity is subtle.
Shows wonderful purity of fruit—green apple and lime, perhaps a touch of flower shop greens—and impreccable balance, being light in body, off dry, crisp and refreshing. Delicious.
Warm and soft, with hints of prune and cooked blackberries alongside touches of chocolate and tobacco, this blend of 62% Cabernet Sauvignon, 34% Merlot and 4% Petit Verdot is a plush, easy-drinking red. Like the Reserve Cabernet, it seems perfectly suited for near-term consumption with grilled steak.
This off-dry rendition of Pinot Gris (the “it” grape in NZ right now) boasts a lovely, rich mouthfeel. Aromas of pear, almond and apple, then more of the same on the palate, picking up some pineapple notes on the finish. Not complex enough to rate higher, but a very pleasing wine. Imported by Via Pacifica Imports.
Lush, jammy black fruit fills the palate on this dense, boldly structured blend of Bulgarian Rubin and Merlot grapes. It's undeniably juicy and forward, but balanced by a streak of sharp acidity and soft, chalky tannins that linger.
This is another of Hidalgo's superb 30-year-old Sherries, and this example shows hazelnut, butterscotch and citrus aromas on a lifted, luxe nose. The mouthfeel is just right, with oily weight cut by sharp acidity. Flavors of apricot, orange peel, toffee and almond skins finish long and unwavering.
There's an impressive freshness to this seven-year-old bottling, with both just-picked and baked blackberry aromas alongside pressed violets and dried ginger on the lavish nose. Vibrant olallieberries show on the sip, with violet-flavored cake adding to this study of purple flavors.
Attractive red-plum and berry fruit aromas and flavors lay the framework, while supporting accents of garrigue, pepper and leathery spice add depth and character. A lush fruitiness floods the palate, but is countered with a mineral tang and a touch of smoke on the lingering finish.
Falls into the dark and roasted category, with aromas of leather, black fruits and toast. The palate is saturated and full, with dark, roasted black fruit, molasses and spice flavors. Warm on the finish almost to the point of being hot, but not quite. A very solid wine overall.
This blend of Rolle, Ugni Blanc and Clairette is bright and tangy. It offers a definite herbal flavor as well as ripe yellow fruits integrated into a texture that is crisp and mineral. The wine is ready to drink.
Dry and crisp in acidity, with savory citrus and flower flavors braced with minerals. There are some green notes that detract, however.
Tan in color and fairly sharp stuff, with a prickly feel and piercing flavors of melon and peaches. At 14% alcohol it seems over the edge.
Juicy sweet on the nose and palate, this semidry Gewürztraminer is likeable for its unabashed fruit forwardness. Sweet peach and melon candy flavors finish a bit on the confected side with a swirl of perfumy florals.
This is a very rich, creamy wine. Fermented in stainless steel, the creaminess must come from lees aging. The flavors of orange and apricot jam and zesty lemon tart are dominant, but vital acidity also stars, giving the finish a spicy punch.
This standout wine has an extreme color that verges on black, while exciting aromas suggest wood smoke and grilled beef, with flavors so rich they could be chocolate. The wine puts those all together without becoming heavy or too stiff in texture, although it does have a flood of fine tannins that help layer in more fruit and spices as you sip. Best after 2019.
Haute-Serre is high on the plateau above the Lot river. It produces wines that are structured with complex tannins and an austere fruit character. This 2011 is in that mold. It has acidity as well as juicy black fruits, plus striated tannins that are in the process of being smoothed by the wood aging. Drink from 2018.
Easy and sweet wine, with tannins and strawberry jam flavors. The wine has a toffee and caramel character that is full and ripe.
One taste and you can see the correlation between this Priorat dry PX and certain fino-style Sherries. It's nutty and dry as a bone, with almondy aromas. Crisp acidity provides backbone and the flavors of barely sweet pear, apple and white peach are fully dry and don't push the envelope. Clean but limited in scope.
Ripe, almost overripe, with a taste of raisins in the finish, but that's just one aspect of this pretty little Zin's personality. It's dry and tannic and spicy, and very flavorful in berries and cedar. Nice with grilled fare, a great summertime BBQ wine.
This is solid example of the variety, with its apple and pear flavors. The wine feels a bit flat in the mouth, lacking snap and freshness.
The wine is fine, fresh and crisp. It has balanced acidity and lively pink grapefruit fruit flavors that give the wine a good, clean, clear character. There is a juicy bright, refreshing aftertaste. Drink now.
Nicely built on a solid red fruit core, the berry, cherry and licorice aromas and flavors here wear a heavy wood cloak that holds the fruit in check a bit too much. It's hard not to feel that the full potential of the fruit has been stymied here. Still, the mouthfeel is good and it finishes with attractive, spicy dry cherry, anise and wood notes. Will appeal more to lovers of lavish oak.
Passion fruit and nectarine aromas are joined by hints of jalapeno, while the palate displays stone fruit flavors with tropical overtones and grassy accents. This medium-bodied wine is textbook Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc at a refreshingly affordable price.
Waxy white fruit aromas of peach and apple are a touch baked, with vanilla peeking through. The palate is smooth and offers good mouthfeel, while the flavors of lemon, apple and hay are good and finish buttery and creamy. Made by Finca Allende; 70% Viura and 30% Malvasia.
The name is not a Portuguese greeting, but a blending of Alvarinho and Loureiro, the grapes in the wine. It is a rich, juicy wine full of apricot, apple and pear flavors. It has just the right amount of tangy texture and refreshing acidity. The wine is fruity, perfumed and bright.
A deliciously vibrant wine, with oak-inspired citrus peel, peach, fig and creamy honey-vanilla flavors. However, as succulent as it is, from such a great winery, it could be far better.
Both ripe mirabelle and yellow juicy pear appear on the nose. The palate brims with the same fruit. The body is precise and fresh with a lip-smacking citrus finish.
Kind of hard, pasty and candied on the nose, with a thick and chunky palate feel along with sweet, sugary, generic red fruit flavors. Hailing from Patagonia, this is a basic, creamy Cabernet with body and size but not too much character.

A piercingly citrus wine, the fruit as fresh as can be, rounded by the wood aging. There is a really bright character here that is appetizing and fresh.
Entirely varietal from one appellation and aged in 100% new French oak tanks for more than two years, this is a substantially robust and tannic wine, puckering somewhat on the palate. Red berry, coconut and a strong herbal component combine for a leathery grip and need for cellaring. Enjoy best from 2022 through 2030.
While the wine is rich, it's also very crisp and fruity. Tight acidity and a chalky, steely texture are balanced by ripe apples and pink grapefruit. It's a wine for drinking this year, bright and fruity.

Named after the French soldier who served under George Washington, this is an attractive, upright wine. Acidity and fresh cherries come through strongly along with a dry layers of tannins. It's likely to age at least a few more months, so drink from 2016.
Plenty of flavor, with tastes of black raspberry jam, cherry, tobacco and pepper. Has a nice texture, satiny and velvety, with good acidity. Straddles the border between simple and complex, but it's certainly tasty with a good, long finish.
A throwback style, with creamy vanilla, dill, tomato and raspberry aromas. The palate is just round and lush enough to not be edgy, but there's ample acid to drive the plum, cherry, cola and raisin flavors toward a clean, linear finish. No miracles here; just good, well-made, fairly traditional Rioja.
A dry, well structured Bordeaux blend. Speaks volumes for the winery's efforts to wrest real complexity and style from these rugged, hot Foothills. Shows proper blackberry, black currant and herb flavors, with a balanced touch of oak. Ready now.
Rustic and funky, with a curious nose sending up scents of fruit, musk, soy, pepper and espresso. Flavors are vivid and grapey, and there is a penetrating spicy note running throughout. The finish is tannic and rough.
An overtly raisiny, almost cooked bouquet, leads this full-bodied, ultraripe CS. It is appealing for its richness, density and weight. Flavors of cassis and blackberry are on the fringe of being syrupy, while moss, prune, black pepper and herbal flavors pop up on a plush finish.
This structured, bright 100% Zinfandel features heaps of high-toned red berry and baking cinnamon. Medium in weight, it's a food-friendly wine that offers the variety's classic juiciness without its sometimes overbearing hits of smoky oak.
This is a nice little Viura (with 15% Chardonnay) that smells nutty and smooth and tastes of tangy citrus and other white stone fruits. It has more acidity than body and it locks onto that citrusy profile and doesn't let go. But overall it's a good quaff for the price.
There is a voluptuous edge to this generous wine. It has rich flavors, some strawberry and plum juice. The final extreme freshness shows through the layer of firm tannins. For aging over 4–5 years.
The tech sheet for this wine nicely mentions how the vineyard is surrounded by both 100-year-old walnut trees and, what do you know?, marijuana. Does either influence the wine? It does show a muskiness but really its strengths are steely drops of extreme lemon, most decidedly on the long, exuberant finish.
A sensational Cab that exhibits power and opulence in the ripe blackcurrant, cherry, cocoa and new oak flavors, yet is subtlely balanced and harmonious. Showcases preternaturally gorgeous tannins, soft and sweet. The more you sip, the greater the impression.
With some wood aging, this is a richer Pinot Noir than some from Alsace. Good color, red berry fruits and an intense juicy line of acidity. Not for aging, but with some weight.
Now one of three Viogniers produced by Charles Smith, this is from Art den Hoed's Yakima Valley Vineyard, and was barrel fermented in neutral French oak. Clean and pure fruit aromas lead into fresh, natural, tree fruit flavors of peach and apricot. There's a nice kick of citrus in the vibrant acidity.
Are golfer-inspired wines the next big thing? First came Greg Norman, then Ernie Els, now there's Nick Faldo. Made by Katnook Estate, this is a dark, plushly textured wine that's immediately accessible. Cassis and plum fruit is framed by dark accents of coffee and cola, picking up hints of mint on the finish. Imported by Freixenet USA.
Tight, confident and built upon well-ripened, berry-flavored fruit, this complex, impeccable Cab mixes in notes of iodine, smoke and iron. It suggests what the British call “breed”—a mixture of power and elegance.
This opens with rustic aromas suggesting leafy underbrush, game and a hint and of barnyard. The funky aromas follow through to the approachable, rather muddled palate, along with leather, truffle, dried black cherry and a confectionary note. Drink now.
Spécial Club is a grouping of growers who taste each other's wines and approve them for Club status. This is certainly an impressive wine, seamlessly moving from freshness to richness via a steely texture. It is still impressively young and fruity, a bright, crisp wine that will age for several more years. Drink from 2016.
Structured white fruits, this is a complex and concentrated wine. Toast, apple and apricot flavors are blended with herbs and intense acidity. Spice from the wood shows on the finish.

Expect zesty, rounded and spritzy freshness from this fruit-driven little tonic; it's a pear and citrus party in the glass.
A nicely balanced barrel-aged Chard, this wine offers scents of toasted hazelnuts, vanilla and citrus, then builds on those flavors by adding broader peach notes. It's fairly full-bodied, but avoids being heavy, and boasts a long, elegant finish.
The Nieuwould family has farmed at Cederberg for five generations—hence the name. This top Cabernet from the estate vineyards comes from old vines, giving huge concentration and elegance. Aged for 18 months in wood, this intense, berry- dominated wine also shows big, dry fruit tannins, and should age for a good 10 years.
Invigorating white grapefruit and lemons are cast against a deep mineral backdrop in this dry, thirst quenching wine. It's delicate and filigreed on the palate with a brisk, tight finish. Drink now.
An old-vines white wine from the Douro is rare, and this rich wine rewards the winemaker who found the grapes. Aged in wood, ripe and with lemon, peach and grapefruit flavors, it balances richness with a crisp, taut texture. Age this wine a year.
Brisk acidity gives this ripe, honeyed wine a much-needed hit of crispness. The flavors are very rich, of tangerines, papayas and the sweet taste of Meyer lemons. Delightful and satisfying for a cocktail sipper, or with Thai, Vietnamese or Chinese pork and chicken dishes.
This is a pleasant wine, with grapefruit and nectarine fruit, fresh but just a little flat through the midpalate. A good sipping wine, it's best served chilled and enjoyed while young.
This is a nice Chardonnay to drink with shellfish, particularly grilled shrimp. It's dry and crisp in acidity, with rich pineapple, green apple and pear flavors, accented with sweet, toasty oak.
The flatter Friuli Aquileia area has produced a wine with notes of green grass and some vegetal tones with peach and melon. But the ensemble seems slightly disjointed, and the wine is light and simple in the mouth.
Aromas of mature Golden Delicious apple, honey, walnut and bread crust lead the nose. The concentrated palate offers extremely ripe yellow apple, citrus zest, toast and bitter walnut alongside a vibrant, persistent perlage.
This sweet Recioto opens with thick, inky blackness and jammy aromas of black fruit, plum and prune. You can taste some oak-driven flavors of spice and smoke. The wine ends with a blast of astringent, ripe tannins.
A tiny percentage of Chardonnay is added to this Prosecco Superiore, giving it a small boost in terms of structure and creaminess. That addition adds a scent of fresh fruit, with subtle hints of apricot and exotic spice.
Graham cracker, raisin, earth and leather aromas announce a level of richness. It feels prune-like and saturated but not flat, with blackberry and exotic spice flavors. It qualifies as a lush, ripe specimen with a long finish that stays the course. Syrah, Cabernet and Tempranillo are the components.
A delicate, lacy style of Pinot Noir, with pretty rhubarb-like herbal shadings to the cranberry and strawberry fruit, extremely supple tannins and hints of cocoa and coffee on the abbreviated finish. Drink now.
Sour plum, dried herb, pepper and tar scents show on the nose of this bottling from the widely available brand. The palate is tightly wound with sticky tannins, which are like to mellow with time, allowing the coffee, asphalt, elderberry and black currant flavors to shine more brightly.
This is Longboard's most successful of three 2010 Syrahs. It comes from the winery's estate Westside Road vineyard, whose vines now are acquiring some age. It's a complex wine, dry, full-bodied and tannic, with blackberry, currant, tobacco, grilled prosciutto, mineral and pepper flavors that finish long and satisfying. Drink now–2016.
This is a wine that doesn't mess with niceties, but is right in your face. Intensely perfumed, almost a caricature of Gewürz, this is rich, moving into sweetness, concentrated and very spicy.
Restrained ripeness does not make this an obvious wine, but it comes towards you if you spend time with it. Notions of yellow pear and Golden Delicious apple partner with an herbal twist and refreshing citrus acidity.
The wine is soft with a flinty edge that gives it structure. There is a juicy character to this clean crisp wine that reveals itself in the apple, lime and grapefruit flavors. The wine is young, although very ready to drink.
After opening with reedy, stalky aromas, this is raw and choppy on the palate. Flavors of herbal red plum and rhubarb conclude with tight, edgy acids and a bit of burn and heat. This is fresh and generally pretty good, but it lacks Toro's usual richness and power.
The winery doesn't tell us where in this gigantic, multi-county region the grapes came from, but it's quite a good wine. Firm in citrusy acids, with a mineral undertow, it's a dry, elegant wine with complex notes of pineapples, buttered toast and creamy lees. Lots of oak, but it's integrated with the fruit.
Shows true cool-climate varietal character in the aromas and flavors of cherries, cola, pomegranates and rhubarb pie, with complicating notes from charred oak barrels. Very good, mouthfilling and dry, with brisk acidity. Should develop in the bottle for a few years.
This solid red opens with aromas of dark-skinned berry, toast and underbrush. The firm palate offers wild cherry, ground pepper, coffee and a hint of mineral alongside polished, fine-grained tannins.
This displays ripe black-skinned fruit, Mediterranean herb and baking spice aromas. The dense palate delivers blackberry, clove and tobacco flavors, with close-grained tannins that leave a grippy finish.
This is densely rich, its power emphasized by the pepper edge to the pear flavors, the spice and structure a powerhouse of flavors. In the range of single-vineyard wines from Rupert Summerer, this is probably the sipping, rather than drinking, wine. Glass stopper.
This earthy, mature Cab is rusty in color, with aromas of dried red fruits, tobacco and leaves leading to a medium-bodied, smooth palate. Flavors of cola, cocoa, red licorice and cherry finish with mellow tannins and a final dusting of cocoa powder. Drink now.
Multi-dimensional and inviting, the nose offers a melange of cherry, spice, earth and gamy notes. A very supple mouthfeel follows with wonderfully firm, but not biting, acidity. Dark cherry and oak flavors hang on a handsome frame. Closes with a long, spicy finish with beautifully integrated tannins. Has great character; a most impressive example of the vintage and the Knight’s Gambit and Red Hills Estate Vineyards.
Ripe aromas of brandied cherry, cassis, dried cheese, tobacco and mocha are alluring. This has a linear palate with acidity in the driver's seat. Flavors of vanilla, plum, currant and wood-grain finish with additional oak and red-fruit residue. Drink through 2022.
This is a textbook Deep Purple special: huge berry, menthol and violet aromas create a hefty, lusty bouquet. In the mouth, it is more narrow than you might hope for, with staunch tartaric acidity. Jammy berry flavors are big but standard, as is the finish. Drink through 2018.
Crunchy and somewhat bitter, this has tight citrus rind flavors and a whiff of vanilla. A small percentage of the blend spent a bit of time in neutral oak.
Fruity and simple, with pie-filling flavors of pineapples, apricots, peaches and honeysuckle. Shows good coastal acidity, but could use greater depth and complexity.
Tastes kind of overripe, with raisin and blackberry flavors. Finishes with a flourish of sticky tannins. Best with meats and cheeses.
An attractive, rich style of Brunello with loads of aromatic intensity. There's cherry liqueur, rum cake, cola, toasted almond, savory spice, cured meat and tobacco. A pure, clean, long, silky close displays good structure and acidity. Drink after 2016.
Nicolas Joly and his mother are possessors of the smallest appellation in France: Coulée de Serrant. This almost vertical vineyard, dropping down to the Loire, facing due south, makes a mythical wine that is powerful and laden with exotic fruit flavors: oranges, lemon, apricots, accented with spices and the tannins of a youthful white wine. This will last for decades. Imported by Vintus.
This beautiful wine has aromas as ripe as dried figs, flavors as deep as blackberries falling off the vine, and a welcoming, broad texture that begs for another sip. While full bodied, it's easy to relax into.
Round, floral and sweet smelling, with citrusy acidity that pushes up passion fruit, orange and lemon flavors. There's weight and body come finishing time, and the overall impression is that of a tropical, dense white wine with some creaminess. Priced high for what you get.
Warm, fragrant and juicy, this is an off-dry, just peppery wine, full of ripe peach and pear flavors. Very fruity and delicious.
A wine that shows plenty of herbaceous character, very fresh and crisp. There is an attractive lemon zest tang along with apricot and melon. Screwcap.
Sour cherry and brown sugar aromatics introduce this wine, with comparable flavors that thin out rather quickly. Hints of clay and wet fur show as well. It's an unusual, but interesting, wine that may improve with more bottle age.
Very oaky right off the bat, with unintegrated aromas of fresh-cut wood. The green apple flavors are tart and highly acidic, while the oak integration has barely begun. It's big, acidic, clean and oaky, but offers little in the way of depth or pleasure.
The nose needs air but as it wakes up, subtle notes of fragrant baked peach rise. On the palate a streak of lemon freshness provides both frame and direction, alongside a lovely apple-skin texture. Made from a blend of Riesling, Pinot Gris and Gewürztraminer this unites the virtues of each variety. This is full of life and impresses with its great precision and freshness. The finish is bone dry. Lovely now but will age. Drink now through 2025.
This shows excellent balance of sweet fruit and honey flavors. Bright acidity sparkles on the finish, adding crispness that makes this wine perfect for cream-based desserts.
Pineapple and other tropical fruits comprise the simple, straightforward nose. Pear and tangerine flavors come across sharp, as does the finish. The wine is a bit edgy and lean on its own.
This blend of 71% Chardonnay, 23% Viognier and 6% Sauvignon Blanc offers good concentration and ample richness, with pure yet powerful aromas and flavors of wood-grilled apple, peach pit, beeswax and yellow melon rind. Accents of toasted challah and pressed yellow flowers add depth to the bouquet, while finishing touches of orange oil and sweet spice unfold on the round, lush finish. Drink now–2018.
As luscious as this Viognier is with tropical fruit, green apple, apricot and honey flavors, it's so ripe and rich that repeated sips become cloying. Brisk acidity helps to balance things out.
Basic and fresh, yet not very individual in its aromas or flavors. The nose is your standard mineral and snappy citrus, while the palate offers nice apple, lemon and grapefruit flavors. It's more of tangy, cleansing wine than anything deep or cerebral. Drink now with salads or grilled shrimp.
Polished and varietal, this shows the skills of winemaker Chuck Reininger. The 2006 vintage produced tight, hard-edged, herbal wines, ageworthy but unyielding. But here it has been honed and softened, so that its Bordeaux-like traits are emphasized, with plenty of herbal character and spicy purple fruits. Still coming out of its shell, this is a wine to cellar and drink with a big, grilled steak.
This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon is aged in 85% new oak, and it shows the essence of Oakville in its dry, tannic, ripe and complex identity. It would be hard to exaggerate the excellence of the blackberries, black currants, black cherries, dark chocolate and oak flavors, which have a Christmas-pudding-like headiness. A hint of raisin suggests it approaches overripeness, yet it maintains superb control. The tannins and overall balance should help this age for many years, but it can also be consumed now.
As in this producer's '97 Croce Riserva, an even palate-feel is among the best features here. The aromas and flavors are very dark and the oak quite dense. A core of sour black-plum fruit wears mild vanilla accents and the balance is attractive. Pleasing and stylish.
Meaty, savory aromas, and lush, dense cherry and berry flavors put a lot of personality into this medium-bodied, ripe and luxurious-feeling wine. It's effusive enough to fill the mouth and satisfy the taste buds, but still dry enough for great balance.
A fine, solid Pinot, showing the tart acidity, delicate silkiness and tight structure of the coast, in a wine to drink now. The flavors are flashy and complex, with sour cherry candies, cranberries and toasty oak.
Muscular and broad, a massive wine packed with fruity power, but lacking some finesse. Floods the palate with the essence of red cherries, with delicious, pastry tastes of baked tart, raspberry nut granola, honey and red licorice. Drink now for freshness and vivacity.
Another excellent component of the Vietti portfolio, this elegant Barbaresco is scented by wild sage, dried mint, cigar box and rose petal. A wine capable of a long and complex evolution in the glass with clearly etched tannins over a lean body.
Expansive body and a undulating, textural palate set this dry Riesling apart. The palate is juicy yet elegant, full of ripe, concentrated white grapefruit and lime flavors. Fresh yet powerful, it finishes on lingering notes of earth and smoke. Drink now through 2030.
This has aromas of white flowers, especially honeysuckle, and flavors of lemon custard, guava and lemon rind. The finish is rounded yet crisp.
Zinfandel is joined by Mourvèdre and a few other minor grape varieties in this overtly sweet, high alcohol wine. It's soft and glyceriney, with cherry, blueberry, dark chocolate and pepper flavors. You have to give it credit for being true to its style.
This is a bright Greco, with subdued aromas of stone fruit, melon and honey. It shows very nice richness and consistency overall.
This opens with mature plum and vanilla aromas. The dense, simple palate shows mocha, toast and prune flavors, with rounded tannins. Drink through 2018.
A superb value, this wine's weighty presence and rich texture convey the warmth of the Barossa without ever stepping over into overripeness. Instead, it delivers mixed berry fruit, peppery spice and overtones of vanilla and chocolate. Drink now and over the next few years.
This vintage of La Grola opens with impressive intensity and richness of texture that spreads generously over the palate. This food-friendly Italian red makes a lasting impression thanks to its beautiful aromas of black fruit, spice, toasted nut, cola and tobacco.
This wine continues a long-standing tradition, showing a mastery of the art of blending. It's made using grapes that are sourced from at least six vineyards scattered from Yountville to St. Helena. Right out of the bottle, it's a soft, smoothly tannic wine that's rich in blackberry jam, black currant, blueberry, raspberry, dark chocolate and spice flavors. The wine, which contains small amounts of Petit Verdot and Malbec, is so powerful, it easily carries the 100% new French oak. Just gorgeous now, and it should develop bottle complexity for at least the next 10 years.
Bright, fresh raspberry fruit takes the center stage in this young and still rather tight wine that will reward further cellaring. There's a hint of metal in the acids. Drink 2020–2030.
This Reserve requires the faith of a true believer in its future. It's awkward now, a tannic, very new-oaky wine with jammy black currant flavors, and seems all over the place. We know from long experience that CDV Cabs age terrifically, and this one might. Best after 2012, and could improve a great   deal.
Fruit flavors of blue plum and blueberry are matched to a light layer of chocolate from aging in 30% new French oak. It's smooth and polished, but feels a bit stripped as it fades out, leaving some orange-flavored acidity.
From one of the two properties owned by the Mulliez family of Château Belle-Vue, this wine is full of dense tannins as well as black currants. It is likely to develop into a rich although always firm wine. Drink from 2020.
Smells a bit musty and earthy, tastes overly sweet and sharp in acids, like raspberry jelly. Drink now.
Honeyed apples and pears mark the nose of this sweet but balanced auslese. Tasting it reveals hints of dried apricots, cool mint and an earthy minerality, all tied up in a clean, crisp finish. Imported by Chapin Cellars.
On the outside this is all soft, generous round fruit. In the core, though, there is a strong acid, perfumed fruit character, which suggests aging potential. Now the two components need to come together.
Tomato, savory spice and earthy, mildly stewed red-fruit aromas lead to a crisp palate with firm acids and flavors of tomato, raspberry, herbs, vanilla and dried cheese. Lasting but light on the finish. Contains 30% Gracianio, which helps explain the sheer, red-fruit character.
This beautifully reflects the vintage as well as the place. There is astonishing density, length and detail—as much as any Syrah in the country. The deep, compact and impossibly complex flavors mix notes of black fruit, cassis, licorice, coffee, baking spice, smoke and Bourbon barrel.
A Gamay-based wine from one of the leading Morgon producers. Soft tannins, red cherry flavors and a touch of banana are enlivened by fine acidity on the finish.
The aromas bring light notes of corn husk and apple. This wine is broad in feel, with a lightly creamy texture full of roasted-corn flavors.
A sweetly floral nose wraps around you with the intensity of the Gewürztraminer grape, suggesting orange, perfume and spice. It's sweet enough to serve with a fruit-based dessert, though not sugary in any way.
Shows jammy but somewhat simple cherry candy and mint flavors, the kind that come from young vines. Plenty of tart acidity scours the mouth, creating balance to the fruit. Ultimately, this is a Pinot Noir for drinking soon.
This rich, reddish-orange wine has aromas like sour-cherry candy. Tasty, dry and complex fruit flavors suggest cherry, cranberry and tamarind, with a smooth texture and full body. It's made from 74% Grenache and 25% Mourvèdre.
Characteristically perfumed, this Pinot Gris is full bodied with a richness of texture. It is complex on the palate with notes of nuts, spice and an edge of citrus fruit. Age this wine and don't drink before 2016.
Not really dry, but with an edge of honeyed sweetness to the raspberries, limes, vanilla and doughy flavors. Drink this clean, brisk wine with fresh fruit or butter cookies.
An affordable blend that is almost 60% Malbec, the rest Cabernet Sauvignon, Franc and Syrah. It drinks well, smooth and polished, and the rough tannins that can often overtake the fruit in this region have been nicely managed here, pulling the wine into balance. Strawberry and light black cherry, some herb and tar, and good grip for an everyday red.
Randall Grahm's blend of 55% Roussanne, 26% Grenache Blanc and 19% Picpoul Blanc shows sliced honeydew, wet stone and a flash of topicality on the delicate nose. The mouthfeel is steely with layers of tense energy, showing lime pith and faint green banana, as well as lemon blossoms lasting long on the finish.
Stalky, lean wine, with fresh black currant flavors and tight tannins, without great depth.
Like all the Gimonnet wines, this is very dry, relying for its richness on the ripe Chardonnay (much of it grand cru from Cramant). This is crisp and clean, with pink grapefruit flavors that give it a lift and liveliness, and a fresh green aftertaste.
This spent 18 months in neutral American oak, and has a strong woody scent and flavor. Light melon and cucumber fruit remains somewhat buried, and the mouthfeel is soft and diffuse. Drink up.
Apple and honeydew aromas show on the nose of this boxed wine, which prides itself on having a small eco-footprint. The palate is flatter than the nose, with green apple skin flavors but not much texture or acidity to speak of.
A prime example of what Margaret River is capable of, this is a full-bodied, supple yet tannic Cabernet Sauvignon at a fair price. Notes of cedar, cassis and mocha offer ample interest, finishing rich and chewy. Drink 2013–2020.
The texture stands out on this dry, balanced wine. It's all velvet and silk in the mouth, almost like Pinot Noir, but everything else screams Zinfandel. The flavors are wild and exuberant, of innumerable wild berries, pepper, licorice and sweet, smoky bacon. Should develop over the next four years.
The wine has acidity and a rustic flavor that gives character. With a lemon streak, it is a fruity, juicy wine, always with an earthy aftertaste.
A ripe and opulent Champagne with intense white and yellow fruit flavors. The wine is full bodied, with just a touch of toast to show approaching maturity. This is a wonderfully open and generous wine.
This wine's strawberry jam aromas lead to a palate dominated by tannins. It's dry and missing fruit.
Flavorful and dry, offering jammy cherries, black raspberries and oak, with an earthier hint of cola and mushrooms. It's a silky, medium-bodied wine that could develop bottle complexity with 5 or 6 years of age.
Situated on the east coast of Corsica, this vineyard is 50 hectares. The wine is ripe, full in the mouth and refreshingly fruity. There is a touch of spice as well as great waves of fresh acidity.
Tart and sappy, this compelling wine wraps its bright raspberry and cherry fruit in a veil of citrus and caramel. The various flavors entwine gracefully, with excellent balance and length. It's still young and forward, with primary flavors, but has the potential to age over the next decade.
The Herdade da Boavista vineyard has produced a serious powerful wine. It has dark tarry tannins with concentrated black fruits and a dense structure. It is big and solid in all senses, while still keeping a surprising amount of elegance with its fresh fruits and juicy aftertaste. Drink from 2018.
Defines Carneros in its rich, nuanced aromas of fig, ripe peach, tangerine, nutmeg and oaky vanilla. Winemaker-induced complexities from barrel fermentation and lees aging. Tremendous depth of flavor, it just sings on the palate and is so rich and spicy. The ultralong finish is sweet and satisfying.
Aromas of French oak, coconut, blackcurrant, exotic spice and a whiff of grilled bell pepper lead the nose. The firm palate offers cassis, licorice, espresso and chewing tobacco alongside fine-grained tannins.
Here's a clean and tonic Moscato d'Asti from the Santo Stefano Belbo area of the Astigiano (a first-rate growing area) that shows lively aromas of honey, peach and white flower. It shows great harmony and personality and is capped by lovely, creamy foam.
Fruity and fragrant, this rich and complex wine also has a strong sense of acidity. Putting it all together, the wine has weight, aging potential and a fine, zesty, tight texture. It needs to age, so drink this fascinating wine from 2016.
Savory, smoky aromas of blackberry, blueberry and latex lead to a rubbery feeling palate with full tannins and chewy, extracted weight. Earthy, loamy flavors of blackberry, chocolate and buttery oak finish rich, with a mossy flavor, big tannins and length. Drink through 2019.
Smells herbaceous and weedy, with lots of green, stalky notes and just the barest trace of berry fruit. The flavors are pretty much the same, thin and austere, with a solid dose of tannins. It's well made, but there's not a whole lot to like here.
From a multi-aspected, redwood-surrounded site with peeks of the Pacific Ocean, Stuller traffics in aromas of baked bread and strawberry preserves, its acidity high-toned and full of freshness. Still young and looking for further development in the glass, it's savory and soft, aged in once-to-four-times used French oak.
Given time in stainless steel only, this is a crisp, lightly golden-colored wine forceful in apple, apricot and pear. Medium in weight and acidity, its vibrant refreshment lingers melodically on the palate.
A tight note of spearmint defines the nose. The palate follows suit: It's pinched and hard, with outsized acidity leading to a lemony palate, with searing cherry and red plum flavors. It doesn't waiver on the finish.
Bready, slightly oxidized aromas of yeasty white fruits, vanilla and brine are challenging. In the mouth, this is juicy and intense, with green herbs, brine and pithy citrus flavors. A slightly pickled tasting finish hints at sauerkraut and bitter lime. Prior wines from this producer were better.
The heart of the Gimonnet vineyards is in the Côte des Blancs. This bone-dry, very crisp Chardonnay is intense in its acidity and tight texture. Like many wines that are so dry, it needs to age to allow its almost shocking freshness to soften. It will always be a wine for food. Drink from 2018.
A 100% varietal wine from a warm region in a warm year, this discloses a thick, rich and syrupy aspect to the layers of soft tannin and dense blackberry fruit. It calls for pairing with meaty dishes.
Very herbal Sauvignon Blanc, crisp and tangy, with flavors of lime and green apple skins. Fresh as well as structured, with a final zest of acidity.
This young wine offers aromas of underbrush and mushroom, along with evident oak and toasted notes. The palate is still rather closed but reveals oak, plum, espresso and coffee flavors. It's tightly knit, with astringent wood tannins that linger through the close.
Opens with latex and mint scents that yield to cherry and plum aromas. Grabby and acidic in the mouth, with quick, racy plum and raspberry flavors. Juicy but not all that tasty or interesting. A generic style of RDD.
Locked down by hard tannins, this nonetheless is a beautiful Zinfandel, dry and rich in flavor. It bursts with savory wild berry, tobacco, mocha and pepper flavors, and feels elegant and refined. The tannins call for enormously rich beef, pasta, sauces and cheeses.
An overpowering aroma of cured meat on the nose recalls walking into an Italian deli, something one associates more readily with Cal-Ital varieties. Super tannic on the palate, the wine is slightly bitter and perhaps underripe.
Soft, sweet and simple, with chocolate-covered cherry and orange cola flavors.
A very rich Chardonnay, explosive in lemon custard, grilled pineapple and the ripest peaches imaginable. At the same time, there's a firm, tangy minerality. Some will find, however, that the oak dominates it all with a blast of buttered toast and caramel.
This 60-40 blend provides excellent value at this price. It's full-bodied but silky-soft in texture, with aromas and flavors that range from plum to earth and cola to dried spices. The tannins melt away on the palate, leaving behind a long, mouthwatering finish. Drink now.
This medium-bodied red opens with aromas of red berry, tilled earth, underbrush and dried herb. The firm palate doles out black cherry, plum, licorice and crushed mint alongside modest acidity and fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2017.
Marked by potent aromas of green apple and lime sherbet, this is an intense, flavorful Riesling that just lacks that little bit of finesse. It's dry and medium-bodied, with a slightly oily, slightly coarse texture. Drink it young.
While the producer does have vines in Volnay, this wine comes from the negociant side of the business. The wine has structure and some firm tannins. At this stage, the Volnay roundness lies behind the dry surface. But it does have weight and the potential to age well. Drink from 2021.
Jet-black aromatics of creosote, charred meats, pepper and plum-blackberry jam make an excellent entry point for this wine from a vineyard in the new Ballard Canyon appellation. Blackberry sauce leads the palate, with espresso bitterness and strong acidity throughout. A powerful but beautiful Syrah.
Supple and firm, the only word for this exceptionally smooth, sexy Cabernet is suave. It's delicious and silky, pure varietal, blended from a mix of top vineyards. The wine is a portrait of grace and power, folding its berry and cassis fruit into layers of smoke, toast, ash and char. A suggestion of cigar runs through the finish, and this is a wine that is sure to reward   further cellaring.
Woodsy, savory, plummy aromas and rather light cherry and black-tea flavors give this wine complexity. It's medium bodied, easy to drink and enjoy, especially at such a reasonable price.
Easy and fresh, this wine shows a natural ability to pair with most pastas or meat-based dishes. The finish is driven by smooth tannins and bright, berry-like freshness.
Pommery's nonvintage is very much in the light, feathery house style. It is a wine that floats in the mouth, aided by a fine mousse. The finish is soft, with delicate acidity.
A rich, ripe Cabernet, forward in blackberry and cherry jam flavors. A hint of dried herb grounds it and provides a level of complexity, as does a touch of smoky cedar from oak barrel aging. It's not an ager, but it is fancy and delicious now.
A hugely purple Petite with layers of black pepper, bacon fat, cedar and earth. It's chewy and inky but in balance; its tannin structure is as thick as walls yet the wine's stewy plum goodness goes down easy.
For a basic Chardonnay, this fits the bill. Citrus and peach aromas are standard and clean. The palate is tight and juicy, with no overt oak feel. Flavors of melon and pear have light spice and vanilla accents, while the finish is crisp.
Full and dark, with aromas of bacon, crusty minerality, black fruits and spice. Balanced yet bullish, with integrated tannins and toasty, coffee-infused flavors that go straight to black. Long and showing additional coffee on the finish. Drinkable now.
Delicately scented, this inviting sparkler offers light aromas of white and yellow stone fruit along with a whiff of bread crust. The creamy, slightly sweet palate tastes of white peach, candied citrus peel and ripe apple set against a soft, frothy mousse. Bright acidity refreshes the rich flavors while a glazed-almond note graces the close.
Intense rose, iris and aromatic herb aromas are the highlight of this wine. The palate isn't as expressive, offering raw sour cherry, powdered sage and excruciatingly astringent tannins that dry out the mouth. It lacks the fruit richness needed to stand up to the oak.
A friendly, robust Zinfandel, rich in peppery spices, with raspberry and cherry flavors that have a touch of briary nettles and sugared chamomile tea. A delightful Zin to drink now.
Relatively closed up at this stage, not giving much, this wine is all about freshness, poised but rich fruit and a structure that suggests long-term development. The wood is quite prominent, overshadowing what will be delicious yellow-fruit flavors. Come back to this wine in five years—it will be magnificent.
This vintage of Menfri (a “super Sicilian” blend of Nero d'Avola, Tannat and Cabernet Sauvignon) seems to have suffered from summer heat. The wine tastes jammy and sweet with aromas of prunes, plums and raisins.
Tropical aromas of melon, pineapple juice and canned pears are friendly. A fresh palate with minimal depth and weight offers simple apple and white-grape flavors prior to a lean, melony tasting finish.
Produced in microscopic quantities (50 cases), snap up this Cal-Ital if you can, strong in red cherry fruit and integrated tannins. Soft and smooth, it's a fine food wine with enough structure and acidity to hold up to creamy cheeses and red sauces, an herbal-leathery note on the finish.
This is a crisp fruity wine with delicious red currants. It has fine acidity as well, with a burst of freshness in the midst of the spicy, ripe wine. Drink this attractive wine now.
Minerally, dry and clean white wine made from 60% Xarello and 40% Chardonnay. The nose is peachy, while the palate is spritzy and bouncy, with short, slightly creamy apple, melon and papaya flavors that are true to Xarello. Finishes smooth but a little flat.
Aromas of brick dust, sweet spice, rubber and leather are good if you're not seeking saturated berry fruit, while the palate is starchy and grabby, with flavors of stewed berry, tomato, leather and earth. Raspberry is detectable on the thin finish, but so is a soupy flavor. Decent wine with some faults.
This full-bodied Shiraz isn't that complex, but it's immediately gratifying for its lashings of vanilla and blackberry fruit. Lush and oaky, it fits the mold of many steakhouse reds.
This wine is made in decent quantities, enough to hopefully find, and that's good news, given its quality for the price. Juicy, spicy and just the right amount of herbal, it has sizzling acidity that livens and refreshens the palate, dotted in chocolate-covered cherry, plum and clove.
Creamy in texture and deceptively easy to drink, this Barossa Shiraz features a veneer of baking spices and vanilla layered over a fruity foundation of ripe blueberries. Drink it over the next several years.
So delicious, so drinkably good, it defines the beauty of great coastal Syrah. A bit high in alcohol, but the heat fits in well beside the white and black pepper notes, and gives a lift to the vast blackberry, cassis, bacon and sandalwood flavors. Drink now through 2014.
A bit lighter in body and fruitier in style than the very similar 2009 Kirchenschlüssel, this dry Riesling displays crisp apple and citrus flavors alongside deeper, earthier, more savory notes.
Dark berry and trademark South African smoke comprise the nose and the flavors of this wine from this historic Stellensbosch producer, and while the tannins are soft, the wine has enough complexity to hold its own against heartier dishes. There's some exotic spice on the palate too, offering an interesting extra facet to the wine.
An acidic, drily harsh, peppery wine. Even for a Foothills Zinfandel, it's pretty rustic, with an old-fashioned toughness that requires plenty of olive oil, mozzarella and rich beef to mellow.
There sure is a lot of ripe flavor in this Pinot, which swamps the tastebuds with raspberries, cherries, vanilla and sweet oak. It's basically a dry wine, with smooth tannins, but it is deficient in acidity. That steals some liveliness, and makes the richness taste flat.
Reserve is their version of a classic Bordeaux blend; this vintage pencils out as 48% Cabernet Sauvignon, 37% Merlot, the rest split evenly between Cab Franc and Petit Verdot. Sweet black cherry fruit is married seamlessly to layers of different flavored chocolates; long, silky, seamless and seductive. Styled for near-term enjoyment.
Chards from this vineyard always show a typicity of intensely ripe citrus and tropical fruits, backed with bracing acidity and a stony minerality. This bottling threatens to go over the top in apricot sorbet that may have a touch of botrytis, but it wisely pulls back into balance at the last moment. Will gradually lose fruit over the next 10 years, becoming nuttier and drier.
This Zin contains percentages of Petite Sirah, Sangiovese and Grenache, offering powerfully dusty tannins and layers of blackberry. Chewy, the finish is all leathery saddle.
Enticing aromas like baking spices and a vivid mix of fruit and spice flavors are carried along beautifully by lively acidity matched with luxurious body. This tastes subtly and attractively oaky and has considerable complexity and length.
Prominent aromas of toast, dried cranberry, herb and cherry lead to straight down the fairway to more cranberry flavor. It delivers a lot of appeal.
Vines over 45-years-old in the most northerly vineyard in Givry are the source of this rich smooth wine. It has a fine combination of blackberry fruits and pointed acidity that gives it a great lift. The balance is just right: the tannins comfortably part of the ripe fruitiness. Drink this wine from 2018.
Full in the mouth, this rich wine is dominated by yellow fruits and ripe apricots lifted by a touch of toast. Great acidity conveys a fresh and tangy character. The wine is still developing as the full fruitiness comes forward. Drink from 2017.
Aromas of pear, pressed white flower, exotic fruit and hints of toasted oak lead the nose. The round palate offers nectarine zest, apricot, dried herb and vanilla alongside soft but refreshing acidity.
Shows the upfront fruit and oak of the popular style of Chardonnay, but earns extra points for dryness, acidity, creaminess and minerality. The fruit veers toward delicious pineapples. Drink now with rich shellfish, Ahi tuna, lobster risotto.
An oddity—Cabernet Franc made as a white wine. It tastes delicious, with a feeling of sweetness, with soft lychee and spiced apple flavors, balanced acidity and a lively juicy texture.
This wine is a blend of Merlot (63%), a whopping 22% Petit Verdot and 15% Cabernet Sauvignon. Aromas of smoke, cedar, dried herbs, licorice, pencil lead, crushed flowers and red and black berries are followed by soft, plump fruit flavors. It brings an undeniable warm vintage appeal but with a compelling sense of elegance and balance.
Vibrant and balanced, this luminous wine offers alluring scents of rose, red berry, baking spice and a delicate whiff of new leather. The fresh, elegant palate is loaded with juicy strawberry, wild cherry, white pepper and star anise alongside firm but ultrarefined tannins. Drink 2018–2025.
Deep black cherry in the glass, this wine has a fruit-forward nose of raspberry and watermelon. Flavors of tart cherry and cranberry are quickly overcome by tannins that are a little too stiff for their own good.
From the major Loire producer, this fresh and fruity wine shows the light touch of the region. With red-currant fruit sliced right through with acidity, the wine is lightly textured and ready to drink.
Spice and jam get it going, but then it turns more grassy and lean. Cranberry and pie cherry are the lead flavors, and the feel is kind of raw and hard. Almost refreshing in its steeliness, but ultimately it's pretty thin.
Dominated by rich Chardonnay, this is a ripe wine. Acidity and a mineral texture are foils to the rich apple and green-plum flavors, giving a balance between deliciously crisp and a fuller style. It is just about ready to drink but will be better from 2018.
An obviously wood aged wine, giving more toast than fruit at this stage. It does have the weight to promise aging and the fruit to give a succulent feel. But with the heavy toast flavors, this potentially impressive wine will need several years to fill and round out.
Packed with delicious, ripe blackberry and blueberry flavors, this is a concentrated and full-bodied wine, with fine-grained tannins. Very tasty now with fatty cheeses and meats, it will improve through at least 2020.
Blended from the Laguna, Del Rio and Two Rock vineyards, this tangy white is balanced and bright in preserved lemon, honey, ginger and caramel. The back beat conveys citrus and mellowed oak.
A tangy grapefruit flavor and refreshing acidity make this a good before-dinner quaff and an apt pairing with seafood. Herbaceous and citrus aromas carry through to the flavors, medium body and good balance.
This blend of 80% Grenache, 10% Syrah and 10% Mourvèdre is plump and charming, filled with cherry fruit and just a hint of spice. It's clean and correct, a fine option for everyday drinking.
Funky, heavily pickled aromas lack clarity, charm and cleanliness. This feels flat as a board, with bitter sour nutty flavors of spoiled citrus fruits. A sour, murky finish fails to help it along.
Distant aromas of melon, lemon and apricot are subtle and fail to stir the pot. This feels weighty, with pithy flavors of peach, papaya and melon. On the finish, flavors of white pepper and bitterness take over.
There's a lot of mature fruit and some strawberry jam here backed by prunes, raisins, tobacco, incense and cola. Pretty nuances of white stone and dried hay appear on the nose and the wine ends with sweet, sticky flavors of ripe berry.
Full, fat, ripe, perfumed wine that is full of rich red fruits, plums and strawberries. It also has a stylish structured with refined tannins as well as a dense texture. It's a wine for aging over at least 5–7 years.
An opulence of mouthfeel is highly plump and pleasing in this deeply textural Pinot Gris. It's dry in style, but lush and fruity, drenching the palate in grapefruit and white peach flavors. Nuanced by hints of chalk and oyster shell, it's a complex, satisfying wine brightened with zesty lime acidity.
This wine has soft fruit, a creamy texture and light acidity. It is balanced, fruity with apple and spice flavors. The aftertaste introduces a drier, woody character that is less attractive.
Among the single-vineyard 2008 Pinots from Rex Hill, this is the lightest in flavor and style. Ripe strawberry fruit, medium-bodied, is buttressed with generous natural acidity. Highlights of fresh-cut herbs dot the finish.
While there is plenty of new wood influence in this wine, it also has delicious fruit. The combination results in a juicy flavor of black stone fruit, with good acidity to accompany the toast and smoked meat flavors. Age for 3–4 years.
Quite light in the glass, this bottling by James Sparks of Liquid Farm fame shows cherry, hibiscus, cola and a touch of garrigue on the delicate nose. There is a noticeable tannic structure to the sip, where red-cherry and rose-petal flavors are quite mellow, refreshing and very quaffable. Time may add more complexity, but it's fun and lively now.
Soft and crisp, this is light in texture and very fragrant. It boasts intense strawberry flavors, with already well-integrated tannins and a smooth, easy finish.
Bortoluzzi's Sauvignon is a fragrant and crisp wine with pretty aromas of exotic fruit, chopped herbs and drying minerals. The mouthfeel is lean and smooth and the wine delivers a pinch of tangy spice on the close.
This is a mature, jammy wine with thick layers of plum, prune and raisin. The wine's appearance is dark and concentrated and that same sensation of heaviness carries over the palate in the form of black currant and spice. The tannins are firm and tart.
A big chunky wine, its sweetness masked by continuing tannins and layers of wood aging. The wine shows figs, is dry and firm, but the richness is still there, although spirit is prominent in the aftertaste.
This wine seems to be a casualty of the cold vintage, with thin fruit and overall earthy flavors. A whiff of barnyard is evident as well.
Gavin Chanin's take on this vineyard shows lots of dark but never heavy spice on the nose, with bergamot, white sage and damp eucalyptus forest complementing the raspberry fruit. The palate clings to a line of graphite minerality, with cooked raspberry torte and loamy earth flavors leading into a black-tea finish.
Equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon and Touriga Nacional, this is a big, ripe and rich wine. Tannins are well integrated into the juicy black currant fruits. Wood aging has added to the density of this wine that is now ready to drink.
Sweet and unbalanced, but this blend of Cab, Syrah and Petite Sirah is clean, and will have its fans.
Fairly bold and ripe up front, with dark berry aromas and an almond candy undercurrent. The palate is a bit more red-fruit based than the bouquet, and the flavors of raspberry and red plums are satisfying a touch tangy. Interesting, with drying tannins on the finish.
This is Baldacci's regular Cab, although most wineries would be content for it to be their reserve. It's a powerful, rich young wine, massive in blackberry, currant and oak flavors, with a succulent edge of milk chocolate. The tannins are pure Stags Leap, giving a complex contrapuntal balance of grip and structure to the opulent fruit. Just fabulous in every aspect, a wine to dazzle. Drink now through 2010, at least.
A fine combination of wood and ripe, tropical fruits lead to a crisp, fruity more herbaceous core. There is a great balance between this richness and citrus herbaceousness. It will certainly age several years.
The wine is soft, smooth and full of rich berry fruits. The blend of Aragonez, Trincadeira and Alicante Bouschet gives a warm southern feel: ripe wine, sunshine and soft tannins. Wood aging has smoothed the bold fruits and created a full generous aftertaste. Drink now.

This is a big ripe wine full of juicy sweet plum flavors and dark dense tannins. It is still young with a bitter edge from the toasty wood aging. The wine, with its structure and firm texture, will need more time so drink from 2017.
This is quite a dynamic and layered wine, especially for the bargain price, with deep and hearty blackberry, caramel, rust, lavender and potpourri on the nose. The berry-led palate is rustic and unrefined, with feral flavors, peppery spice and decent acidity.
Dark and ominous in color, with a grapy, rustic, smoky nose, this Garnacha is high in acid, rubbery and tannic on the palate. Semisour black-plum flavors finish equally tannic and acidic.
This is a perfumed wine, with attractive acidity and a light, fruity body. The wine is lively and soft; the raspberry acidity shows through on the finish.
Lemelson makes a consistent lineup of single vineyard Pinots, and with a track record extending back a decade or more, the results are predictably satisfying. The Meyer has a solid core of blackberry and black cherry, highlighted with a lining of licorice, scents of dried herb and citrusy acids. Beautifully styled and riding on perfectly ripened fruit, it will be hard to keep your hands off it, but it can cellar for 5–6 more years.
A little raisiny, not too much, and a little sweet, but again, not too much. Straddles the line on both. Raspberries, cherries, and an earthiness. Lots of personality here.
The aim here seems to be to avoid ripe, opulent fruit in favor of an elegantly streamlined wine you might call Chablisian. The result is bone dry, high in aciditiy and lean, with mineral and citrus flavors. This is against the grain these days for fruity Chards.
This Syrah-dominant blend with 12% Grenache, 10% Cabernet Sauvignon, 7% Cinsault and 2% Viognier offers a delicious, fruit-driven core matched with complex spice notes of sweet smoke, cured meat and fresh tobacco leaf. The mouth is silky and smooth with fine-grain tannins and a white pepper-flecked finish. Drink now–2012.
This serious, complex selection features a lively mousse. It balances ripe yellow and white fruits with powerful acidity. It is rounded with some bottle age, which gives it a toasty character. Drink now or age for several years.
Fresh and crisp, this citrusy wine is bright with lemon and young green fruit flavors. The palate is light with a hint of spice. Wait until mid-2015 to let the extreme youth mature.
Texture rather than aroma is the main appeal of this slender white. The nose is restrained but the palate has spicy hints of pepper. While citrus dominates, it also shows a riper notion of tangy passion fruit.
One of the finest selections from South Africa today, Sadie's 2011 Columella is structured, complex and masterfully balanced, ready for a beautiful, long life ahead. The bouquet leads with lovely scents of rooibos tea, minty fynbos and African violets that frame the ripe boysenberry, blackberry and plum fruit spine. Layers of lush black fruit and earthy spice dance on the velvety palate, with peppery tannins that hang on to the lingering finish alongside hints of cocoa powder, licorice root and star anise. Drink now–2024.
From Clare Ranch Vineyard in the Templeton Gap, this bottling by Ryan Render shows rounded notes of boysenberry and cooked blackberry on the nose alongside strong licorice and mocha aromas.

An upfront, strawberry-flavored wine, this is ripe and immediately fruity. There are enough tannins to hold the palate together, but it is ready to drink now.

Caramel and vanilla aromas, the palate rounded, poised, with pear and green plum flavors, along with lively acidity, filled out with toast.
Made without oak fermentation or barrel aging, this wine is the essence of Santa Ynez fruit. It's savory and rich with lemons, limes, kiwis and oranges, as well as a touch of tart gooseberry.
Aromas of toast, oak, menthol and mint lead the nose. The palate shows raw red berry and dried sage alongside grainy tannins that leave a mouth-puckering finish.
Imagine honeyed orange sections—that's what the aromas of this wine call to mind. In the mouth, there's plenty of sweetness and power and a rich, creamy mouthfeel, matched by strident acids. Orange, apple and spice flavors linger on the finish.
Showing some wood-aging aromas, this is a rich, tropical fruit-flavored wine balanced by acidity that goes with its peach and mango flavors. Ready to drink, it will be even better in 2015.
The best of Zaca Mesa's G-S-Ms, this is based on Grenache and Mourvèdre, with a drop of Syrah. It is softly delicious, with cherry pie, mocha and spice flavors, plus a hint of sweet-tasting, toasty oak. Drink now.
Half Cabernet Sauvignon, half Syrah. It has a funky open, with scents of latex and rubber that open into bubblegum. Light and fruity in the mouth, it is surprisingly simple.
This wine is delicious with its fresh, concentrated blueberry and raspberry flavors, and the ripest tannins. The wine has a dark and tannic element, although this is well integrated into its beautiful layers of fruit.
This wine offers aromas of white flowers, spice and citrus. On the palate are easygoing flavors of white fruit, flowers and minerally spice. A simply good white wine with a feminine touch.

Textured, dry rosé that reveals its rich character slowly. The Sumeire family, making wine at Coussin for 200 years, has mastered the production of a serious, food-friendly style of rosé.
This Bordeaux blend has a strong herbal streak and some chewy tannins. The heavy toast in past vintages has here been a bit subdued, but there is still plenty of smoke and coffee. I like the structure—the fruit is not too sweet, and the balance suggests that this wine may evolve some interesting nuances. Right now it's lightly herbal, tight, with hints of cinnamon and toast.
Produced from two parcels in Aloxe Corton, this structured wine has red-plum fruitiness that is still masked by a dry tannic coating. It has concentration and good potential. Drink this textured, firm wine from 2018.
We haven't seen much improvement in this wine since the 2003 vintage. It's still lacking forward, ripe fruit and instead shows more leather and drying, firm tannins. Shows glimpses of higher quality but can't support them.
From a steep, densely planted estate vineyard, this is a lilting regional example of well-integrated oak in support of black raspberry, licorice and chalky clove. Silky tannins mark it most, providing a balance to the fruit and a pronounced, entirely delectable bite of black pepper on the finish.
Soft and approachable, this seems more like a generic red than a pure Cabernet Sauvignon. It's quite ripe, ready to drink, and certainly smooth. What is not there is any particular varietal character or sense of place. This is a medium-bodied red that could be from anywhere.
Fermented in open lagars, this wine is luscious with wonderful depth of black fruit flavor, spice and acidity. It has hints of wood, although these are already well integrated into the ripe fruit. Age this wine for at least 3–4 years.
Only occasionally produced, this reserve-level wine is a bit of a mystery in this new vintage. It's tart and shy, its black fruit laced with assertive acidity and its finish excessively astringent.
Penfolds Bin 707 has leapt in quality over the past few vintages. The 2009 features hints of mint, cedar and vanilla accenting ripe cassis fruit. It's full bodied and rich, velvety without being overly soft, with a dusty tannic structure that should support it over two decades or more of aging. Drink 2015–2030+.
There's a sweet touch of ripe peach and pineapple here followed by fragrant citrus and tangerine skin. This is an easy expression of Pinot Grigio that shows soft peach notes on the close.
Raisin, pastry and plum aromas are smooth and generous given how cool 2013 was in Rioja. There's good acidity and body to go with flavors of plum, blackberry and toasty oak. Finishing notes of coffee, toast and chocolate are fully oaked, which lends a sense of sweetness to this Crianza.
Tighter and more citrusy than the regular Chardonnay, with the oak coming across as more restrained, although the proportion of new wood is undoubtedly higher. It's a subtly nutty, textural wine, with apple and lemon notes that linger on the finish.
Blackberry, herb, tobacco and a menthol note mark the nose of this full but not heavy red. The fruit is ripe, sweet and unburdened by excess oak. The long, juicy cherry and licorice finish sports no hard tannins. Lovely for drinking now.
At first, this wine seems fruity and direct, loaded with dark berry fruit. But over time, it develops more and more oak character, adding notes of cedar, vanilla and mint. It's creamy in texture, with silky tannins, but remains a bit woody on the finish.
The bouquet of dried cherries, plums, prunes and tobacco opens to a palate of dense fruit that's dry and structured. This wine is big, but even textured and not heavy. Shows finely focused fruit and good grip. The dark fruit flavors add spice accents on the long finish. Cellar Selection.
Aromas of French oak, toast, red berry and dark culinary spice emerge in the glass. The bracing full-bodied palate mirrors the nose, evoking sour cherry, licorice, toast and clove set against austere close-grained tannins that clench the finish. Give the tannins a few more years to soften then drink to capture the remaining fruit.
This ripe, complex wine offers a delicate combination of apple, lemon and honey, with a mineral texture. Balanced already although likely to age well, it is full of fruit, with a more steely texture at the end. Drink now for the fruit, but it will be better to wait until 2018.
Fermented in concrete tanks, using whole-clusters and wild yeast, this is not a mainstream wine. Light bodied and tangy, it has has aromas and flavors that recall sour cherries, plus earthy, meaty accents, prominent acidity and a firmly tannic finish.
Gold in color and on the dry, waxy side. Shows mineral and dried fruits on the nose, with heavy pear and apple bulking up the palate. Finishes short, with some pithy bitterness. But good overall, with a roundness that's appealing. Imported by South Valley Wines.
Il Concerto Brut is a tonic and tight Italian sparkler with dry aromas of lime, talc powder and crushed white pepper. The wine is fine, smooth and shows a touch of spice on the finish.
Clean, polished and fresh, this bright Nero d'Avola offers very nice balance between its fruity elements and drying mineral tones. There's a touch of chewy sweetness on the wine's easygoing finish.
Sweet and simple aromas of pear, apple and wood dust give this basic but respectable Chardonnay a solid nose. Apple, nectarine and mild sugary flavors are attractive in a familiar, ordinary way. And the feel and finish are round and regular. Perfectly good and acceptable in the category it plays in.
Lees aromas dominate on this wine along with almond butter, corn husk and spice. It's weighty in feel with abundant green apple, lees and cereal flavors leading to a lingering finish. The style gets a bit out in front of the variety but there's plenty of interest to be had.
Only just off dry, this is a crisp Champagne with a cookie-pastry flavor that balances fresh lemon and orange-zest flavors. While fine with food, this would be an excellent apéritif.
This is a tight, mineral single-vineyard wine coming from layered granite soil. Produced from organic grapes, it is crisp, tangy with lemon zest and light spice flavors and a strongly aromatic aftertaste. Drink this concentrated wine from 2017.
Smoke, yeast, earth and peppery herbs unite to make an almost archetypal Grüner. The palate has the same savory core but also introduces green and yellow pear to create a very harmonious, textured palate that just sings with spice and pepper.
A clean, dry, green-fruited wine that's juicy, citric, tangy and features pure orange, lemon and lime aromas and flavors. It's more of a quaffer than anything complex, but with fish or salads it should be just right. The blend is 70% Treixadura with multiple other white grapes including Torrontés, Godello and Albariño.
In this gold-colored wine, green-apple skin and nutmeg-ginger spice wrap around a full-bodied build, with a preponderance of ripe peach within its makeup too. Decadent, and nutty from the oak, it brings a fulsomeness of crème brûlée to the finish.
Oak and sur lie yeastiness play a big part in this dry Chardonnay's personality. The fruit veers toward tart lemons and limes, with just a hint of nectarine and guava. It feels tight and young in the mouth, so give it until 2014 to start expressing itself.
This Merlot is 100% varietal, a blend of Horse Heaven Hills, Yakima Valley and Walla Walla Valley fruit. A hint of leather is wrapped into tight, lightly smoky red fruit. Red licorice and a streak of iron ore can also be detected; it is unusually tight and muscular for Merlot.
Made with 100% Sangiovese, this opens with aromas of new wood, roasted coffee bean and menthol. The tired palate offers oak-driven spice and coconut but the fruit has completely dried up, leaving only evident alcohol and bitterly astringent tannins.
Along with the Lonesome Spring Ranch Sangiovese, the blend includes 25% Cabernet Sauvignon. It's still pulling itself together and needs some airing out, but shows accents of rose water along with strawberry-flavored fruit. The tannins are astringent and the acids tart and citrusy.
This Prosecco Extra Dry definitely boasts sweet, fruity tones of peach, melon and honey and backs those aromas with a creamy, frothy texture. It has piquant, lively effervescence and a crisp, citrusy finish. Col Vetoraz is located at the heart of Valdobbiadene's most celebrated cru.
From an organically farmed block planted entirely to the Pommard clone, this wine offers strawberry, earth and black tea, diluted slightly by a tannic underbite that competes with the fruit. Softly structured, it grips further on the finish.
A textured, tight wine, this offers some firm fruits. Berry flavors, plenty of acidity and a touch of minerality add to a wine that will need time to develop. Drink from 2018.
This is a tight young Cabernet, marked by fresh acidity and firm tannins. The vineyard sourcing is all southern Napa, from cooler mountain and flatland areas in this cool vintage. The wine, which has some Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, is nowhere near ready. Through the astringency, however, erupts a blast of blackberry, black cherry and cassis fruit, with an elaborate but tasteful coating of flashy new oak. Needs serious time. Should blossom after 2014, and develop for many years after.
A big wine, rather ponderous now in the size and forwardness of its fruit and the volume of mainly new French oak. The fruit is massive, suggesting black and red sour cherry candy, with oak influences of smoky char and pencil shavings, and complex notes of minerals and sweet violet flowers. But it all needs time to come together. Tasted in a large flight of 2007 Rutherford Cabernets and Bordeaux blends, this was easily the star. Really hard to exaggerate the wine's beauty and elegance. Best 2013–2019, at least.

Every time this wine hits the palate it registers as sheer and aggressive. And that's unfortunate because in past years TerraNoble had a way with Carmenère.

In the mouth, things run deep and thick, and any potential corpulence is balanced by ripe tannins and fresh acids. Imported by Empson (USA) Ltd.
As ripe as Donum's regular 2010 Russian River Pinot is, this reserve is even richer. It's certainly impressive for sheer power, but is too much of a good thing, flooding the mouth with so much soft, ripe, oaky raspberry and cherry flamboyance as to lose subtlety.

Rounded acidity recalls the freshness of green apple and pear rather than that of citrus. Very clean and streamlined but with pleasant substance and just a little enticing spritz. Simple but very pleasant.

This is Rick Longoria's Bordeaux-style blend. It's not at all like a Napa Cabernet, which is the inevitable comparison, but instead shows a crisp, white wine-like acidity, and an underlying herbaceousness, the result of the region's cool climate.

A dark, piercing opening with olive, black fruit and mild herbal aromas announces a ripe, full-force Malbec. That impression is confirmed on the full, creamy, jammy palate, where oaky, chocolaty flavors of syrupy blackberry and cooked brown sugar end in a smooth, vanilla-laden finish. Drink now through 2015.
Aromas of vanilla, prune and nutmeg lead the nose on this robust Merlot. The dense, monolithic palate offers raisin, leather and licorice alongside the heat of evident alcohol and drying tannins. It's shy on freshness and fruit richness so drink sooner rather than later.
Light to medium in body, with a fine, silky texture, this is a solid value Chardonnay. Modest apple and citrus flavors persist on the finish. Drink now.
The concerted impact of bergamot, grapefruit, tangerine and lemon is almost surreal—its headiness reaches long neglected memories of deep summer mingled with the freshness of the open sea. The intensity of spicy grapefruit and the skin of still-green Seville oranges transports you to utopian shores. That such flavor should come from grapes is one of nature's unresolved, eternal mysteries. That this should shine in such a concentrated, slender wine is a marvel.
This is your basic dry, ripe California Chardonnay. A little rustic, with decent fruit and a kiss of oak and cream.
The nose is like pear juice spilled onto warm earth, while the palate is more citrus-focused. A seam of almost tropical acidity links lemon to notes of pineapple, lifted by joyful freshness.
Along with its strawberry flavors, this wine is soft and dry, with structured, tangy acidity. Screwcap.
A wonderfully toasty, yeasty wine, with creamed apple fruits, flavors that show some softness but never deviate from a crisp, steely character. Although this wine is ready to drink, consider keeping for 3–4 years.
This rich wine is approaching maturity. Secondary animal aromas, dried fruit and richness are showing well, allowing this ripe wine to shine. The warm 2009 vintage comes out in the density and the dusty tannins. This is ready to drink.
This big, friendly wine shows ripe, forward scents of mixed citrus and light tropical fruits, along with toasted nuts. Medium-rich and already showing some aged, slightly oxidized character, it is definitely built for near-term drinking.
This spicy wine is full of botrytis, giving a dry edge to its rich, honeyed flavors. It has an intense character, hovering between very sweet and dry. Structured with strong acidity, it will be ready to drink from 2018.
Abundant layers of char and smoke threaten to overtake the bright black-cherry and green herb flavors on this premium wine. Aeration brings the fruit to the forefront, but hints of toasted wood and dill linger on the finish.
Here's a perfect go-to, every day Riesling for warm weather. Pretty fruit flavors of peach and apple are laced with orange pekoe tea. Medium-bodied and mouthfilling, it's got excellent length and structure.
Almost addictive with its fresh, clean flavors of sweet lemon, fig, tart green apple and cinnamon, encased in lively acidity. This zesty white wine has extra layers of complexity and depth. It's also one of the most versatile food wines around.
Production of this Chardonnay was cut way back in 2010, but the quality is as good as ever. It's an elegant wine, showcasing purity of fruit. Flavors of meyer lemon, citrus, orange peel and pretty apple abound. There is both balance and depth to the finish.
While the black currant fruit flavors are fresh enough, and there is a good fruity aftertaste, this is too light for the vintage, and the acidity tends to dominate.
Aromas of passion fruit and banana lead the nose. The simple palate offers tropical fruit and unripe apple alongside racy acidity.
They call it Shiraz instead of Syrah because it fits the stereotype of a young, jammy Aussie red. It's ferociously youthful, with blueberry and black cherry flavors that taste like they're fresh from the fermenting vats. A wine like this is sharp and edgy. But it's dry, and has a lot to like. —S.H.
This is easily one of the most delicious Cabernets of the year. The first sip dazzles, offering a treasure chest of flavors, including blackberry, spice, mocha and toasted oak. For all the richness, the wine is properly dry, and the tannins are as smooth as old silk. It's so approachable, it's hard to believe it's from Diamond Mountain, whose tannins are notoriously hard in youth. The one drawback is that the wine is too soft for aging, but who cares? Drink now–2015.
This gorgeous Sauvignon stands apart thanks to the creaminess and richness it offers in the mouth. That extra density is backed by bright aromas of peach, white flower, exotic fruit and dried sage.
Rounded peach, cider apple, chalk and seltzer aromas mix with a touch of yeast on the nose of this bottling. There's a racy, tactile acidity on the palate, lending depth to its dried apple, pear and sea salt flavors.
Possibly too much wood has been used in maturing this wine, which results in a toasty, burnt character to the otherwise ripe fruit. At four years, the wood should have mellowed.
An absolutely stunning selection, this opens with herbal tones of verbena, lime leaf and fynbos that sit atop a core of honeydew rind, apple and white peach. The medium-weight palate is sleek and smooth, but not flat, enlivened by bright acidity and a stony minerality. The just-ripe flavors of pear, citrus and melon carry through to the long finish. It's delicious now, but should age well through 2022.
This is gorgeous on the bouquet, with earth, flower blossom, licorice and sandalwood aromas. It feels lush and layered, with ripe, happy flavors of sultry black fruit and cassis. Fruity, long and delicious on the finish, this is a very easy Malbec to dig into now and until 2015.
Lush and opulent, this shows complex flavors of cherry compote, raspberry jam, date and exotic spice. Thoroughly dry on the finish, this drinks well right now. It offers a delicacy that's sometimes missing in Santa Lucia Pinot Noirs. From Hess Collection.
This elegant Brut Prosecco offers feminine aromas of jasmine and honeysuckle and completes the picture with a clean, tonic finish. Much of the success of this sparkler goes to the tight, sharp nature of the bubbling.
Rooty and sweet smelling, with tobacco, burnt brown sugar and raisin aromas. The palate is thick, stacked and jammy, with raisin, tobacco and candied prune and cherry flavors. Very tasty and sweet but a little flat and old.
The De Bortoli Pinots always seem to have a sense of restraint to them, and the 2007 Estate Grown is no different. What is special about this wine is the fine, silky nature of the tannins, which impart a lacy, delicate texture to the finish. Featured flavors include herb-tinged cherries and Asian spices.
Peach and apple aromas are soft and easy, maybe even a touch cidery. Overall, this is a standard but well-made Albariño, with flavors of nectarine and cider. Drink immediately.
Dry, wooly aromas of apple and peach pit are steady. Pithy nectarine and apple flavors veer towards citrus on a mild, focused finish.
Very youthful, so the first aromas are of a wild field, with some cranberry. It’s a full-volume wine, with an appealing chunky forwardness but also bright acidity, style and character. In a word, it’s “balanced.” Will go with almost anything, from baked salmon to dark chocolate. A real pleaser, especially at this price point. Best Buy.
Spicy tangerine peels perfume this intense, full-bodied Gewürztraminer. It's richly textured, almost creamy, in mouthfeel but balanced brightly in acidity. Hints of fennel and pollen pepper a pleasantly phenolic finish.
Hints of sweaty saddle leather, cherries and dark chocolate mark the nose and palate of this wine. This medium-bodied wine doesn't show much in the way of tannins, making it easy to drink now and probably best drunk up before 2020.
A new offering from this winery, this pulls no punches with its dense, concentrated flavors of raspberry jam, red apple, peppery spices and huckleberry. It offers a dazzling mouthfeel and an extended finish.
Unfortunately this wine just hangs on the cusp of quality. The nose is somewhat muddy and grassy. Plummy fruit with tangy acids carry the unrefined palate. Cola nut is noticeable on the dry finish. The effort seems to be there, but the result is not stellar.
This is a really good Pinot, dry and rich, and it shows the balance of power and racy delicacy that Green Valley Pinots, and particularly Iron Horse's, are known for. The cola, cherryskin, rhubarb and pomegranate flavors are quite complex, especially when they create all sorts of waves as they hit the oak.
This Cabernet is not providing much pleasure now. Bone dry and hard in tannins and acids, it's aloof to the point of unfriendly. But there are lots of blackberries packed inside. Give it at least 8 years in the cellar.
Like the Merlot, this is varietally correct, in this case balancing blackberry and white pepper flavors. Supple tannins make it go down smooth and easy, without a second thought.
The nose on this slightly cloudy wine is ruled by lemon-lime soda and chalky candy, which is interesting but one-dimensional. It's easy to drink and smooth enough, with a slight green apple skin tartness, but somewhat flat on the palate.
This is a real New Zealand-style Sauvignon Blanc. It's dry and tart, with rich gooseberry, lime, green apple, Asian pear, vanilla and white pepper flavors. A touch of oak brings a pleasant, buttery toastiness. The grapes come from the cool Arroyo Seco AVA and the warm San Lucas AVA, a brilliant blending decision that makes this wine especially balanced.
This is a popular and reliable wine to pair with desserts or to drink alone. It offers foamy mousse with peach and honey on the finish.
This vintage of Orma (a hearty blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc) shows loads of ripe fruit intensity backed by spice, toasted nut, chocolate, tobacco and leather. It's a chewy, rich wine that would taste perfect with steak or roast pork.
Aromas of citrus zest, stone fruit, toasted almond and a whiff of light baking spice lead the way on this polished white. The vibrant, elegantly structured palate shows Bosc pear, white peach, nectarine and a hint of ginger. A mineral note backs up the finish.
A simple, fresh white with citrus fruit, a touch of wood and some pineapple sweetness. It is rounded and herbaceous, ready to drink.
With subtle wood aging, this is a smooth wine that has hints of toast over its delicious white and apricot fruits. Orange zest tang gives a delicious bite and texture, suggesting how well the wine will age. Drink this fruity wine from 2017.
Ripe berry, raisin and Maduro cigar aromas are hefty and convincing for Spanish Syrah. This feels full, with bracing acidity. Flavors of cassis, plum, chocolate and tobacco are steady as a barge on calm water. This is impressive for varietal Syrah from Spain. Drink through 2021.
Perfectly salmon pink in color, this blend of half-Sangiovese, half-Barbera, is light and refreshing, with bright flavors of watermelon, cherry and mint. Just the tiniest bit ripe, yet finishing dry, it's long lasting and satisfying, a good call for a summer's day.
Il Borro's Polissena is a soft, elegant expression of Sangiovese with deep layers of ripe red fruit, blueberry, earthy tones and soft smoke. It shows a firm but polished tannic structure with a touch of licorice and dark cola.
92-94 Barrel sample. Smooth, the wood almost dominant but finally integrating well with the ripe yellow fruits. It is rich, creamy, with some toastiness, but well balanced.
Raspberry, leather and baked aromas are the entry to a lush palate that registers as soft and chunky. Baked, savory flavors of bacon, blackberry, mocha and earth finish smoky and with an echo of cured meat. This is warm but not hot or sticky.
As always, this gracious white wine made from the Viura grape delivers the goods. In this case, it's pineapple and pear aromas in front of pleasant apple and fresh celery flavors. There's even some honeyed apple to the finish. Light, liquidy and never bad when served properly chilled.
Soft and pliable in body, it has gentle citrus hints and crisp acidity.
86-88. Barrel sample. This wine is dominated by new wood, with caramel and sweet fruit flavors. It feels unbalanced, with the acidity way behind the fruit.
Seems slightly disjointed, with pungent diesel aromas on one hand and sweet-tart melon and pear flavors on the other. It's atypically broad in the mouth for Riesling, almost fat, yet closes on a tangy, earthy note. Imported by Schmitt-Sohne Inc.
Soft and fruity, this is a ripe style of rosé. It's dry and peppery, with fresh acidity cutting through its rounded texture. It's a rosé for food, with a full aftertaste.
This opens with floral aromas of violet and rose bud, followed by light berry and plum notes. The palate tastes easy and fresh.
One of the highest-rated Pays d'Oc wines in the history of Wine Enthusiast, this deep, dark rose-hued wine is lusciously fruity without being simple, combining cherries and peaches with scents of leather and earth. Round, supple and refreshing.
Enormously extracted fruit marks this wine. It's technically dry and wonderfully brisk in acidity, but so rich in raspberry jam, brown sugar and oak, it's remarkably lush in style.
Fresh juice aromas and caramelized blackberry scents combine with dark chocolate and a little lavender in this blend of 44% Petite Sirah, 38% Syrah, 10% Mourvèdre and 8% Grenache. Soft, thick and sticky on the palate, it shows tangy plum skin and tart boysenberry flavors, with sharp and strong acidity.
Yeasty aromas set the scene for a wine that is fresh, crisp and not long in bottle. It is an attractive Champagne, and its grapefruit and lime flavors are refreshing. Pre-dinner drinks would be a good moment for this wine. Imported by Grape Expectations of Georgia.
This ups the percentage of Cabernet to 60%, with 25% Syrah, 14% Petit Verdot and just 1% Cabernet Franc. Released almost a full year later than the other Long Shadows reds, it is well-integrated and focused, with high-toned black cherry fruit set in dusty tannins. Scents of sandalwood drift through, along with cocoa and spice. As good or even better than the outstanding 2006.
With a dark, old gold color and rich aromas of apricot honey, this wine promises to reward with opulence. But it doesn't live up to the advance billing. It's extraordinarily sweet, yet the citrus and apricot fruit is curiously thin and fleeting.
Superripe in blackberry, red plum, cherry, mocha, fig and caramel flavors, this wine certainly scores high on the deliciousness factor. It could use greater structural depth and complexity but is good overall.
Leesy stone-fruit aromas start out tight and crisp but lose clarity and cleanliness as this warms up in the glass. A lean, fresh palate holds flavors of barely ripe stone fruits and dried apricot that run long on a finish with bitter notes of grape skins.
Chiandrè has fresh and floral fragrances of violet and red berry. The palate shows marasca cherry and plum flavors alongside supple tannins and a spicy white pepper accent.
Aromas of stewed prune, tobacco, resin and menthol lead the noses. The full-bodied, one-dimensional palate is rather evolved, offering raisin and clove alongside close-grained but not very persistent tannins.

A bigger, richer wine than Te Awa Farm's Longlands Cabernet blend, this Merlot is packed with black-cherry and chocolate aromas and flavors. A supple texture makes this drinkable now, but some black-tea notes on the finish argue in favor of at least short-term cellaring. Try in 2003 if you can wait that long.
Tender notes of orange peel and pear skin reach the nose. The palate shows a vivid note of orange peel, with an herbal hint of mint and a wonderfully light, fluid touch. There is concentration but also poise, absolute dryness and wonderful length. There is an elegant touch that makes this all the more seductive, especially on the tingling zesty finish. A total joy. Drink 2017–2030.
Bin 389 is always a Cab-Shiraz, although the 2009 is only just, at 51% Cabernet and 49% Shiraz. This year's version is chocolaty and ripe, with plenty of weight and a slightly creamy feel. Cassis and vanilla notes fill out the palate, which finishes long, with an elegant texture akin to fine suede. Drink now–2025.
Wow. What a super Riesling at an everyday price. Shows a brilliant crispness and minerality that scours and cleanses the mouth, followed by savory citrus, green apple, spice, wildflower and honey flavors. But the finish is totally dry.
Aromas of French oak, toast and spiced blueberry lead the nose. Showing the challenges of the cool, wet vintage, this is leaner than previous years but still offers wild cherry, coffee bean and anise alongside bright acidity and polished if not very persistent tannins. All in all an impressive effort for 2014. Drink soon.
Underbrush, charred earth, ripe dark-skinned fruit, grilled herb and a whiff of cooking spice aromas all come together on this chewy red. The round palate doles out fleshy black cherry, cured meat, chopped herb and tobacco while a touch of star anise backs up the finish. Robust, velvety tannins support the juicy fruit. This will offer fine near-to-mid-term pleasure.
A haze of smoked nut and toasted cedar envelop ripe, fleshy black cherry and raspberry in this rich, but elegantly balanced, Spätburgunder. Crisp, tart cranberry and cassis notes brighten the midpalate easing into a finish marked b fine but slightly bitter tannins. Drinks well now but should meld nicely from 2020.
A little on the sweet, candied and soft side, with Lifesaver cherry and black raspberry flavors. But it's well balanced in acidity and is easy to drink.
Forward and pretty, with broad blackberry, black cherry and cassis fruit, this instantly accessible Cabernet Sauvignon offers many pleasures for an affordable price. Smooth tannins taste lightly of clean earth, coffee and light herb, giving just enough grip to offset the lightness of the fruit.
A fine wine from Septima, most likely with Malbec at its base (though the label says nothing of the sort). Aromas of blackberry, raspberry, perfume, pepper and asphalt are attractive, and the rooty richness and slight medicinality of the core flavors are unique but not out of focus. One of the winery's best wines to date.
A tart, leafy Pinot, with brambly berry, tomato leaf and light cola flavors. Light and tannic, with some earthy weight to the midpalate.
Musky, with aromas of lemon-lime, tonic water, and bubble gum. Downright spritzy in the mouth, where it almost seems to bubble up and impersonate a bottle of Sprite soda. Lacks sophistication, but pours on the citrus and green melon. Imported by Morandell Imports.
Another fine vintage for Trust Riesling, with a pretty, lilting cadence that weaves the sweet/tart fruits into scents of melon, citrus and orange peel. Flavors follow, with a strong impression of English breakfast tea.
Typical varietal aromas of lychee, citrus and white flowers feed into a juicy palate that's tight and tangy in feel. Lychee, pineapple and mango flavors hold form on the finish before showing a slight bit of pith and bitterness at the end. Drink now.
This sophisticated red offers aromas of mocha, smoke and cinnamon spice, and flavors of blackberry, pepper and smoke in a smooth, rich package. Complex and unfolding, with ripe tannins and a lingering finish. Pair with lamb, beef or game.
A blend of 55% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot, 15% Malbec and 10% Petit Verdot, this reflects a pleasing mixture of each, with notes of blackberry, raspberry, plum and fresh herbs. Fruit flavors are plush and up front backed by chewy tannins.
The purple flowers and pomegranate fruits that hit the nose first on this bottling give way quickly to savory elements of rosemary and roasted fennel. That savoriness carries to the palate, as does an earthy character, lifted by pine and juniper-berry spice.
There is a toughness to this young wine that will take time to soften. On the other hand, there is plenty going for it with the smoky black fruits and acidity and the warm aftertaste. Drink from 2019.
Produced from two parcels totaling 2.8 acres, this is a properly powerful wine. It has a concentrated texture and firm tannins. They are balanced with the black fruits and strongly mineral texture of this impressive wine. Like any wine of this quality, this needs to age for a considerable period. Drink from 2024.
This simple wine is full of fruit. There is no wood aging here, just ripe pear and apricot flavors that are gently textured. The wine, with its crisp final acidity, is ready to drink.
Big, ripe, voluptuous and mouth-filling are just a few of the descriptors that come to mind with this dry, juicy Zin. It's a rollicking romp through a fruit store, with a raisiny finish, and feels hotter than the 14.4% alcohol the label says it has.
This wine's tropical fruit and fragrant white flower scents lift out of the glass while the lively palate doles out juicy white peach, green apple and grapefruit flavors. It has clean, crisp finish.
Vincenzo Toffoli's Exra Dry Prosecco (a style that is slightly sweeter than Brut) delivers thick, frothy effervescence with aromatic highlights that include passion fruit, mango and creamy lemon-lime.
The acidity is in the forefront, with little structure or fruit to fill it out. The fruit displays notes of milk chocolate, red plum and fresh herbs. The toast and oakspice ride nicely on the clean finish.
Made from a blend of 65% Pinot Bianco, 25% Friulano, 10% Riesling Renano and aged in barriques, this opens with aromas of oak, toast and lemon zest. These carry over to the palate along with vanilla, apple and butterscotch. The hefty presence of alcohol throws this wine off balance.
Viognier remains a strong suit for William Church, and part of the consistency is the vineyard sourcing each vintage from Conner Lee and Gamache, in roughly equal proportions. Lemon and lime, peaches and apricots rule the palate, ripe but neither hot nor bitter. There's a good long finish as well, but it's the fruit that really shines.
Sweet and forward in pineapple, peach and lime flavors, this is a blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay. It has good acidity and a clean, spicy finish.
This is a plump, medium-bodied rosé at a reasonable price. Pomelo or grapefruit notes combine with stone fruit, then finish stony-dry and tart.
Not a success, with sweet-and-sour flavors. There's a vinegary edge to the sugared pineapples and tangerines.
Delicate spring flower and orchard fruit scents lift out of the glass. On the crisp palate, a bitter almond note underscores yellow peach, golden apple and nectarine flavors, with lively acidity.
Brooding flavors of dark cherry and pure cocoa initially play on the palate, but it slowly opens up to reveal a deceptive lightness. The body is sleek yet concentrated, with super-soft tannins. With haunting edges of cherries preserved in kirsch and bitter chocolate, this is an intriguing, elegant wine that's lovely now but will also age gracefully through 2019.
Already showing signs of the kerosene aromas that comes from aging Riesling, this is a tangy, aromatic and not quite dry wine with white peach flavors and a zesty aftertaste. Drink now.
The vineyard is in the Santa Maria Valley, and has been source for many years of great Pinots for multiple wineries lucky enough to obtain its fruit. The wines always show a similar profile of tannins, brisk acidity, a certain full-bodiedness and plenty of crushed brown spices. In this cool '11 vintage, the wine is particularly tart in cranberries and raspberries. Decant for a few hours before drinking.
A dull, unformed nose gives way to sweet dried prune notes in this highly ripe, earthy wine.
Smells funky and tanky, and has a heavy, thick texture with blackberry flavors.
Better than jug wine even if it comes in a big bottle, with clean, lightly expressive cherry, raspberry and plum flavors. There's a little heat and roughness to the finish, but given the league that it's playing in you can't complain about the overall quality of this Mendoza Cabernet. A big-time barbecue or party wine.
Black Label Gavi from the historic La Scolca winery offers zesty freshness backed by crisp aromas of grapefruit and crushed white mineral. The boasts beautiful, clean simplicity.
Vines over 50-years-old give a concentrated cru wine. It is ripe with berry fruits topped by spice. Fruity and likely to develop quickly, it is an attractive wine to drink young from mid-2017.
This chocolatey sexy wine tastes of cherries and sandalwood, with a strong dark chocolate note. A hint of pine needles comes out in the bouquet, and although it's already drinking well, it will surely improve with a few more years of bottle age.
Toasted notes of almond and spice give this expression of Cabernet Sauvignon momentum and density. Blackberry, moist earth and tobacco aromas make up the generous bouquet.
A ripe, sweet, soft style of Chardonnay that pours on the banana and pear aromas and flavors. The feel runs toward the valley, and the finish is all vanilla and sweet, melony fruit. Good enough but not all that lively.

Heavy on the nose, this wine's prune-like aromas lead to a medium-bodied quaff with good, smooth tannins and heavy prune flavors. Finishes solid, although on the tangy side.
Spicy aromas of balsam wood, tobacco and sawmill work well with ripe but reserved red-berry scents. Tight, tannic but also fresh as opposed to drying, this Cabernet from a cool year delivers a classic set of herbal berry, plum and wood spice flavors. A ripped finish is dry and oaky now, with core fruit resting for the future. Drink 2018–2028.
In this rare varietal for California, a buttery, almost earthy aroma leads to restrained butterscotch and melon flavors and a creamy texture, while the balance is still dry. Medium bodied, it has enough weight to keep buttery and nutty nuances going on the finish.
With its fragrance of wild flowers and red berries, this wine is as attractive as its unique, square-based bottle that allows for more contact between the yeasts and wine during secondary fermentation. Made with Pinot Noir, the crisp, savory palate boasts crushed raspberries, mineral and baking spices alongside a silky mousse. Extremely elegant.
Fruity and ripe, this has rich red fruits and a smooth texture, with blended acidity. Its concentrated, with a piquant edge of pepper from the alcohol.
This wine seems quite reduced out of the gate, delivering aromas that prove distracting. The palate shows more depth with an array of pleasing dark fruit flavors.
This is dry, earthy and complex on the nose, with smooth tannins, elegance and acidic lift to the palate. Flavors of fine oak, copious spice and complex berry are more than satisfying, while the finish is long, dry and composed, featuring a note of cinnamon.
A tough sell at this price. The nose is minty, green and smells of tobacco, spice and fern fronds, while the palate is tangy, clangy in feel and dry. Flavors of semisour, herbal cherry and plum are touched up by sweet oak, but overall it's rather dry and scouring.
A bit unrefined, with candied pear, apricot jam and oak flavors and a soft texture. Feels heavy, instead of lively.
A solid and concentrated wine. it promises much for the future. For now, the red fruits come with a stalky structure and high acidity. These will integrate well, to grow into a wine that is rich and firmly structured. Drink from 2015.

Rubbery, spicy berry fruit aromas carry a note of salinity. The wine is boldly structured, with hard tannins. Roast plum, blackberry and spice flavors lean toward syrupy, while a generous finish delivers ending power.
A touch of volatility accompanies opening black fruit and plum aromas, while the palate brings both a raisiny essence and austere acidity that causes tartness. For basic Priorat, this is fine. But if you're looking for greatness, there isn't much to speak of. Overall, it's a good but regular wine, nothing more or less.

Dr. Loosen's Kabinett wines sometimes approach the Spätlese level of concentration and flavor; this Spätlese could be someone's Auslese. It's decadently ripe, a rich mouthful of peaches, apricots, orange and pineapple, almost viscous and floral-honey sweet. Which is not to say it lacks acidity, structure or balance. Wonderful, spicy-sweet cinnamon and nutmeg accents offset the fruit, there's a somewhat grainy palate texture, like ultraripe pears. Finishes long.
The vineyard is on typical steep slopes on the north bank of the Douro River with cooler corners for white wine. This wood-aged wine is in a bottle more suited to a liqueur and is impressively rich while preserving its cool feel.

It's rare to see a vineyard-designated bottle of Pinot Gris from the state. This one brings light aromas of apple and pear that are followed by dry fleshy fruit flavors. It hits all the right notes.
Good value in an everyday Merlot. Smooth and plush in texture, the ripe flavors include cherries, blackberries, mocha, dried herbs and peppery spices, with a touch of toasty oak.
A bit simple, but definitely not shy on flavor, bursting with melon and pear fruit. It's an attempt at an Alsatian style, full and weighty in the mouth, and showing a trace of heat on the finish.
Zinfandel from old vines is rarely this light and refreshing, yet still exuberant in fruit.

More Sangiovese (62%) is in the blend this year, with Cabernet and Syrah filling out the rest. It's dark and smoky, featuring an intriguing flavor mix of spun sugar and black cherry. It seems to hit a firm wall of toast and char that rounds out with some hours of breathing time. Certainly one of the best Saggi offerings to date.
Aged in 60% new French oak and made with a good dose of malolactic fermentation, this Chardonnay is dominated buttered toast and popcorn flavors. It's an opulent style of Chardonnay, but obscures pleasant flavors of tropical fruit, pear and apricot.

A very interesting example of Carneros that should improve for 5–6 years, if not longer.
Lime, tarragon and fresh green aromas are a bit minerally and stony in front of a linear, pure palate. Flavors of lemon-lime, peach and nectarine are just right, moderately minerally and fade away with clarity and style. Drink right away.
The medium-intense aromas of honeyed nut, glazed pineapple and papaya are rich and exotic. Medium to full bodied, the palate bears snappy acidity that keeps the wine feeling vibrant. A slight papaya-seed-like bitterness creates some tension, which lingers on the finish.
Ross Mickel (Ross Andrew Winery) made this Côtes du Rhône-style blend, a flashy riot of floral scents and earthy, funky fruit. Even with several hours breathing time it feels tight—decanting is mandatory. But give it a few years in the cellar and it will unpack even more layers of flavor. Dry and astringent in the mouth, it brings young flavors of cranberry juice and grape concentrate, plenty of acidity and minerality, and excellent depth.
The alcohol is nearly 15% and there is some burn in the mouth, along with high-toned flavors bordering on volatile. Sharp and penetrating, it seems to have blown past most of its fruit.
A bit tan and dull to the eye, with neutral aromas of apple cider and peach. The palate is wet, uncomplicated and simple, with basic apple flavors that some might consider to be bland. Solid on the finish, with papaya for flavor.

This expression of Morellino di Scansano opens with bright, cheery aromas of red berry, blueberry and sweet almond paste. More almond and bitter spice nuances appear on the close.
Impressive for sheer mass and the enormity of its fruits and spices, which makes it taste almost like fruitcake or a dry Port. Lavishly oaked, but the fruit and underlying structure of acids and tannins can handle it, resulting in a harmony and grace rare in a wine of this size. The finish goes on and on.
The lively spice notes on the nose of this zippy, easy and fresh Grüner fully do justice to the variety's nickname 'Pfefferl', meaning little peppery one. The palate is light and brimming with citrus-scented crispness. Drink soon—preferably on a languorous hot afternoon.
Made with 90% Schiava and 10% Lagrein, this approachable wine conveys subdued aromas of red berry and underbrush. The palate offers crushed strawberry, sour cherry plus hints of tangerine and almond. Soft tannins and bright acidity provide the framework.
A difficult wine to praise. It's tough in tannins, with green, stalky flavors and quite a bit of vegetal unripeness. It's drinkable at a big party.

The flagship of the Clarendon Hills line, this comes from a patch of 80-year-old vines that winemaker Bratasiuk claims routinely provides his best fruit.

It's dense and amply textured in the mouth, packed with wonderfully expressive blackberry and blueberry fruit, then shows layers of rich tannins on the finish that leave no doubt this needs time in the cellar to show its best. This is a tour de force of Australian winemaking that should be consumed 2010–2025.
All Milbrandt fruit has created a sappy, buttery and bright Washington Chardonnay. It bursts upon the palate with a beautiful mix of tropical fruits and caramel. Flavors are rich, persistent and lush. You want more long after the bottle has been drained.
91-93 Barrel sample. A big, friendly, ripe wine, opulent and generous. There is a lovely sweetness here, with a full bodied structure. Big and bold.
Made from fruit grown in several notable Napa vineyards, this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon has impressive weight and depth. Its black currant, dark chocolate, anise, pepper and toasted cedar flavors sink deep into the mouth with sweet insistence. The tannins are considerable and will enable this wine to age over the next 10 years. Pair this with rich meats and cheeses.

From Gundagai, an area southwest of Sydney. A linear, fine quaff, full of black cherry and plum fruit. Its cottony-tannic shell has more staying power than its stuffing. Finishes with more black cherry fruit. Imported by South Pacific Wines.

Tight and tannic, this majority Cab wine is distinguished by a thickness of black fruit and herbaceous back palate that gives it density, separated by bursts of vanilla and oak. Give it time to open and notes of mocha chocolate should also come through.

This is the winery's reserve, made just twice previously, in 2010 and 2012. Production is up sharply, and it's a ripe, round fruit pie of a wine, best enjoyed while still young. Red fruits and citrus are in the mix, with a touch of papaya. It was aged 14 months in French oak, two-thirds of it new.
Big and forward but still elegant, which is what we like. Spice and bold black fruit carry the bouquet, which leads straight to a smooth palate flush with berry, plum and cola flavors.

This is a wine that's soft in structure, and while it's dry, it's hard in tannins and the fruit has a baked taste like shrivelled raisins. Not an ager.
Simple and jammy, with sharp flavors of raspberries, cherries, gingersnap cookies and spices. Tasty and sweet, but lacking the structure to contain all that richness.
A bit on the sweet, simple side, with flavors like a supermarket carton of pineapple, apple, pear and mango juices. Oak adds even sweeter notes of vanilla. Lacks complexity, especially at this price.
Generous tannins surround a core of ripe, brawny blackberry fruit and a powerful imprint of dried herb in this wine, which is rich and concentrated. Earthy tobacco and chocolate seal the finish.
Older vines from the named vineyard provide the fruit for this 100% Sangiovese, barrique-aged Super Tuscan. The cherry, tart-berry and chocolate aromas pick up vibrant licorice accents as they blossom into full flavors on the palate.

Though the vines are young, the wine shows immense promise.
A light touch is put on this elegant wine, one that successfully captures the wild ethereal nature of the appellation. Crushed rock is evoked on the palate, around fully developed flavors of fig, cigar, clove and dried herb. Tannic, the body softens on the midpalate.
Somewhat brittle and nervous in the mouth, with lots of tart acidity. The flavors are brilliant, suggesting ripe cranberries, cherries and cola, with a fascinating edge of mushrooms and leather. All indications are that the wine needs time in the bottle to mellow. Drink after 2013.
This has been one of the best, most consistent bottlings of Chenin Blanc in California, and Ballentine deserves credit for sticking with it. The wine is a fine alternative to Sauvignon Blanc, dry, crisply acidic, and rich in citrus, spearmint, pepper and Asian pear flavors.
Spicy and inviting on the nose, with no shortage of oak. The palate holds that spiciness as bramble and some tartness enter the fray. More of a ready-to-go food wine; it doesn't really have the depth or complexity to go further.
Concentrated honey aromas decorate grilled white peach and scratched tangerine-skin aromas on this wine from one of the region's most historically Rhône-focused vineyards.

All the secrets of this wine are still locked away—only time will reveal them. There are glimpses of lemon and grapefruit and notions of yeast on a thrillingly pure, streamlined and linear palate. Right now there is fruit, with time there will be eternal stone. This is Riesling with true pedigree. There is a lesson, too: You can impress with Federspiel, it does not always have to be Smaragd! Drink now until 2030.
Coming from the winery's SJR Vineyard in The Rocks District, this blockbuster wine displays savory aromas of green olive, sea breeze, smoked meat, peat and earth along with coffee and plum.

The aromas are light, with notes of freshly cut apple and spice. It drinks dry with elegantly styled fruit flavors that linger on the finish. It shows a very pretty styling.
Perhaps the last Washington wine of the vintage to be released, this is beginning to enter mid-life. For those who want a hint of how well Washington reds can age, this is a perfect introduction. Drinking beautifully at the moment, though definitely ageworthy still, it shows a soft mix of medium-ripe red fruits, chocolate, herb, earth and barrel. The finish is like soft leather, with a final impression of milk chocolate. Very seductive.

This brilliant and affordable wine will be amazingly versatile with food, as it shows wonderful ripe black-cherry aromas, equally fruity flavors, and a fresh, almost crisp, texture that's unusual for a red wine. It has good concentration, too, and enough depth to stay interesting.
Ripe, dense blackberry aromas are capped by creamy, toasty, chocolaty oak. In the mouth, this touches up against syrupy and cloying. Toasty oak, graphite, vanilla and milk chocolate flavors accent core blackberry, while heat and a chocolaty oak flavor drive the finish. Drink through 2020.
Stretched and woody on the nose, with not much fruit. It feels wide, grabby and tannic, with leathery, herbal berry flavors. Grabby on the finish, this is still quite tannic and a bit tough on the palate.
Mount Veeder Cabernets usually have tough tannins, making the Cabernets ageworthy, but this 100% varietal bottling neither requires cellaring nor will reward it. Enjoy the tight astringency now for its upfront blackberry, black currant and cassis flavors.

Ripe and juicy in currant and chocolate flavors, with a good backbone of tannins and acids. Turns a bit raw on the finish, but will be nice now with rich meats.
This Sauvignon is tuned down in terms of its aromatics and not very intense overall. You will encounter measured notes of acacia flower, honey and exotic fruit and the wine is fresh and informal in delivery.

Aromas of white peach and honeysuckle yield to flavors of grapefruit, peach, jasmine and orange blossom. This wine is smooth in the mouth and the zesty finish is characterized by lingering floral flavors.

Pretty aromatic layers of mint, cola, almond paste, blueberry and currant mark this wine. The mouthfeel is silky and clean, and there's a bright note of acidity on the finish.
91-93. Barrel sample. With a dominant austere minerality, this wine has weight but not the delicious fruitiness of the vintage. The finish is marked by a steely texture.
This wine delivers fruit, fruit and more fruit, at a deliciously affordable price. Bold black-cherry aromas and flavors feature just a tinge of spice, then fade away quickly on the faintly dusty finish. Drink now.
Tedeschi makes a fine Recioto with firm tannins and generous aromas of black fruit, spice, cinnamon and prune. It tastes smooth and silky and offers a curious balance between natural sweetness and dense structure.

Villa Maria's single-vineyard wines are usuallly incredibly expressive, and this flashy Chardonnay from Hawke's Bay is no exception.

Delicious now, so there's no need to defer gratification.
With its flavors of baked fruit and mushroom, this wine already tastes old and tired.
This dry wine from the Ribbon Ridge vineyard, adjacent to the winery, is briskly tart without being sour. Flavors of lemony tea and Meyer lemon meringue intrigue immediately.

Portal's 2004 vintage is a powerful effort from an average year. The dark structures are all here: the rich, sweet fruit is dense and concentrated, flavored with currants and black figs. This should age well, with its present dominant dry structure.
An awkward wine, with apricot and grapefruit flavors that finish bone dry and tart. Loses points for sourness.
A strongly flavored Pinot, this has plenty of saturated cherry-jam fruit. Tart acidity and some chili pepper heat from the alcohol contribute to the mouthfeel, while oak brings a toast note. This is likely to be best over the next few years.

Delicate in tannins, it's approachable already but should drink well through 2025.
A full-bodied, slightly heavy style with a thick texture. Smells like warm baked apples, complete with cinnamon and clove accents; tastes similar, picking up some oily-diesely nuances. Despite the heft, finishes a bit short.
A particularly fresh and refreshing wine, with the cleanest acidity, attractive red fruits and grapefruit juice. A great apéritif style. Screwcap.
This wine comes from an 8.6-acre parcel of old vines above Jolivet's home village of Bué. It is mineral and tight, with concentration and intensity. The herbal character on this very young wine will soften into the fine fruitiness that is there. It needs to age a bit more, so drink from 2017.

With its tropical fruit aromas, this is a superripe wine. The fruits are dominant— rounded mango and yellow peach with an attractive touch of essential citrus acidity. It's ready to drink but will age over 3–4 years.
This wine has been in release for almost two years, but the extra time has only improved it. Nicely melding the strengths of Klipsun vineyard Cabernet and Merlot with 24 months in half new, half year-old French oak barrels, this powerful wine has concentrated cherry and cassis fruit, potent baking spices, suggestions of mint and pepper, and a host of details waiting to be noticed. A great bottle to toss into a blind tasting of high-end California reds.

The vintage brings out the tension of this magisterial Chardonnay, and it layers nervy acidity with fresh apple and peach flavors and intense minerality. It is poised and ready to develop over many years.
Metaphorically speaking, Chapoutier has put this wine right down the center of the fairway. An orange blossom aroma marks the nose, while melon and tangerine flavors take over on the palate. It's all remarkably balanced and pure, remaining long and refreshing on the palate. Try it as an apéritif.
A little sweet, a little scoury, but at this price,a good bargain. It's a refreshingly clean, crisp bubbly with raspberry, lime and sourdough flavors. The blend is Pinot Noir, Gamay, Sangiovese and Zinfandel.

Subtle notes of white grapefruit and struck flint intensify on the palate of this off-dry wine. Fresh tangerine sweetness is subtle and integrated, offset by nervy acidity and a cool, steely finish.
Plummy and dark, with accents of cedar, dark chocolate and hints of coffee. This is always the most robust of the Felton Road Pinots, and really deserves a few years in the cellar; although it's approachable now, expect the already soft tannins to turn silkier in time.
Clearly in the mineral camp, with aromas of wet stones and gravel taking precedence over the peach fruit. Some nice lanolin and kiwi flavors peek through in the mouth, set against a soft, light-bodied structure. The mineral finish is on the short side. Drink now.
This has a classic Nebbiolo nose of new leather, rose petal, red berry, tilled earth and a whiff of aniseed. On the palate, toast, white pepper and a hint of oak-driven spice back up a core of sour cherry. It's still tightly wound and needs a few more years to come together. Drink 2018–2025.
Scents of white spring flower and orchard fruit lead the nose on this lively white. The fresh, easy-drinking palate offers ripe green apple, peach and a juicy citrus note alongside tangy acidity.

Imported by Maisons Marques & Domaines USA.

This full-bodied, dry and quite tannic wine follows the classic form of California Cabernet Sauvignon, which forms 65% of the blend. The aroma is full of ripe black fruit shaded by nutmeg, cedar and cinnamon, while black currant and dark chocolate drive the concentrated and deeply rooted flavors. Best after 2020.
Although 2008 was not a general vintage, some estates have released vintage Ports. Noval's Vintage, just bottled at the time of tasting, is a delicate and perfumed wine, elegant rather than powerful, with delicious black berry fruits to go with the rich core of sweet tannins.
Rich in strawberry, raspberry, vanilla and brown sugar flavors, this 100% Pinot Noir is delicate in texture, with brisk acidity. It's a good bubbly for drinking now.
Toast, lemon peel, apple and butter are the opening aromas, and they are followed by solid but pedestrian peach, apricot, melon and pear flavors. Big in the mouth, with modest acidity. Thus, while it's holding firm now, our advice is to get at it soon.
A 24-acre vineyard at the southern end of the Graves region has produced a 2010 that is rich while still retaining an attractive light touch. There are firm tannins that are the background to the blackberry fruits and bold structure. Drink this wine from 2017.
Don't be confused by the Côtes du Rhône appellation—this is 100% Syrah from the northern Rhône. So while it shows black cherry and cassis fruit and hints of cracked pepper, it remains medium-bodied, with a dustiness to the finish.
Lively, fruity and well made, this wine has plenty of raspberry and cherry flavors, good acidity and light tannins to add a bit of grip to the texture. For a medium-bodied wine, it has nice concentration.
Aromas of raspberry, thyme and sage are the lead-in to flavors of black cherry, cassis, cranberry, smoked meat and violet. Tannins are slightly stiff, but that is more than made up for by a constant sense of zippy acidity that carries on right into a bright and lingering finish.
Five different grape varieties go into this blend, including a surprising 8% Pinot Noir. There's a touch of grilled tomato upfront, followed by more traditional flavors of cassis, vanilla and chocolate. This medium- to full-bodied wine is open knit and ready to drink now.
Big and fruity, this has generous tannins and ripe black fruits. With its full fruits bursting out of the glass, it is already suitable for drinking. Delicious, full bodied and a great testament to the vintage's quality.
This earthy wine has barnyard aromas and a rough edge. The redeeming feature is the juicy black-currant fruit that provides a crisp aftertaste.
No doubt trying to capitalize on the red blend trend, this comes across as well made, but a bit confected. Black cherry fruit is clean but simple, with a round, soft mouthfeel.
Tan in color and bland as a whole, with vanilla and pear aromas that do little to allure or entice. Strained and pickled tasting, with a heavy, overdone overall style. Pushes the definition of “acceptable.”
Styring also makes a wine called Reckless, so you get a sense of where this unusual blend is coming from. Big cherry fruit is adorned with notes of citrus and pine needle, and one senses that the addition of 10% Petit Verdot has stiffened up the finish. If you had to describe it, it's Pinot Noir on steroids, with all that implies.
This is a good price for this New Zealand-style wine. It's dry and crisp in gooseberry, lime and fig flavors, and bursts with cinnamon and white pepper spice on the finish.
At this time, the heavy aromas of smoky wood and charred popcorn kernel subjugate the fruit. The palate feels open knit, almost flat, and it bears a blackberry flavor and more oak influence. A tangy taste of iron adds interest to the finish.
Widely available, this easy Prosecco offers fresh aromas of citrus, stone fruit and honey. It's elegantly packaged with a light blue label that would look gorgeous at a lunchtime table set by the pool.
Oaked up at all points, but still a good basic blend of two friendly grapes. Shows cherry and raspberry aromas along with graphite and barrel spice on the bouquet. The palate is edgy and resiny, with oak-infused raspberry, plum and citrus flavors. Lively and fresh, but the wood is pushy.
Muddled and chunky, with raspberry and leather on the nose. Not entirely fresh or forward; instead it sits on the palate in bland, heavy fashion. Shows pepper and red fruit flavors, but not much texture or variety. Imported by Walca International.
This medium-bodied white is a bit prickly and tough to like, with citrus pith aromas and largely neutral flavors that turn chalky and peppery on the finish.

The tannins are fine and there is statuesque poise of a very well-cut wine, like an Italian-tailored suit, elegant yet masculine. This drinks well already but will be even better in two to three years' time; drink through 2018.
Brander's first Sauvignon Blanc of the cool 2011 vintage is delicious: It tastes dryish to slightly off-dry, with excellent acidity brightening the citrus and tropical fruit flavors.

There's a forward hickory-maple smoke note to this interesting blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot and 20% Barbera. Dark berries, vanilla bean and toasted oak notes unfold on the nose and in the mouth, with a touch of cigar tobacco spice that carries through on the finish. Drink through 2016.
Fragrant aromas of mortared herbs, violets and red fruit lead to velvety soft red and blue-fruit flavors. It's a very pretty wine that shows a fine sense of precision.
This bright Barbaresco delivers an austere, traditional style with small berry nuances backed by ethereal tones of cola, licorice and tar. The thin, compact nature of the mouthfeel gives rise to a touch of alcoholic heat on the close.

Full-bodied and swathed in oak, this shows the bigger side of Chardonnay, piquant and luxe with lemon and grapefruit swirls within larger casings of vanilla and caramelized oak.
Superb at every checkpoint, this is a world-class wine. Cherry, cassis and earth aromas are spicy and mellow, not bullish or loud. This feels creamy but with enough textural grit to keep things lively, while flavors of vanilla, tobacco and plum are nicely integrated. A mild, medium-long finish epitomizes elegance. Drink now through 2025.

Imported by Mark Anthony Wine Merchants.
Borderline exotic on the nose, with aromas of black cherry, violet and a touch of earthy leather. The palate has some prickle and snap to it, but it settles into lively black plum and boysenberry. Finishes smooth, ripe and big, with medium length. The coupage is 80% Syrah and 20% Monastrell.

Sicilian Pinot Nero shows much of the variety's natural aromas of blue flower and wild berry, only in a thicker, more concentrated context. The southern Italian sun has done its part to produce a round, broad mouthfeel.
Give credit to the winery for making this creative blend of Syrah, Tempranillo, Malbec and Petit Verdot. Unfortunately, the end result is overripe and raisiny-pruny, which emphasizes the dry tannins, making them harsh.

This offbeat blend of Clarksburg-grown Chenin Blanc, Stolpman Vineyard Roussanne from Santa Ynez Valley, and Central Coast Viognier is remarkable. As you might expect, it's floral and fruity, but dry, with very high acidity and a modest 13.5% alcohol. It's a clean, food-friendly wine with a great degree of complexity.
This starts out well, with some varietal fruit and pepper in the nose. But the aggressive vanilla and coffee flavors suggest that the oak treatments were not well integrated, and the tannins have a bitterly harsh edge to them.

Definitely on the ripely sweet side, but nicely crisp in acids, this cocktail-style wine has rich and juicy flavors of pineapples, pears, figs, apples and dusty spices.
There aren't many Argentine Sauvignon Blancs that make a statement, so this is commendable for showing a lightly citric and minerally nose in front of fresh, citrusy flavors of lime, tangerine and grapefruit. More friendly and easygoing than intense or pungent, it fades quick and easy on the finish.
This is a thickly extracted Amarone with a black, inky appearance and powerful aromas of black fruit, exotic spice, bresaola, mesquite wood and cola. It's almost too much of a good thing and the palate becomes overwhelmed by the wine's muscle, power and overall sweetness.

This is not a crisp, lean, clear fino. It has a yellowing color and rather uncommon minty, nutty aromas. Some light fruit flavors run the show, while blanched almond, green olive and saline offer support. The finish is long, but maybe a bit sour and hot for some palates. Still, it's quite interesting and well made, and probably a good match with the right food.
This holds two-thirds Cabernet Sauvignon with the rest Merlot and a splash of Petit Verdot. Oak aromas of butterscotch, woodspice and vanilla are out in front of cherry and herbs. On the palate, the oak flavors lead, followed by coffee and cherry. It seems a bit heavy-handed right now but may come together with time.
An underlying smoky oak impression complements the succulently ripe, soft blue fruit in this medium-bodied wine. The finish is powerfully rich.
Made with 85% Sangiovese, 10% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Merlot, this shows subdued aromas of dark berry and cooking spice. The straightforward palate doles out crushed plum and clove alongside assertive tannins.
A nice, full-bodied Cabernet with some fancy features. It's a bit tight and tannic now, with the ripe blackberry fruit unintegrated with the 40% new oak, but a few hours of decanting should help. Contains all five Bordeaux varieties, which adds complexity.

Only lightly wood aged, this is a fruity wine with a touch of spice, some peaches and fragrant acidity. It is delicious wine and ready to drink.
This blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Sauvignon Gris is all barrel-fermented—the trick is that only 30% of the barrels are wood, the rest are stainless steel.

Subtle toasted nut and vanilla shadings frame melon and peach fruit, while the mouthfeel is creamy and rich, balanced by a bit of grapefruity tang on the finish.
Dry and crisp, this is a delicious rosé that has both ripe fruit and a tight line of acidity. Its red fruits are laced with fresh citrus character and an underlying touch of toast. This is a bottling that can improve with age, but is great now.
Darkly colored and flavored, this Merlot shows lots of toasty oak wrapped around a core of berry and black plum flavors. The mouthfeel is even and smooth, but the spicy finish turns a bit woody, picking up a dry, tart edge as the oak takes over. Tastes rather like a Cabernet, with its dark hue and flavor range.

Firm, tense and structured, this has weight and richness, with notes of quince and green plums, lending ripeness and acidity.

Still a sure-fire Best Buy in these days of inflation, yet in its own right this is pretty good Merlot. It's full-bodied and hints at smoked meat, leather and black fruit. The nose is solid and so is the palate. With no promises of miracles, it'll get the job done.
A fresh-faced rosé, with a rose-grey color, this has red fruit acidity and an attractive, creamy character to go with the crisp finish.

On the lean side, with green, herbal notes that impart a tough edge to the cherry flavors.

A rare misstep from Albrecht, the 2001 Gewürztraminer SGN seems a touch oxidized and nutty, with a broad, dull texture and a hint of butter on the finish. It's ripe and sweet, but it just doesn't seem quite right.
Some fruit comes from the Canali family's original 17-acre Trentino vineyard that was first planted in 1893, while the rest is sourced from other vineyards in the region. The result is a wine rich in honey, vanilla, banana, acacia and almond. Imported by E & J Gallo.
Animated and intensely likable, with exotic scents of Chinese spices and tropical limes floating over a mineral undertow. There's some intensity to the lemon-lime flavors on the palate, but they dissipate quickly on the crisp, short finish. Drink up.
Reserve is an unregulated term, so it is unclear what this means at Silvan Ridge. This is a thin, herbal and noticeably earthy wine. There is little in the way of fruit or varietal specificity. But it's perfectly quaffable.
Apple-cider and earth aromas open to a simple apple-toast palate. The mouthfeel is even, the finish dry and rather woody. Then again, there are few drinkable California Chardonnays of this age.

Elegance is the key word here, with the fruit flavors restrained but ever-so-classy. The acidity and the earthy edge of the rhubarb and red berries are held together by the roundness of the generous fruits. A classic from a warm year. Drink in 4–5 years.
An attractively light wine, showing its cool climate origin, with red currant fruit and juicy acidity. It's a great summer red, maybe even slightly chilled.

Aged in neutral oak and blended with 15% Cabernet Franc, this is a high-toned wine with sharp, vinegary acids, but not much character. Tannins are chewy and mask the fruit.

Delicate aromas of hazelnut, lemon zest and a whiff of subtle mineral carry over to the fresh palate. It's simple but well-made and would pair nicely with lightly seasoned vegetable risotto.
A gorgeous nose of blackberry, cedar, and cinnamon opens seamlessly into the robust yet elegant palate. Rich cassis, licorice, and cinnamon-toast flavors abound and the mouthfeel is suave. The tangy finish shows dusty tannins, big chocolate and black-cherry flavors. Well structured, it needs three to five years; should age well.
This wine shows power and ripeness on the palate, with an oaky nuttiness on the nose. Lemony pear and stony minerality combine with a graham cracker creaminess, providing weight and length.
Quite dark in the glass, this bottling from a vineyard often known for subtlety packs in a ton of power and darkness, starting with hefty blackberry, tree bark and sarsaparilla on the nose. Tart black-plum-skin flavors kick off the big palate, which grabs attention but is a little clumsy at this stage of life. Patience may bring cohesion.
Tropical aromas of lychee and pineapple come with blocky, pithy citrus notes. The palate follows that lead with body weight and power; flavors of green fruits fold in a touch of nettle and funk, while the finish is medium in length but doesn't bring anything new to the table.
A deep raspberry flavor is set in a vivid frame of spicy herb and toasty barrel accents. The finish is crisply defined, with slightly peppery tannins.

Soft and round, this 100% varietal wine made from two clones is juicy and fresh in acidity, a sense of restraint allowing it to sconvey more than just fruit. Cassis, black pepper, cedar and a slight streak of menthol combine nicely on the palate, intertwining on the lengthy finish.

This is jammy, ripe and raisiny smelling, then round, full, slightly choppy and tannic on the palate. Ample oak lends coconut and vanilla elements that support the blackberry flavor. Creamy and fairly oaky on the finish.
If Tchelistcheff were still here, he might describe this Cab as an iron fist in a velvet glove. It's inviting in rich cassis, blueberry and chocolate flavors, with a soft mouthfeel. But the softness is deceptive; this is a big, deeply structured wine. Drink now through 2012.
Bay leaf, mint and cedar notes open this soft, nondescript wine, which is somewhat flat in tone and style. Mocha and cola notes provide flavor.

The intriguing nose suggests the ripe flesh of yellow plums drizzled with lemon juice, this is subtly aromatic and immensely appetizing.

If you have yet to discover Rotgipfler, you are in for a rewarding surprise.

Concentrated in cassis, cherry, plum, chocolate and new oak flavors, this is a young Cabernet, currently showing vibrant tannins and acidity. All the parts haven't come together, so you don't want to drink it now. It shows promise, and should be better after 2008.
Grainy, oaky aromas of clove, cinnamon and wood spice sit atop minimal white-fruit notes. This feels lean and linear, with overriding resiny barrel influences. Savory and forceful oak flavors dominate tart apple notes, while this offers mostly resin and spice on the finish.

Buttery oak aromas cover up any white-fruit character this Mallorcan white might have in store. Resiny, corny, overly oaky flavors finish like a bowl of buttered movie popcorn.
Pure blackberry aromas are friendly, however the palate is scratchy and sharp, with acidity that creates angularity and tartness. That's offset by generic black-fruit flavors and a touch of mocha. This is good Monastrell although the acidity is piercing.
A strong black pepper element leads on the nose of this spicy Shiraz from Stellenbosch. On the palate, robust red fruit and pepper and good tannic structure offer ageability and a good, everyday red for grilled meat and spicy dishes.
Big points for subtlety, length and elegance here—this is not a wine that will blow you away at first sniff. Stay with it and it stays with you; opening sharp-edged, pungent and slightly grassy, then developing a tightly focused midpalate with pure lime and apple fruit flavors.

With small additions of Petit Verdot and Merlot, this is a robust, full-bodied and affordable red that's thickly tannic at first before allowing a defined sense of vanilla oak and black cherry to speak in unison.

A charming wine at a fair price, with jump-out-of-the-glass potpourri scents backed up by lilies and a cut grass back note. It's a bit monotone in the mouth and has no great density but the pretty note of faded flower petals hangs around just long enough to make you forget all that. Drink up.
Bright fresh notes of greengage and lemon play on the nose. The palate has the same zippy fruit flavors which are ripe but remain resolutely fresh.

It closes after many long minutes with decisive tannins and cooling freshness. Drink after 2020.

A delicious Grenache sourced from Mendocino's Eaglepoint Vineyards, a high-elevation, cool-climate site with a peppery opening note that extends itself through dense chewy tannins and the bright fruitiness and inviting aromatics we all love about Grenache. A very nice bottle of wine with great backbone and depth that should age another 5–10 years.
92-94 Barrel sample. Well balanced wine, the spiced wood integrating well with the rich plum and berry juice fruits. Firm, but generous.

Serpico is a bold, larger-than-life wine, with beautiful aromatic intensity and notes of black fruit, espresso and crushed granite. Some 18 months of oak aging adds elements of dark spice and smoke; and the wine shows firm tannins and a long, polished mouthfeel. It's very elegant and should withstand many more years of cellar aging.
Aromas of toast, espresso and prune carry over to the lean, tannic palate. It's already extremely evolved and the fruit is drying up quickly. Drink through 2015.
Another fine proprietary red blend from this producer, this one holds a majority of Cabernet Franc with a sizable proportion of Merlot and smidgen of Cabernet Sauvignon.

Raspberry and cherry aromas are mild while not stirring much excitement. This feels a bit raw and tannic, but it's got enough body to hold up. Berry and plum flavors finish with hints of spice and chocolate.

Jammy, with flavors of white sugar, red and black cherries and buttered cinnamon toast. Drink with simple, sweet fare, like a hamburger with smothered onions, slathered in ketchup.
This Bordelais blend of 67% Sauvignon Blanc and 33% Sémillon is named for Fred Brander's son and offers a richer fragrance than his straight Sauvignon Blancs. Lemon, Gala apple and rounded key lime flavors make it approachable for many palates, yet buoyant acidity and wet cement and apple skin flavors bring added complexity.
Floral raspberry aromas carry a jammy scent. The palate on this Cabernet is grabby, with scouring tannins sitting in front of oaky berry and cassis flavors. On the finish, there's sweet blueberry, mint and pasty oak. This is good but oaky and a bit gummy.
With smoky new wood aromas and delicate fruit flavors, this wine hasn't quite come together. The fruit is light, but the wood structure isn't. Red berry fruits do show, but they are easily lost in the spice and heavy toast.
This formal, upright wine has solid, dense tannins and is well structured: with acidity and firm fruit, it shows its more opulent side slowly, leading to a smoky finish.
Despite tipping the scales at more than 15% alcohol, this wine actually comes across as nicely structured and elegant.

Intense aromatics seduce with a pungent mix of earth, leather, truffle and tobacco. Just-ripe wild berries, tea leaves and dried herbs join the chorus, while sweet tannins frame a lingering finish that invites further exploration.
Loosen's '09 auslese from the Sonnenuhr unleashes a cavalcade of ripe tropical fruit, ranging from pineapple and guava to carambola and lime. It's very sweet and isn't showing much more than fruit at this point in time, but it should develop additional complexity with cellaring.
Not an abundance of fruit here but the nose does show some nice minerality while a few gooseberry hints emerge in the mouth. The palate is on the watery side but is redeemed by some nice pear character that lingers on the finish. Drink up.
Don't even think of opening this Cab now. The tannins are hard, and they lock down the considerable blackberry, black currant, anise and dark chocolate flavors. It's a very fine wine. The 100% Cab grapes come from Howell Mountain, Atlas Peak, Mt. Veeder, Rutherford, St. Helena and Coombsville, making this a sort of international citizen of Napa Valley. 2011–2016.
Dusty potpourri and mineral tones lend an earthy tone to this lean, off-dry wine. It's fresh with lemon, lime and quince flavors, but straightforward in style with a brisk, herbal finish.
Tart and bright, with pretty cherry candy fruit flavor, this crisply defined Pinot Noir is annotated with rosemary, thyme and pepper. There's even a hint of pine needle—it's definitely Oregon, not California fruit—but well-made with good structure.
Giorgio Primo is among the best blended red wines from central Italy. It's a super Tuscan expression of Sangiovese, Merlot, Cabernet and Petit Verdot that delivers layer after layer of impressive richness, elegance and persistency. The aromas recall blackberry, ripe cherry, leather, tobacco, chocolate and espresso and thanks to the extraordinary quality of the mouthfeel, these flavors last seemingly forever on the palate.
Aromas that recall sugared plum, espresso, toast and underbrush lead the way on this robust wine. The densely concentrated palate offers stewed prune, vanilla, mocha, coffee and toasted oak alongside grainy tannins that leave a teeth-coating, tongue-drying finish. It's extremely ripe and you'll also detect the warmth of alcohol on close.
Importer and Master Sommelier Fran Kysela uses the Maison du Midi label for lots of Rhône wines he selects to bring into the U.S. This effort, from Plan de Dieu, is seriously intense, full-bodied and firmly tannic, showing the character of the vintage. The plummy fruit is powerful, fighting through the tannins on the finish. Try it young with rare beef, or put it away for a few years and see if the tannins soften over time.
While Merlot makes up the majority of this blend, the Cabernet Franc seems in the lead, with aromas of leafy green herbs, bell pepper, flowers and savory notes. The feel is silky and polished, showing richness and deftness with a finish that lingers. Some warmth holds it back.
A bit gaseous on the nose, with cidery apple aromas. The palate is waxy, oily and heavy, with chunky melon and papaya flavors. Meaty and full-bodied for a value-priced Chard, but also heavy and struggling for balance.
Another lovely Cab out of Red Hills Lake County, with nice tart cherry and dusty flavors, this wine is still quite tannic with good structure to age. The Sonoma-based Robledo family is making more and more wine from Red Hills, this one a tribute to patriarch Reynaldo "El Rey" Robledo.
There's an intensity of apricot and melon in this full-bodied, textured wine that veers on becoming overbearingly ripe, with a ghost-like finish.
Here's an elegant, full-bodied Cabernet packed with power and grace. It feels lush and classy in the mouth, a dry, softly tannic wine with rich flavors of blackberries, black currants and cedar. Drinks well now and should age well for 6–8 more years.
Easy to like for its incredibly rich flavors of blackberry jam and cola. The tannins are front and center, yet they're ripe and soft. Meanwhile, oak barrel aging brings a succulent jacket of toast. Doesn't taste like your typically ageable Mount Veeder wine, but it sure is delicious now.
White blossoms and wet stone softly caress on the nose. The flavors are layered and compelling, starting on crisp green apple, honeydew melon and peach, folding into complexities of crushed stone, fennel and pollen. Well-balanced, fresh acidity and ample body lend to a long, evolving finish.
Here's a brisk young Syrah whose acids and rustic tannins suggest drinking now with roasted and grilled meats, the fattier the better. Shows an interesting mélange of forest berries, dried currants, cured meats and spices.
This David Lake Signature Series wine blends two different clones, Sangiovese Piccolo and Sangiovese Grosso, and starts with a lovely, complex bouquet of rose petals, strawberry, watermelon, cherry and cocoa. It's supple, elegant and graceful, with pretty accents and subtle spicy highlights nicely spaced across the palate. A delicate, sensuous wine.
White peach and honey-butter aromas show on the nose of this richly styled bottling from one of the region's bigger producers. Salt and nectarine appear strongly on the palate, which is bound together by a very grippy texture. Waves of caramel pop toward the finish.
Morópio Amarone beautifully reflects the traditional values of Valpolicella with delicate aromas of blueberry, root beer, red apple and Spanish cedar. The apple aromas are vibrant and enhance the fruit nuances, and the wine is very fresh and tonic to the end.
A little light in flavor and length, this Pinot comes down more on the elegant side than the powerful. It's silky and dry, with pleasant raspberry-cherry, mocha, vanilla and Asian spice flavors.
This is a Merlot with dark plum flavors, integrated tannins and good structure. Juicy fruit and an appropriate level of herbaceousness in the background.
This gutsy blend of two-thirds Zinfandel plus Syrah and Tempranillo has a deep color, fresh spicy oak aromas, vivid fruit flavors and a lip-smacking layer of fine tannin. It should be just the thing with a grilled steak or pulled pork.
With a fine balance between some rigorous tannins and a more generous black-fruit character, this is a wine both to appreciate now and to age. The wine is perfumed, with spice from the wood aging and mint and thyme aromas. This serious wine is just ready to drink, but that would be a shame, so wait until 2018.
Named after the stagecoaches that used to travel through the Médoc, this château has produced an attractive, fruity wine in 2011. It has some tannins and firm wood-aging flavors, while the fruit is light and fresh. Drink from 2016.
A quirky blend of six wildly-different white grapes, this has some sweet fruit, some bitter phenolics, and a noticeable honeyed character, suggesting that there was some botrytis in the mix. Rich and loaded with flavors of lemon curd, apricot and ripe peaches, it's a creative, interesting wine, worth exploring at this price.
Talk about a ripped, structured wine that could use more rest. This pumps out minerally blackberry and coconut aromas along with raw, inky intensity. The wine's texture is defined by a strong tannic backbone, while flavors of burnt toast, bacon, licorice and black fruits finish with graphite and energy. Drink from 2015–2023.
This stylish and well-priced wine from Brian and Stephanie Terrizzi offers aromas of grape juice, shattered slate, charcoal ash and a sharp, peppery spice. The blackberry juice flavors are broad, approachable and pleasantly airy on the palate, but quickly given complexity with coyote-brush woodiness, iron shavings and a solid tannic grip.
This wine opens in a reduced way, with plenty of barrel influence apparent. It develops in the glass into a mix of chalky tannin and red and blue fruit, with accents of black licorice and white chocolate. Aged in new French, American and European oak, it has a tannic finish that should benefit with time. Drink now through 2021.
Young and boisterous, but nice and tasty. The color is violet, while the aromas are unchained and saturated. Flavors of black plum, ripe grapes and rubber make for uncommon richness, while the finish is sizable and real. Full tannins and some acidic punch ensure that it won't be taken lightly. Made by the people at La Legua.
Cabernet Sauvignon (37%) and Cabernet Franc (34%) make up the majority of this wine, with the balance Merlot (16%), Malbec (8%) and Petit Verdot. The aromas are quite locked up, with light notes of barrel spice, herb and assorted dark fruit. The palate has light tightly coiled fruit flavors. It needs time to reveal its charms. Best after 2021.
Fresh and crisp, this is a wine that has little flavor and only the thinest palate. It is bright to drink now.
Spice, herb, smoke and pencil-eraser aromas lead to elegant, tart fruit flavors that don't seem to have fully ripened.
96-98 A beautiful wine, concentrated and intense without tasting in any way extracted or forced. It has tannins, certainly, very dark and concentrated, but the fruit is black, powerful, rich, yet still maintaining purity and a sense of minerality from the vineyard.
The producer continues to up its game with this refined, cool-climate red that doesn't dare skimp on power and flavor. Herby, floral and elusive in waves, it's also voluptuously spicy and totally youthful in its big, dry tannin imprint.
This has a moderately strong streak of funk, barnyard, leather, whatever you want to call it, wrapped around sweet boysenberry fruit. It's not an immaculate conception of a wine, but it packs plenty of flavor, and the fruit has the kind of snap and tang that makes Washington Syrah stand out from the New World pack.
Could be a Sauvignon Blanc, with Meyer lemon, green apple and tropical fruit flavors, accented with crisp acidity. That's no disrespect. It's a compliment, in this age of clumsy, overoaked Chardonnays. Elegant and food-friendly, it's brightened with the acidity of a fresh lime.
Slightly sour Meyer-lemon-pith aromas meet with honeysuckle and yellow pear on the nose of this bottling by veteran Bob Lindquist. There is a strong sizzle of acidity on the sip, where green-apple flavors meet with tart nectarine and lime-peel zip. It's very fresh and food-friendly.
This full-bodied, creamy Crozes-Hermitage far outpaces expectations for the appellation, combining cherry-berry fruit with cracked pepper, mocha and licorice. Then it finishes long, anchored by a marriage of fruit and spice. It's ready to drink now, but should evolve positively through at least 2017.
This informal red opens with aromas of mature orange peel, red berry, sage and a whiff of cellar floor. The no frills palate offers tart red currant, red cherry, green pepper and star anise alongside racy acidity.
This dessert wine starts with an opulent nose of honey, apricot and spice, and on the palate, it has a rich, honeyed character of citrus and apricot. A generous amount of spice gives it spirit. Pair with cheeses, fruit.
Subtle, with low earthy tones set against a backdrop of black cherry and plum. The palate is crisp and intense, with a soft dusting of tannins. There are nice cherry and raspberry flavors on the finish but they fade a bit too quickly. Drink now.
This is the first round of wines from this project by John Wagner, who owns parts of Sierra Madre and John Sebastiano vineyards, and winemaker Paul Lato. Black-plum skins, roasted game, anise and sandalwood aromas show on the nose. Earthy and zesty, the palate delivers cranberry-beet juice along with roasted fennel, eucalyptus oil and bitter Earl Grey tea touches.
Hints of peach and blossom tell of aromatic varieties in this field blend. The palate confirms this with the rich, almost oily texture of rose oil. This is off dry but balanced: the richness seems to be contained in a cloud that bursts into aromatic atoms the moment you swallow. This makes you long for more and want to delve into the earthy, chalky depths.
A very nice, elegant and clean Cab that shows plenty of coastal climate balance. Fully dry, it has oak-accented flavors of blackberries, currants, mocha and spice. Good buy at this fair price.
A full, earthy, warm wine that has a strong herbal character as well as rich caramel and red fruits. It has a rare density for a rosé, textured and ripe. Try aging this wine for a  few months.
Deep in color, falling somewhere between copper and red. The nose is forward as could be, with raspberry and a strong hint of orange blossom. Solid across the palate, with dry berry flavors and a powerful edge of pepper. Based on Pinot Noir; you can taste the essence of that variety at its core.
Apricot, nectarine and mellow botrytis aromas are welcoming, while the palate is intense and citrusy, with full acidity. Flavors of orange, pineapple and mango are strong and tasty, while the finish is honeyed and layered. This is a punchy dessert wine that will age well for several years; drink now through 2013.
A big, brawny version of the variety, this is tight and tannic, steeped in leather pouch, black pepper and garrigue. Swirl around in the bottle or glass before sipping, or pair it with braised, leathery meats. A core of acidity helps lift the finish.
Schiefer means “slate,” but this wine's stoniness is softer, less severe than that, cushioned under layers of superripe pear and spices that resemble cinnamon or clove and ginger. There's ample weight and richness on the palate despite a sense of dryness, and the wine finishes long, with hints of ripe peach.
A deliciously zesty Sauvignon Blanc. It doesn't seem to have any oak, but you won't miss it, because there are wonderful vanilla, honeysuckle and buttered toast notes that enrich the peach, pineapple, green apple, honeydew melon and mineral flavors. Great price for a wine so rich and complex.
This blend of 47% Grenache, 35% Mourvèdre and 18% Syrah is reminiscent of a walk through the dewy sagebrush, with dried wild herbs most prominent alongside cola, rustic plum and mulberry and a hint of pine forest. Those forest-like flavors show on the sip as well, with bay leaf, green peppercorn and a savory salts enhancing the baked berry and tangy plum skin elements—a GSM with teeth and structure.
Ripe and plummy in explosive fruit and heat, this wine shows cherry-berry jamminess wrapped in a leathery, meaty package dusted in cinnamon and brown sugar.
Gold in color, with good texture. Somewhat short on intensity, however, with ample oak, almond, apple and pear flavors. Weighty but not terribly expressive. Appropriate acidity, good with salmon and the like. Imported by Ex-Cellars Wine Agencies, Inc.
Bright cherry and blueberry notes combine with hints of leather, earth, crushed pepper and grapeseed on the nose of this bottling. It's relatively light in body, showing peppery verve on the palate plus blueberry-elderberry fruit and bay-leaf herbals.
In the dry style of Blin Champagnes, this is a fruity and very crisp wine. Sliced apples and crisp pears are cut with pink grapefruit and other citrus flavors. It is fresh with acidity that balances the fruit. The texture at the end is soft, lightly mineral.
This is a genuine but simple interpretation of Barbera d'Asti Superiore with fresh fruit layers and vibrant tones of cherry, cranberry and pomegranate. This easy-pairing food wine boasts cleansing acidity, medium density and a polished finish.
Tarry, rubbery cherry and chocolate aromas turn towards olive as this breathes. Raw, rubbery and mildly astringent in feel, this tastes like plum and tomato with herbs and salt.
Gorgeous fruit aromas, generous and deep fruit flavors and soft, chocolate accents add up to a very flavorful but relaxed wine. Touches of clove and cedar pop up with the second sip, while some welcome tannins clean the palate. The fruit flavors come back on the finish. It is full-bodied but very smooth.
Bright and aromatic on the nose with loads of fresh apples, florals and honeycomb notes, there's an elegance to this sheer, somewhat delicate icewine. Striking acidity and a nice astringent note carry through a long, clean finish.
This zippy, fruit-forward wine opens with bright raspberry and pungent spice aromas, adding in milk chocolate streaks through a supple, medium-weight middle. The finish gets a little tight, with some plastic flavors creeping in.
Green pear peel, fresh cucumber and ripe, golden pears all unite to make a rounded, toothsome food wine that's also crisp and savory.
Spine-tingling acidity cuts a fine edge through this buoyantly fruity but nuanced wine. The palate is lip-smackingly sweet-tart, bursting of ripe raspberry and yellow cherry flavors that stretch out a long, spicy finish. Drink now through 2020.
Tough in tannins, hard in acids, and funky, this Cabernet is difficult to appreciate now despite obviously ripe blackberries and cassis. It resists the palate's attempts to break it down, and finishes with a firm astringency. Maybe it will age out. Try after 2014.
Sophisticated and subtle, this lovely wine expresses varietal elegance, with a bouquet of roses and raspberries to begin. The jumble of pretty fruits is framed with citrus peel and a dusting of chocolate.
This is a massive, powerful Chardonnay, a New World style that's superripe and heavily oaked. You either like it or you don't. Aficionados of this approach will love the opulence of the honey, pineapple jam, apricot, crème brûlée, vanilla and buttercream flavors. Calls for very rich dishes, like lobster.
Floral red fruit aromas carry a hint of minerality and garrigue. The palate is lively, with good overall balance. Tastes of ripe red plum, raspberry and vanilla, while the finish is light in weight and quick, but satisfying.
This full-bodied wine conveys aromas of spiced plum, chocolate, toast and incense. The robust palate offers dried black cherry, exotic spice, licorice, white pepper and espresso but not much fruit richness. Astringent tannins leave a tongue-drying finish.
An immediately attractive wine that is bursting with black currant fruitiness. Along with light tannins and red berry fruits, it is fresh without any hint of wood aging. The wine is ready to drink.
Fairly young and needing some time to flesh out, this blend still has much to offer now. The firm tannins play well against the rich vanilla and spice notes; throw in some serious black cherry and raspberry, and the wine comes into focus beautifully. Drink now–2011.
Rich and opulent, this opens with toasted aromas of spice and nut, backed by accents of ripe fruit and blackberry jelly. The mouthfeel is soft, supple and slightly sweet.
Unbelievably rich and delicious, this is a joy to drink. It continues the winery's long record with this vineyard, reaching toward its apex with this 2009. Made from 100% Cabernet and aged in nearly two-thirds new French oak, it's elaborate, layered and complex, offering juicy notes of blackberry, black currant and dark chocolate, with sweet toast and vanilla flavors that continue onto the spicy finish. If you can keep your hands off it, this will develop over the next 10–15 years.
Dark and heavily oaked, so if you're into big wines with char, bacon and a lot of spice, this is it...and it's only $14. The palate is tannic and drawing, but lively and loaded with charred, lemony, black fruit flavors. A junior-level, wannabe bigtime Rioja that hints at the region's potential for greatness.
A surprisingly good little Syrah. The nose is full and dark, albeit a bit damp. The mouthfeel is big and rubbery but sound, with blackberry and chocolate flavors. Lightly toasted and jammy as well. Good stuff for the money.
Round and fruity, with sweet, attractive aromas. The palate is a bit dark for cava, with plum and bitter chocolate flavors. The feel is soft and foamy, with a dry, roasted note on the finish. Clear as can be; easy to tell that it's Pinot Noir. Imported by CIV/USA.
Celebrating 500 years as grape growers, the Mellot family offers this top Sancerre. It is rounded and spicy with a touch of wood to add to its rich character. Apricots and pineapple are a delicious addition to the citrus acidity that cuts right through the wine. Age for 3–4 years.
Very light and fresh, this offers crisp red berry flavors. It's not quite dry, favoring fruitiness and acidity with a touch of sweetness to soften the crisp aftertaste.
This wine lacks the richness and texture of Knipser's Im Großen Garten bottling, but more than makes up for it with complex notes of spring flowers, bergamot, spice and mineral. Long and crisp on the finish, with potential to possibly improve up to 10 years.
From the heartland of Chardonnay in Champagne comes this rich, creamy, apple-flavored wine. It has lively acidity, balanced with some sweetness from the dosage. It has weight and a crisp aftertaste.
Well-textured fruit—red plum skins, bright berries—floating on some tight tannins makes for good structure, the clean, fresh juicy flavors followed by a firm finish. Drink now, or keep for 1–2 years. Imported by Louis Latour Inc.
A rich, perfumed and juicy wine, it is full of fruit and also solidly structured. Coming into balance, it still needs some more time. Give this full-bodied, dense wine until 2017.
This is the first white bottling from a new project by John Wagner, co-owner of John Sebastiano and Sierra Madre vineyards, and winemaker Paul Lato. Flint, dried limes, chives and a touch of smoked chicken show on the fresh nose. Light and clean on the sip, it's distinctive with flavors of buttered lemon slices, smoke and sweet onions.
Classic Viognier apricot flavors are prominent in this ripe, full wine. It's as poised as it is rich—full of fruit, with a warm, rounded aftertaste.
Full and fat with a delightful mix of tropical fruit and new oak spiciness. Both a creamy texture and good acid—a feat in itself—offset nicely the rich pineapple, peach, coconut, clove and exotic spice flavors. Has style, balance and length. Drink this Carneros champ now and over the next two years. Top Value.
An unusual level of flavor concentration and density of texture make this wine substantive in mouthfeel, intriguing in depth, and a good wine to age for a few years. It has touches of sage and sweet oak in the aroma, plus full-bore flavors of blackberry and black cherry on the palate. With great structure due to firm tannins and acidity, it will be best to drink after 2019.
Made with 100% native grape Cortese, this opens with aromas of apricot, white spring flower and a hint of beeswax. The medium-bodied palate delivers white peach, honeydew melon and a hint of white almond alongside bright acidity.
This is a light, nondescript white wine, with a trace of sweetness on the finish.
Fresh plum, blackberry, loamy earth and tobacco leaf elements shine on the nose of this bottling from the Uvas Canyon area between Morgan Hill and Gilroy. It's straightforward on the palate with decent acidity and a light body presenting plum paste, anise and cedar flavors.
Even after five years, this wine still shows its primary fruit—black plums, sweet but structured. Callabriga, a Tinta Roriz based wine, goes light on the acidity, but the tannins and the hints of vanilla balance well with the blackberry jam fruits.
Owned by art collector Philippe Raoux, who has filled the park of the chateau with impressive sculptures, this estate produces serious and complex wines. This latest release continues in that tradition. It is rich, structured and full of swathes of black fruit. The wine will take time, so wait until 2021.
Barrel spice, pineapple, butterscotch and candlewax aromas are followed by full-bodied tropical-fruit flavors. It displays a lot of richness but retains its sense of balance.
Easy to drink, this has crisp, zesty acidity, showing melange of citrus, melon, green apple and spice flavors that finish with a note of honey.
Spice and saltiness are corralled into a tight frame of citrus freshness. The palate is zesty while the varietal white pepper and herb notes of Grüner shimmer here and there. Very slender with a refreshing, lively palate.
The bouquet is filled with the aromas of honey and overripe oranges and pears. The wine is very orangey on the palate, without a lot of nuance, but it finishes long, buoyed by mouthwatering acidity.
Despite the effects of a cool year, this wine is still enjoyable. Its cherry fruit is tinged with notes of root vegetables and beet greens, and while there's ample weight, the tannins are just a touch drying on the finish.
A suitable quaffer, this nonvintage bottling could be mistaken for almost any white varietal. Thin flavors of apple and pear fall flat in the mouth.
Joe Dobbes pioneered this variety in Oregon, and it's a rare but welcome addition to the growing pantheon of food-friendly white wines. Light flavors of lemon and citrus touch gently on peach and mango, buoyed with fresh, crisp acidity. Not as dense as past vintages, but deliciously elegant.
Smells and tastes burnt, whether from charred oak or cooked berries or maybe a combination of both. Either way, has a stewed fruit taste that detracts.
This is a tough wine to evaluate. On the one hand, there's plenty of concentration and ripeness, reflected in the wine's high-toned raspberry fruit, ample weight and rich, creamy texture. On the other hand, the alcohol is a bit elevated (16%) and there's almost 1.5% residual sugar, so it's sweet on the finish.
Weak aromas of peach pit and tropical fruit are none too exciting, while the palate is dilute and carries flavors of orange and lime. Too narrow to warrant a recommendation, with barely any concentration.
Very pure notes of conference pear charm on the nose and palate, which is taut and slender. A citric verve makes for liveliness. With some air, subtler notes of pepper appear alongside gossamer-like phenolics. Typical for the 2014 vintage this is light but also clean with subtle, earthy spice. No fewer than 17 co-planted varieties from an old vineyard go into this. Savor that pepper.
A simple but likeable Chard, with pretty apple and peach flavors and lots of crushed hard spices, like cinnamon and nutmeg. Has a touch of smoky oak. The K-J style really hasn't changed much over the years: Pick the grapes ripe, keep things slightly sweet and get some wood notes in.
Syncline's winemaker James Mantone is putting out a fascinating lineup of single-vineyard 100%-varietal wines from unusual grapes like Grenache Blanc. Lime and grapefruit scents and flavors are evident, along with light Asian pear and jicama highlights. The cool vintage emphasizes a gin-like botanical flavor. This is a balanced effort, with a medium-long finish.
This vintage of San Rustico's Amarone seems more closed and reserved compared to last year. You'll get broad spice aromas and ripe cherry fruit, but the estate's characteristic intensity is less evident. It's an easy and genuine wine overall that will pair with lamb or pork.
Solidly in the Hall style of voluptuous, stylish Cabernets, rich in fruit and softly sweet. With a flood of blackberries, cassis and chocolate, it's intricately structured with finely ground tannins that give a sting of astringency. Probably best consumed soon with rich beef dishes.
This is the producer's first vintage from this vineyard—the grapes were previously sold. The site, which sits within Green Valley as well as the Sonoma Coast, is planted to the same clone as sister property Quail Hill, in coveted Goldridge soils. Soft, round and decadent, the wine is full bodied, with bursts of red fruit and crushed stone.
The Seze family has owned this estate since the 18th century, producing in 2009 a finely textured wine, one that has juicy black fruits and an elegant structure. It is a more structured take on the vintage, firm with dry tannins and acidity.
This is tight, toasty and focused upon opening, with highlights of green olive and a core of mixed tree fruits. Excellent concentration, vivid acidity and a suggestion of wet rock contribute to a well-balanced wine with structure and length. The framing here is just right, with 30% new oak adding subtle threads of light wood flavors. Decant or cellar till 2020 before drinking.
Opens with horsey aromas that suggest saddle leather, herbs and rubbery fruit. Airing helps it along, revealing a lifted palate with nice acidity and dry raspberry, tea, spice and leather flavors. Herbal on the finish, but good as a whole.
Sweet pea blossoms, stone fruits and red raspberries perfume this lovely dry rosé made predominantly from Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon. Sparkling acidity and an astringent tea-leaf note add structure to the ripe, supple red-fruit and berry flavors.
The wine is full of ripe berries, red and black fruit flavors. Soft tannins are a subtext to the main fruitiness. Although the tannins are still dry, they will soften to give a fresh wine that will age quickly. Drink from 2016.
This single-vineyard selection brings black cherry and graham cracker flavors, with a background of stem and herb. Somewhat muted, it could benefit holding to 2017–2018 in bottle.
Ripe, rich and overall yummy, this Syrah offers bright notes of red plum and cherry laced with a touch of gaminess and soft foliage. The medium-weight mouthfeel boasts fine tannins and prominent acidity that provides a nice lift to the long, spicy finish.
This is a very strong showing for a brand new brand, thanks, no doubt, to veteran winemaker Jeff Fink's involvement. Tight on the nose with Meyer lemon pith, savory salts and a waft of oak smoke, the palate explodes with chalky tension and rich yet bright complexity. Flavors of white lily, peach and sea salt ride atop melted butter, leading into a caramelized finish.
This is Eola Hills fruit, though the label simply says “Oregon.” It carries some of the region's characteristic youthful aromas of tomato leaf mixed with moist earth. Plenty of acid provides good definition; right now it's got all the right components but they remain angular and separate. The stiff and lean tannins indicate that this will benefit from some cellaring.
Opening with a bouquet of stemmy earth, lavender and the perfume of a rose garden, this supple, meaty wine is rich in red and blue fruit that's full bodied and concentrated. It finds a freshness in its tangy cranberry finish.
This hay-colored Moscato Giallo is redolent of melon, pineapple and honey. The mouthfeel is soft, plush and there's a playful touch of zesty spice on the close.
This is dry, crisp and minerally; it's made in a lighter style that makes it especially food friendly. The flavors suggest oranges, apricots and tart Meyer lemons.
This light pink rosé has aromas of lemongrass, mango and eucalyptus. On the palate there are strawberries and cream and raspberry. There is a slight touch of creaminess and roundness to the body with a crisp finish.
With some wood aging, Cuvée Edmond is generally released a year later than other whites from Alphonse Mellot. The wine is beautifully rounded, a rich, complex Sauvignon Blanc that shows ripe apricots, pears, spice and sweet, luscious acidity.
Surh Luchtel knows how to make a great Cab. The '05 is a beautiful wine, softly complex and layered, with black currant, cherry, mocha, sweet oak and spicy flavors. But it's tannins that really mark this wine. They're so fine, so authoritative. Drink now–2010.
Shy aromas of cherries, peppery herbs, char and spiced mocha lead to a light- to medium-bodied palate that feels silky and slick. Bright acidity gives the finish some lift, and it ends on an accent of cherry lozenge.
Structured and powerful, it features aromas of underbrush, leather, spice, plum cake and subtle oak. The concentrated palate delivers juicy black cherry and red raspberry accented with notes of espresso alongside tightly packed tannins and fresh acidity. Give it time to unwind. Drink after 2020.
This is ripe, fat and with melon and green-plum flavors. It has a spicy edge along with ripe acidity. The wine, with its full fruitiness, is ready to drink.
This cru is a solid wine. It has a dense structure spearheaded by the tannins and lifted by acidity. Black plum and berry fruits are still developing behind the firm facade. It will take some time to develop, so wait until early 2019.
Sharp and spicy, this blend of Mourvèdre, Grenache and Cinsault leaves a slightly yeasty finish. The three grapes seem a bit at odds, not entirely comfortable in the same bottle. A second bottle was tasted, and the fruit flavors—especially from the Grenache—proved to be more focused and pure.
A very fine effort. The wine is full flavored without being punishing. There's plenty of cassis and plum, and nothing syrupy about it. Great balance across the entire palate, with a Bordeaux-like elegance. Notes of iron filings, chalk and light herb complete the picture. 150 cases produced.
A round and pleasant wine with melon, toast and pear aromas and flavors, but a bit on the sweet side. Bright citrus and peach notes add interest, a touch of chalk keeps the sweetness in check, and the oak comes up dramatically on the back end.
This is a serious Toro wine with smooth, dark, leathery aromas along with hints of wintergreen, licorice and berry pastry. It feels rich and layered, with complex flavors of licorice gum drop, nutmeg, chocolate and blackberry. Almost decadent but not over the top or too tannic. Drink now–2016.
90-92. Barrel sample. The tannins show in this wine's very dry and firm core. There is minerality and a tight texture. Under the tannins, there is a juicy fruit layer with a black-currant character.
Merlot makes up three-quarters of this blend, with the balance Cabernet Sauvignon (21%) and Cabernet Franc. It starts out a bit reduced, providing some initial distraction from its aromas of plum, herb, asphalt and currant. The blue-fruit and smoke flavors show a sense of plushness, with savory notes lingering on the finish. The tannins bring some grip. It provides enjoyment but the Merlot doesn't really pop and the smoky notes seem out of place.
Showing the rustic edge that sometimes characterizes wines from Listrac, this still offers smooth new wood and tight blackberry fruit flavors. It is still developing, with the wood probably too prominent.
This has just the right balance between the fresh fruit of younger Ports and the wood and dried fruit of aged tawnies. It's a dry style of Port, with a lift of acidity. It's delicious and, like all aged tawnies, ready to drink now.
Confected and soapy with exuberant baby powder and floral tones, this dry, medium-bodied Bulgarian Muskat Ottonel is an uneven, craggy wine with shriekingly high acidity.
This wine delivers bang for the buck as well as fine characteristics. On the bouquet, there's leather, black cherry and so much depth it's as if you're looking down a well. Juicy yet firm on the palate, with plum, raspberry and chocolate flavors. Soft tannins don't mean it's flabby; rather they offer early drinkability.
Engaging aromas of fresh rose, iris, perfumed berry and hint of menthol meld together in the glass. On the taut palate, notes of white pepper, clove and anise add some depth to the sour cherry core. Assertive tannins and nervous acidity offer focused support while a hint of juicy raspberry backs up the finish. Drink 2018–2026.
This is hands-down the best value Pinot Noir made in Oregon, year in and year out. It's firm and full-bodied, perfectly ripe, with lovely spices that range from pepper to cinnamon and allspice. The fruit lingers in the midpalate, round and tangy, with flavors of cherry and plum. It's a thoroughly rich and satisfying wine that is big enough to work with dark poultry, salmon and even veal.
This very dark colored wine is all about young fruit—black cherries and berries—and vivid acidity. The tannins are soft, and the wine will be ready to drink this autumn.
Light, subtle pink color echoes this wine's subdued nature on the palate, which reveals whispers of orange peel, strawberry and rose as it opens.
Sometimes a young Pinot is deceptive. This wine is young and silky, supple and fruity and has some sharp acidity, but it doesn't overwhelm. It's the kind of wine that doesn't overshadow food. But it's excellent Pinot. The depth of flavor and long finish suggest aging possibilities, but there's no reason not to drink and enjoy it now.
This wine is so ripe, rich and generous in flavor it's almost jammy, but there's no denying the appeal of all that fruitiness. Full body, velvety texture and soft acidity make it plush on the palate, helping the rich finish linger. Although it was aged in French barriques—two-thirds new—it's by no means an overoaked wine.
Biodynamically-farmed, old vine fruit from the Eola Hills vineyard is the source. The wine is forward and tangy, with a Vouvray-like sweet/sour character. It could be Chenin Blanc, only just a bit lighter, but with the same tart and tasty mix of acid and sugar, with lemony fruit and floral highlights. Really tasty.
This relatively lightweight Pinot Noir features an array of meaty, earthy notes and a modest pie-cherry flavor before drying out and turning even more tart on the finish. Drink now.
I like this smooth, dry wine, although it's rather overworked. The oak and lees are a bit obvious, yet the papaya and peach fruit flavors, and the acidity, are powerful enough to make it all work.
This opens with bold aromas of Golden Delicious apple, vanilla, yellow rose, pear and white almond. The mouthfeel is oily and dense, with a touch of sweet spice.
One of the library releases from Nikolaihof, this has become a light, elegant wine that walks a tightrope between freshness and mature smoke and toast flavors. Smooth almonds and spiced apples are beautifully ready to drink.
This fresh and fruity wine has good acidity along with black currant fruits. It is fresh and rounded with a firm layer of tannins in the background.
Given 22 months in new French oak, this reserve Pinot Noir still brings the fruit front and center. Blackberries rule here, but there is a strong menthol/mint streak as well, which leaves the palate feeling as if a curiously strong breath mint has recently passed through. Kason seems to have great fruit sources, packaged in a rather rustic style, but offering quite delicious and bold flavors at moder prices.
Earthy, chalky aromas and dry, savory flavors take the lead in this engaging, light-bodied wine, while any fruitiness is quite subtle. It's interesting and unusual in style, yet should pair nicely with appetizers and seafood due to its bracing acidity.
This single-vineyard blend is drinking very well. There is an unusual minty spice underlying the cassis and cherry fruit, and it provides a nice line for the flavors as they weave across the palate. This wine is among the best balanced of the 2007 reds from Fidélitas, and shows some well-managed herbs and baking spice flavors along with soft, light tannins.
The nose is subdued but eventually reveals whiffs of pressed white flower and dried herb. The rather lean palate offers hints of green pear, citrus, mineral and a note of bitter almond.
This mature Muscadet is one that is in peak condition. In losing its youthful acidity, it has gained a depth of flavor and ripe apple and pear fruits that give it intensity as well as a strongly perfumed character. Drink this wine now.
This Cabernet equivalent to Grange has exploded in price (I remember tasting the 1996 on release when it was $25 per bottle), but there's no questioning the quality. A deep, intense nose of cassis, earth, menthol and cedar is followed by a full, rich palate that's supple without being soft. Brighter notes of red fruit emerge on the lengthy finish, which is dominated by sweet fruit and creamy lactones. Drink 2020–2030, and probably well beyond.
Rich and dry, with a smooth, tannic structure framing ripe flavors of blackberries, cherries, smoky oak and dusty Asian spices. Shows lots of class for this price.
Harsh and rustic, with jellied berry and red pepper flavors. Feels soft, simple and sweet. The blend is Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah.
Very young, this wine is just setting out. It has firm tannins, dark-chocolate flavors that give some bitterness and layers of wood and dark-black fruits from organic grapes. It is going to take time for this ripe concentrated wine to develop. The acidity and black-plum-skin texture at the end show it will age. Drink from 2020.
At 15.9% abv, this is a monster by Finger Lakes standards, but it's unsurprising perhaps for such a hot vintage. A tad jammy on the palate, it's sweet with red cherry fruit that's framed by herbaceous green notes and layers of soft, furry tannins.
The nose suggests utter generosity of ripe juicy pear fruit. The palate enforces this with rounded, aromatic and very pure notes of ripe Bartlett pear. The flavors are precisely drawn, framed by incisive freshness that corsets the richness and gives it a beautiful outline. There is barely concealed strength here and great energy. You can feel the warmth of the sun that ripened these lovely grapes. The finish is lasting and dry. Drink 2017—2030.
A pale rosé from Pinot Noir, this is light and fresh, with an intense acidity that cuts through the fruitiness. It's a fine apéritif style with its crisp texture and lively aftertaste.
Toast, truffle, coconut and oak aromas unfold on this robust wine. The densely concentrated palate shows dried black cherry, bitter chocolate and oak-driven spice alongside austere, teeth-coating tannins that leave an astringent finish. It doesn't have quite enough fruit richness to stand up to the oak sensations.
Round and fruity, this is big, forward and loaded with ripe stone fruit, melon and a finishing lick of citrus. Fresh and lively, it's ready for immediate enjoyment.
San Giorgio is an historic wine that represents an international variety, Cabernet Sauvignon, married to a local one: Sangiovese. The results are soft and generous and although you can recognize characteristics of both, the fruit is perfectly ripe and balanced.
There's 3% each of Grenache and Petite Sirah in this wine that is quite ripe and straightforward in its fruity waves of blackberry, cherry and oaky chocolate. Firm tannins don't overwhelm, opting instead to support and structure. Black pepper leaves a lasting impression on the finish.
Tastes kind of thin and simple, with watery flavors of peaches, alcohol and oak that finish quick. But it's a clean, balanced wine.
This is traditional Barossa Shiraz, aged in new American oak hogsheads, which have imparted a thick layer of vanilla and dill over the top of some lovely blackberry-tinged fruit. The texture is creamy, the tannins, supple, the finish infused with notes of coffee, spun sugar and spice. Drink now–2014, possibly longer. Imported by AUSA Pacific, LLC.
This is the second wine of Labégorce, named as a remembrance of the separate château Labégorce-Zédé that was purchased in 2005. It is a firm wine, with a perfumed character from the judicious wood aging. The tannins are likely to remain part of the character of this wine, working with the black-currant fruit and the final, smoky flavor. Drink from 2017.
This is a nice, crisp and properly varietal Gewürztraminer. It's dryish to semi-sweet, with pleasant citrus fruit, lychee, green apple and honeysuckle flavors, liberally spiced. There's no oak at all.
Nice, friendly aromas feature leafy notes and dry, herbal fruit. The palate is narrow and high in acidity, which pushes the fruit flavors toward raspberry and tart black cherry. Remains lean in scope across the finish, where edgy apple skin flavors take over. Good and honest, but hard and scratchy.
The red wine is rich, dense and packed with fruit and tannins. It comes from the heart of the Lisboa region, giving plenty of structure from the cool-climate vineyards. There are fine red-fruit flavors shot through by juicy acidity. The wine has a drier, still developing tannic aftertaste. Drink from 2017.
Full in the mouth, this is a soft caramel and orange zest-flavored wine. It has light acidity, although probably not enough to give a balance. The aftertaste brings pepper and spice.
A solid Chardonnay that will satisfy fans of the variety. It's a sleekly tart, streamlined wine, with vanilla oak and buttered toast influences acting on the pineapples and green apples. Finishes a little sweet, but crisp.
Corvina, Rondinella and Dindarella—three grapes native to the Verona area of Northern Italy—make up this fresh and lively, easy-sipping rosé. The wine awards pretty aromas of raspberry and white cherry.
There's a lingering vein of sweet Indian spice amidst pretty layers of sweet pea and lime pith on this intense Riesling. Dry in style yet densely concentrated with juicy, sweet yellow peaches, it finishes long with sharp, racy acidity.
This Chardonnay has an appealing nose that's both fruity and toasty, with complex, lush flavors of Chardonnay fruit, vanilla and toasted wood. A spirited but elegant wine that will pair well with poultry, cheeses or richer fish.
Einaudi's wines have been improving lately, and this Barolo was very impressive, given the trying conditions of the vintage. Big rich, fat with smoked meat and a good dose of oak, the wine was one of the few that didn't peter out early but stayed on the palate to the end, culminating in an nice easy finish.
From the Frediani Vineyard, this is a blend of 76% Cabernet Sauvignon and 24% Cabernet Franc. Perfumed in lavender and a grip of blackberry jam, it also imparts characteristics of plum and clove, allowing both varieties to speak. Smooth on the finish, it's robustly full bodied and fleshy to the end.
Perfumed strawberry aromas show well. On the palate, this wine is fruity, jammy in texture with good balancing acidity. The tannins still need to soften, so drink from 2017.
50% Cabernet Sauvignon and 25% Merlot with the balance Cabernet Franc and Malbec, it brings notes of brandy soaked cherry, licorice, herbs and barrel spices. The fruit flavors are plush in feel and tart with tightly wound, dry tannins.
A very nice blend, midway between a reserve and a single vineyard wine. The “Cuvée” series from Rex Hill is designed to express the nuances of several of the newest AVAs and sub-AVAs in the state. This excellent bottle is soft and approachable, with pretty fruit. It lacks a bit of concentration, but what is there is flavorful, with hints of rose petals and raspberries.
This collaboration between American winemakers Greg Brewer and Steve Clifton and Japanese entrepreneur Takahide Sugimoto is stunningly high-toned and buttoned-up at first, with sour cream, yogurt, crushed ant, gunmetal, flint and quinine elements on the nose. The palate is complex and fascinating, with chalk and cement minerality bolstered by lime blossom, kumquat and tonic that opens graciously with time. Drink 2016–2026.
Aromas of woodland berry, iris and menthol lift out of the glass. Vibrant and linear, the focused palate offers cherry, cranberry, wild herb and white pepper framed in firm tightly wound tannins and bright acidity. Drink 2023–2033.
Baked plum, roasted coffee bean, toast and a whiff of grilled herb lead the nose. The concentrated palate offers dried black cherry, blackberry jam and licorice alongside assertive tannins that leave a mouth-puckering finish. The fruit is showing signs of drying out so drink sooner rather than later.
If you're looking for sheer flash in Napa Valley Cabernet, try this one. It's expensive, but worth the price. It dazzles for soft lusciousness, and the depth and complexity of blackberries, black currants, cassis and chocolate, as well as the perfect integration of new French oak. Yet the wine, which contains a splash of Malbec, is dry and balanced in acidity and velvety tannins. Great now, and will continue to please through 2022.
This upper-end bottling from the metalworks-minded winery shows black plum, black loam and charred pasilla chile on the nose. The palate is soft and lush, with a proper tannic presentation for the grape, showing more black cherry and a pinch of dill flavors.
This is a great success. Youthful tannins exude power and vitality, combining with great fruit concentration, the elements coming together with sweet chocolate and cocoa as added richness. A tasty wine that is developing well.
Dark and spicy, with rubber and baked-fruit aromas giving way to herbs, clove and other alluring spice scents. As might be expected from a wine bearing Alvaro Palacios' signature and approval, the final product is smart and snappy, with blackberry, herbs and barrel char all making themselves noticed. Good now and for the next several years.
The acids hit you first. They perk up a creamy wine with pleasant flavors of cherries, cola, mocha and spice. It's dry and balanced. The impression is of a lovely Pinot that combines delicacy and elegance with power. Drink now and over the next four years.
They say the vines average 80 years of age, which means who knows where those old roots have explored. For that matter, who knows what the grape varieties really are. The wine is the least fruity of the winery's current Zins. While it shows berry-cherry and licorice flavors, it's notable for hard-to-describe earthy, mineral and mushroomy tastes that are interesting and unique.
Fermented and aged in four-year-old French oak barrels, this wine is ripe, creamy and fruity. It has a rounded character with flavors of pears and apricots to give richness. Refreshing with its zing of acidity at the end, it is ready to drink. Robert Perroud's family has been making wine since 1789. He began a vineyard conversion to biodynamic practices and considers making wine an art.
Intense, penetrating and bold, this is the kind of tannic Umbrian wine you'll want to pair with polenta and beef stew or wild boar. Sagrantino di Montefalco is a naturally structured and hearty wine but this expression supplements the overall experience with delicate tones of Indian spice, black fruit and root beer. Drink after 2012.
This wine is on the lean side, with a black currant flavor, tight tannins and intense acidity. Although it shows fruitiness, the main thrust is severe.
The wine is fruity, bright and with cherry flavors. With its soft tannins and juicy acidity, it is a cru wine to drink young. The aftertaste is all fruit.
Shows fine pedigree in the ripeness and finesse of the tannins, which are as pure as velvet. Flavorwise, this Syrah is very ripe, bursting in blackberry, black cherry, pomegranate, licorice and mocha flavors that are almost sweet on the finish. It's made in the modern Napa style, and not an ager.
Cassis and chocolate notes dominate, but there's enough minty, eucalypt character to impart complexity, all framed by some firm, dusty tannins. Finishes long and mouthwatering; drink now–2015. Multiple U.S. importers.
Mature black-skinned fruit, forest floor, leather and dark spice aromas come together on this hearty red. The full-bodied, assertive palate offers dried black cherry, prune, licorice and pipe tobacco framed in firm, fine-grained tannins. Drink 2017–2024.
With clean aromas of wet stone and grapefruit blossom, this bright, slightly pulpy Godello delivers round grapefruit and nectarine flavors in front of a powerful, peachy, melony finish with kick. This is no wallflower white. Match with grilled fish.
This wine blends 53% Monterey County and 47% San Luis Obispo County fruit to deliver a well-priced winner. Key lime, lemon peel, white flowers and almond butter show on the nose, while the palate delivers nicely rounded nectarine, sea salt and oaky flavors that are buoyed by ample acidity through the finish.
This run-of-the-mill wine lacks much in the way of varietal character, and has an overbearing taste of alcohol.
This is young, dominated by some spicy wood and quite densely textured fruit and tannin. Impressive for a branded wine, all vibrant fruit, balanced by a firm, dry structure, and with a rich aftertaste. Age this for at least 1 year.
A clean and refreshing rosé, this opens with attractive scents of red cherry, strawberry and a hint of clementine. The medium-bodied mouthfeel is balanced by a good cut of vibrant acidity and bright fruit flavors. Melon and citrus rind flavors kiss the fleeting finish. Drink now.
Smoky and confected, with candied apple and sugared peach notes that come across as cloying.
Starts out very light in mouthfeel, almost delicately simple, with such a dry, wispy texture that it feels almost inconsequential. Then you notice the flavors of cola, tart cherryskin, ripe rhubarb, coffee, Asian spices and caramelized oak. They mingle together in a complex swirl that makes you want another sip.
From the winery's lightly oaked series of wines, this bottling is all about freshness. It shows pomegranate, dried fennel and sagebrush on the nose. The palate is zesty, uncomplicated and eminently drinkable, with sagebrush elevating the fruit-punch base.
This is crisp and refreshing, although it shows little of the complex aromatics that some Rieslings obtain. Scents and flavors of green apples and white peaches carry through onto the modest finish.
A medium-bodied Shiraz that turns crisp and savory on the finish, this wine's core of blackberry and black cherry fruit is nicely embellished with shadings of spice and toasty oak. Drink now–2012.
Tart and bright and not terribly complex, this is nonetheless a good value. There's minerality and spice there too, which spicy grilled lamb or beef will enhance.
Mocha, cola, dark cherry and berry aromas are mild, but they pick up power on the supple, polished-feeling palate.
A rich nose of apple, peaches, oranges and cream is followed by medium-bodied flavors of spice and fruit. The finish is snappy and clean. An interesting wine, though feels a bit discordant overall.
This is mostly Syrah, with a dash of Viognier blended in. It's dry, crisp and smooth, with some nice cherry fruit, but there's a green vegetal touch.
This blend of Touriga Nacional, Tinta Roriz, Alfrocheiro and Jaen is a satisfying melting pot of complex flavors. Its tannins are solid, although now complementing the rich berry fruits. It is an impressive wine that could still age further before complete maturity. Drink from 2019.
Light in color with notes of dusty plum, chocolate and spice. The palate is on the lighter side of medium bodied with abundant cherry flavors and chalky, firm tannins that need time to unwind. Best after 2016.
A ripe blend of Touriga Nacional and Castelão, the wine is balanced with considerable acidity from the Castelão and structure from the Touriga. It is only just beginning to mature while red berry and red currant fruit flavors still shine out. Drink now and until 2020.
A unique blend of fermenting orange, aging white flowers, dried apples and a musky sandalwood show on the nose of this wine. The palate is simultaneously rich, sour and creamy, with tangerine and banana flavors.
This is one of those awkward but deeply intellectual wines that won't appeal to everyone. Made near Gorizia, the wine shows a deep amber color with cloudy residue. Intense aromas focus on caramel, resin, candied orange peel, butterscotch and other resinous-oxidized smells. It's bold and thick and the finish is both sour and tannic. Despite it all, there's something special here.
Overtly herbal on the nose, green peppercorn, anise and tarragon mask aromas of underripe mixed berries. There's a decent weight to this wine—smooth and almost thick—yet the red-berry palate is overtaken by geranium and green-stem flavors.
Butter and honey make for a rich, hedonistic tone to this mildly structured white. A soft, malleable texture provides creaminess without complexity.
Cherry and raspberry aromas are accented by a spicy, earthy quality in this easy-drinking, well-balanced wine, and the flavors gush with fruit. It's smooth and polished on the palate, medium in body and light in tannin.

Modest green-apple fruit is married to earthy grapefruit and lime flavors in this effort by Channing Daughters winemaker Larry Perrine.

Is this a table or a dessert wine? Either way, the orange and apricot flavors are watery.
Tan in color, with musky aromas. Flavors of cucumber and citrus alert you to the fact that this is Sauvignon Blanc; because nothing else really does. Overall it's a foxy, musky wine without much SB character.
Here's a Brunello that opens with notes of black fruit, forest berry, cherry cola and exotic spice. This is a harmonious and traditional wine that reflects many of the elegant characteristics of the beautiful Tuscan territory that shaped it.
Crisp and clean, with lemon-lime and lychee aromas that are typical and well presented. There's body to the wine but also streamlining acidity, resulting in a slick, smooth mouthfeel. Flavors of green melon, citrus and lychee are fresh and positive.
Leathery, horsey lead aromas include hints of licorice, baked plum and green herbs. This Garnacha has a saucy, tomatoey feel and leafy red-berry flavors that finish with a hint of sweet caramel and herbal overtones.

Exotic fruit and herbaceous aromas lift out of the glass. On the bright, simple palate, zesty acidity underscores juicy pineapple and grapefruit notes.
This vineyard-designate sparkler shows enormous softness and creaminess, with plush aromas of peach, sweet grapefruit and sweet almond flower.
Citrus and white flowers comprise the nose, with a touch of melon underneath the top tier of scents. Flavors of orange, citrus pith and green herbs lead into a juicy finish that at first offers roasted nuts and then fades away smoothly. Its major fault is high acidity, which leaves a somewhat sour overall impression.
Deep, ripe, pure black fruit aromas feature leather and oak accents. The palate has a nice feel and good balance; it's tight, minerally and deals toasty berry, snappy pomegranate and chocolaty spice. Tight as a drum and long on the finish. Drinkable now but better down the road. 65% Garnacha with Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah.
Intense notes of white flower and lemon peel perfume this lovely aromatic white. Dry on the palate, with tart tangerine and lime flavors, it is marked by hints of blossom and zesty lime pith. Crisp and tonic on the finish. Drink now.
This full-bodied, generously oaked and caramel-laden wine starts to show overripe flavors and textures on the palate, becoming heavy on the finish.
Aromas suggesting rose water, leather, woodland berry, forest floor, cake spice and a balsamic note lead the way. The taut palate offers juicy black cherry, tart cranberry, baking spice and chopped herb alongside firm, polished tannins. A note of star anise closes the finish. Drink from 2018 through 2023.
A limited-production wine made to commemorate the Supreme Court ruling on marriage equality, this full-bodied vineyard-designated wine is softly layered in bold, rich huckleberry pie and strawberry flavors. Juicy on the palate, the fruit is seasoned with clove, cola and a hint of earth.
This firmly structured wine has a core of plum and black-cherry fruit enveloped in toasty oak. It's decidedly dry, and the full tannins may make it seem austere—it's rather Rhône-like for a California Syrah. Solid, if slightly reserved, this wine pairs well with grilled meat and other hearty foods now, but should reward cellaring for 3–4 years. Editors' Choice.
Fine and dry and crisp in mouthwatering acidity that brightens the lemongrass, gooseberry, vanilla and spice flavors. The tingly, secondary fermentation evident in June 2009 should settle out by Fall.
This is a sturdy, dry wine with hefty texture and straightforward, almost neutral flavors. It has an unusual salmon-amber color, light peach aromas and slightly earthy notes on the palate.
A very good wine while somehow failing to rise to expectations. Is it the vintage? All the elements are there, including ripe fruit flavors enriched with herbal and spicy complexities, generous acids and silky smooth tannins. Yet the wine is curiously New World flashy without offering nuance or depth.
This wine is big and classic in style, its intensity and caramel-like oak aromas leading into tarter lemon flavors and a stony freshness. Almond and hazelnut notes figure into the finish.
Barrel aromas are out front, with notes of char, toast and vanilla along with dark raspberry and spice. The palate presents a mixture of fruit and barrel, with the latter showing a bit too prominently.
Here's a modern Amarone that will appeal to those who like bold, chewy and slightly sweet red wines. Aromas include cinnamon, nutmeg, candied fruit and raspberry jam. This would be a good wine to pair with aged cheeses.
Tropical and slightly reduced, this complex wine from the famous Westside Road site is peachy and dripping in caramel. Baked apple adds to the lush, plush and richly robust palate, which finishes with balanced acidity and a taste of salty pretzel.
For a red wine from the Vinho Verde region, this is impressive. Serious wood aging hasn't dampened the red fruits and firm tannins. The wine is dry, solid and with final acidity. It should be drunk now.

This solid Bordeaux achieves a nice balance between ripe fruit and a more austere earthiness. There's a solid core of blackberry flavor and firm, broad tannins that suggest it will develop more depth with near-term cellaring.
This is a ripe, jammy red wine with sweet cherry aromas and plump background notes of blackberry preserve and exotic spice. It offers an easy, approachable personality, with a touch of chewy sweetness on the finish.
At first this seems sculpted in a feminine style, meaning elegant, graceful and light on its feet. It's a complete and satisfying wine, with strawberry, raspberry and cola flavors intertwined. Some tougher tannins show up in the finish, suggesting that a few more years of bottle age may add both length and further complexity.
This tight and steely wine is fresh with crisp fruits and a strongly herbaceous character. It offers gooseberry, grapefruit and intense, youthful acidity that needs to calm down. Give this very young wine until the end of 2016.
Apple and spice give this wine a bright as well as subtle character. Citrus acidity combines with a tangy, zesty texture. It still needs to age, so drink from 2015.
Bright and fresh, this is a totally fruity wine with a more serious edge at the end. Red cherries push through the crisp acidity that offers a zingy texture. The touch of minerality in the 40-year-old vines from the Chapoly vineyard granite soil gives an austere, structured aftertaste.
Aromas of ripe black currant, spice, pressed violet, scorched earth and a whiff of cedar emerge on this boldly structured red. The full-bodied palate delivers dried blackberry, raisin, licorice and chewing tobacco, accompanied by firm, chewy tannins. A black pepper note signals the close.

Rich, mountainous yet velvety, this affordable Cab offers boysenberry, blackberry and green pepper, and a whiff of baked bread. Perfect for filling people's glasses up at a party.

Warm and rubbery on the nose, with earthy aromas of blackberry, black cherry and freshly laid blacktop. The palate is full, tannic and grapey, with dark fruit flavors and an herbal element. Finishes short, herbal and salty, with lasting meatiness.
Bristling lime acidity and savory tones of herb and smoke contrast ripe tangerine and cantaloupe flavors in this dry single-vineyard Riesling. It's a concentrated, powerful wine, but feels tart and tight still, suggesting aging till at least 2016 would be best.
This bursts out of the chute in a blaze of fruit—pineapple, pear, green apple, even a trace of banana. Honestly, it's a bit disconcerting. But give it some time in the glass and it really changes, going from simply fruity to complex and minerally. Rather full-bodied for a Mosel wine; it does show a touch of alcohol warmth on the finish. Imported by Magellan Wine Imports.
Luminous and fresh, this is a classic Prosecco with all the lively effervescence and the cheerful personality you can expect from this popular Italian sparkler. It's creamy and smooth in the mouth and offers plenty of citric freshness. Cartizze is usually made in a Dry (or sweeter) style, yet this winemaker has opted for less residual sugar.
Showing the rustic power of Charbono, this is an inky dark, bone-dry, tannic wine, but California's sun stars in the immensely ripe black currant flavors. Crisp, bright acidity cuts through, making it a good partner for tomato sauce and cheese-based Italian fare. Should live for decades in a cool cellar, gradually softening and sweetening.

A blend of Chardonnay, Sauvignon, Ribolla Gialla, Malvasia and Picolit, this stunning wine offers enticing scents of wildflower, citrus and ripe orchard fruit. The radiant palate delivers white peach, lemon zest, yellow apple and mineral while bright acidity provides impeccable balance. Drink through 2020.
This varietal Marsanne has pretty almond and coffee liqueur aromas, and a palate rife with grassy, citrusy tones. It sounds disjointed but actually works quite well. Acidity is lively and would be razor sharp, were it not saved by a moderating minerally overlay. Worth seeking out.
Ripe butterscotch and a notable flank of big vanilla and oak greet the entry of this vineyard-designate. It makes for a luxurious wine reflective of a warm vintage and approach.
A Yalumba project, Running with Bulls sources Tempranillo from several subregions of the Barossa under the stewardship of winemaker Louisa Rose. The oak here is subtle and well integrated, adding hints of vanilla and spice to the black cherry and plum flavors. It's full-bodied and richly textured, yet soft and welcoming.
A fine effort, with an inviting swirl of earthy components. Citrus, spice, earth, compost, coffee grounds and cinnamon comprise this detailed, aromatic wine. It sits squarely in the classic mold of the better Walla Walla Syrahs.
Clean and well made, but underwhelming. There's basic blueberry and blackberry flavors riding on a medium-bodied palate, but overall the wine is more generic than specific. It's easygoing and causes no red flags to go up, however at the end of the day it doesn't show much personality.
Note the vintage—2009. This is already moving into maturity, loaded with berry-pie fruit flavors, especially blueberry. It's soft and drinking well, with cinnamon and baking spices in abundance. Don't delay—enjoy it over the next couple of years.
A blend of Cab Sauvignon and Franc, Merlot and Syrah from the makers of Firesteed wines. This clean, accessible Columbia Valley red wine includes mixed red and blue fruits, soft tannins and a medium to light palate weight. It's smooth and fruit-driven, with consistent follow-through flavors that are well integrated. The finish carries the slightest suggestion of oak.
Focus and precision describe this wine. Subtle aromas of grilled herbs and wood smoke precede dark flavors of just-ripe black cherries and blueberries. A sleek texture of firm tannins and refreshing acidity gives a lot of personality. It is medium to full bodied, and will only get better with time. Best after 2020.
The nose is still closed and gives away little. The palate has a voluptuous shape but comes tightly corseted: all is present but still closely held. The peachy fruit has a serene easy sweetness that has its perfect counter measure in orange and Meyer lemon freshness. This is poised and sweet but countered and cut by immense freshness. The aromas have yet to unfold fully. Both blood orange and peach lurk promisingly. It is the seamless poised texture of this late harvest that stands out, along with supreme purity. Wait for this. Drink 2020—2035.
This 100% varietal wine shows its warm-climate origins in the exceptionally ripe cherry, blackberry and dark chocolate flavors. It's also quite high in alcohol, which gives it some prickly heat as well as a raisiny, Port-like aftertaste.
Exuberant aromas of espresso, smoke and dark fruit leap up from the glass. The palate is considerably more reserved with fruit and earth flavors that linger.
This wine has mouth-puckering tannins that make it almost impenetrable. Its baked plum fruit meets a Dr. Pepper-type cola flavor.
Intense and concentrated with thick notes of all-fruit preserves, tree bark, cigar leaf and old campfire throughout the nose and mouth.

This captures the essential flavors of Washington Sauvignon Blanc. There are no aggressive grassy-herbal flavors, none of the vegetal or canned pea flavors that show up in other New World Sauv Blancs. Here it's all about clean melon and yellow fruit flavors, backed with bracing natural acids, round and ripe.
Rooty, spicy aromas of black plum are more complex than those of your average Malbec. In the mouth, this shows a heavy, almost reduced mouthfeel that could use more spring. Dark, heavily toasted baked-plum flavors finish peppery and brooding, but without much texture or presence. Drink soon.
This smells oddly like peanut butter mixed with lemon-lime. Citrusy, tangy acidity pushes lime, apple, pineapple and green-melon flavors toward a foamy, coarse, peanutty tasting finish.
A pretty copper-salmon color, this wine is dry and tart with acidity, but rich in feel. It's complex on the palate with flavors of citrus, peach, orange zest, vanilla and yeast. A minor detraction is the texture, which is a bit aggressive. Drink now.
This unusual blend has been a hit for Brander since its inception. The '07 is a rich wine, with high acidity and exotic tropical fruit, cherry, honey, vanilla cookie and spice flavors. Tasted in August, the wine had some effervescence, which should disappear by fall.
This is a thick, syrupy-rich wine that traffics in candied cherry and oak flavors.It has appeal but lacks varietal character.
Smells funky, with sweaty leather aromas, although you'll also find varietal notes of the grape. Tastes all right, with blackberries, currants, leather and mocha that are wrapped into firm tannins.

This is Bousquet's better 2006 Malbec because it doesn't have the heavy-handed oak of the Reserva. Here you get a ton of ripe, clean fruit with secondary leather and earth aromas. The palate is lively as it hits with firm blackberry and plum flavors. Not complex but good in its simplicity. Imported by North American Beverage Group.
Tastes pretty dry and tannic, with lots of astringency, and finishes hard and gritty. Not a wine you want to drink now. But there's a huge core of blackberries hidden below, accompanied by a burst of juicy acidity. Seems to have the balance for cellaring. The score reflects what this Cab will likely be in 6–8 years.
QED stands for Quod Erat Demonstrandum (what was to be shown). A further motto on the label reads “the proof is in the bottle.” This is supple, almost voluptuous, dark, sappy, packed with compressed black fruits, streaked with iodine and coffee. It shows excellent length and opens with scents hinting of game, earth, sweet mocha, lead pencil and cedar. Complex and intriguing, with six or eight year aging potential. A very impressive debut.
This is a delightful wine, crowd pleasing and complex. It benefits from its lack of oak by focusing on its lifted fruit—a twist of fresh-squeezed lemon and grapefruit—its acidity nicely measured and not one-dimensional. The crisp freshness is complemented by a hint of white rock and subtle lushness on the back palate.
Juicy blueberry and ripe blackberry dominate nose and palate on this easy-drinking, fresh-faced and fruit-forward red. The tannins are barely there and while the body boasts ample fruit, there is no heaviness. This is Zweigelt as it's meant to be: fun!
This wine has soft apple and ripe pear flavors. It has a smooth texture that means it is ready to drink. The aftertaste, with its crisper acidity, suggests a wine that will be a good apéritif.
Pungent and spicy, this has a scent that suggests it includes a fair amount of Riesling and perhaps some Muscat in the blend—the winery does not disclose the cuvée. It's medium-bodied, with a neutral palate of green apples and a whiff of orange liqueur.
As sweet as a dessert drink, with sugared pineapple juice, vanilla custard and spice flavors. Yet it's balanced with crisp acidity, and finishes clean. If this is your style, it's for you.
A burnt, stemmy nose is an indicator of what's to some. And while the palate has an o.k. feel to it, the flavors here are bitter, herbal and burnt. A wine that lacks freshness of fruit.
Dusty peach and nectarine aromas are subtle and draw you toward a balanced palate with modest weight and natural-feeling acidity. Peach, melon and quince flavors finish firm and elegant. This wine has a French character to it.
This Rosso shows nicely etched lines of wild berry, white almond and smoked spice. The wine is lean and crisp in the mouth and would pair well with a heaping plate of spaghetti and meat sauce.

The estate wine at Mapliers is rich, full-bodied and rounded. It has raspberry and apricot flavors that give it richness.

Full bodied and ripe, it has great fruitiness as well as a textured, steely character that provides both freshness and structure. A complex wine it has some aging potential, certainly until the end of 2014.
A blend of Malvasia, Greco and Grechetto, this fresh white delivers zesty acidity and lively notes of bitter almond, white flower, citrus and crushed mineral. It would pair beautifully with a heaping plate of spaghetti con le vongole.
An intriguing wine, this boasts herbal-, tobacco- and truffle-laced aromatics backed by a modicum of cassis fruit and a wonderfully soft, creamy, supple texture. The flavors also veer dangerously close to vegetal, so if you insist on no green notes in your Cab, search somewhere else.
Merlot and Nero d'Avola form the base for this easy red wine that would pair with fettuccine and meat sauce or pork roast. The quality of the fruit is clean, bright and sharp.
This rich blend of Trebbiano d'Abruzzo (70%), Passerina and Riesling offers a thick, creamy mouthfeel and plenty of melon, stone fruit and apricot. It might lack a bit of freshness and for that reason this white wine should be paired with a chicken or fish recipe that includes a zesty citrus component.
Notes of the garrigue abound on the nose, along with aromas of licorice, fennel seeds and raspberry. The palate offers more developed fruit flavors of juicy red plum and berries, followed by a lovely cocoa dusted finish.

Plump and round, with some residual sugar a distinct possibility, this wine boasts honey and melon flavors, accented with just enough tomato-leaf herbaceousness to maintain its varietal character. Drink now.

Full-bodied and delicious, this opens with aromas of red berry, rose, underbrush, kitchen spice and a balsamic note.

Hints of rock, tobacco and earth promise more flavor development over the next decade.

This is an attractive herbaceous wine that's light and tangy. Its gooseberry character dominates, lending acidity and a lively, crisp finish. The wine's blue bottle is memorable.
Lovely aromatics suggest wet stone, raspberry and pomegranate. This is a sleek, subtle wine. Its winery notes suggest it is a “slow bloomer” in the glass, which proves out if you give it that chance. It's balanced and resonant, with the promise of further improvement with another few years of bottle age.
Not exactly sleek but if you're O.K. with better than average size, sweetness and heat, it's more than fine. Aromas of sweet black plums are soft and stewy, yet the palate remains racy, with nervy cherry and raspberry flavors. A solid wine with just enough grit and bite. A Europvin, Christopher Cannan selection, Imported by multiple importers, including Michael Skurnik Wines.
From vines planted more than a century ago, this richly concentrated, voluptuous wine blossoms with time in the glass, revealing aromas of brandied black cherries and dark chocolate. The tannins are creamy smooth, the length on the palate prodigious. But at 15.5% alcohol, this wine's warmth is noticeable; opt for drinking it over the next 10 years.
Still tastes young and jammy, with cassis, blackberry and cocoa flavors wrapped in rich, thick tannins, and very dry. It's a pleasant wine without being spectacular, and I suspect it's at its best now.
Firm, with herbal flavors of olive and some interesting violet/floral highlights that carry into lightly plummy fruit and chocolate. After a promising start, the flavors quickly tail off, and the wine finishes smooth but muted.

A fat-feeling wine that has definite richness and sweet pear and apricot fruit flavors. It is ripe, full in the mouth, more of a food style.
The nose is a tease of subtle mandarin and lemon zest, promising but not giving away very much at all. The alluring juiciness of the palate hints at small, yellow mirabelle plums but as of yet merely plays at the surface.

The endless length reinforces that promise. Drink 2018–2025.
Soft and fruity, this easy-drinking, ripe wine has soft tannins, plenty of acidity from the red berry fruits, and a light-bodied character. Drink now, although it will be best from 2016.

Aromas offer raspberries, stemmy herbs, jalapeño and spice while the palate brings plush and lightly sweet cherry and blackberry flavors.
Complex and showing so much of what we love about Ribera del Duero. Baking spices, mature fruit and leather grace the stately bouquet, while the palate sings a pretty tune of berries, plum and brown sugar. There's thrust and potency to the mouthfeel but also a toasty, rich, mocha character. Drinking good now but should hold in there for another five to eight years.

This crisp, dry wine is full of bright red fruit and has a bite of attractive acidity. It refreshes with a lift of red currant fruit on the finish. Drink now.
With its earthy aromas and soft palate, this is a rustic wine, the sort designed for pairing with grilled meat. It has black plum flavors along with spice and bright red fruits. Drink now.
The fact that this variety is still in the ground in the county says something; the fact that's it's still in the confines of Pagani Ranch says even more. In this ode to generations gone by, the grower and winemaker find common ground in showcasing a big-bodied, black-purple expression of fig, plum and grippy leather that lands softly on the palate.
The subdued nose on this example will appeal to drinkers who avoid fruity, highly aromatic wines. The fairly concentrated palate, which shows some pleasant nutty notes, is slightly off-dry but the finish is crisp due to a good level of supporting acidity. Serve with baked or pan-seared fish.

Mostly Pinot Noir with some Chardonnay, this bubbly shows the pedigree of these two noble varieties in its balance and elegance.

Made from one of Port's best grapes, this wine is sweet and simple. It has sugary raspberry and vanilla flavors, with a sting of heat from high alcohol.
Difficult now for its extreme toughness. The wine is muted in aroma, except for new oak and a tease of blackberry, and hits the mouth with astringent tannins. The fruit seems too thin to age.
This bottling is still very young and will vastly improve with time, but already shows many of the components that make this remote mountain-surrounded vineyard one of the more exciting slices of the region.

Situated on one of the highest points of the Médoc, this vineyard is on deep gravel soil. It is one of a group of properties owned by the Chanfreau family of Château Fonréaud. This wine is firm and still young. However, it is already showing signs of the ripe black fruits and wood aging. Acidity and the firm structure will let the wine age. Drink from 2020.
Tastes overtly sweet in sugary cherry-raspberry jelly flavors. Everything else is good, including the acidity and rich oak, but that candied flavor is a turnoff.
Crisp acids and finely ground tannins give this young Cab great structure, making it feel balanced and elegant. It's also a very ripe wine, showing lush blackberry, cassis and cherry flavors. The wine is big enough to easily support its significant amount of flashy new oak. Drink now through 2010.
The nose is like a glass of fresh-poured Sprite but without the burning fizz. The palate has a cidery feel and direct flavors of lime, green apple and not fully ripe pineapple. Finishes a little pithy and bitter, with some of Torrontés' notorious burn. Good Torrontés for immediate drinking.

Too oaky, with vanilla cream and sweet butterscotch flavors dominating the underlying pineapples, apples and limes.
90-92. Barrel sample. Dense and concentrated, this is a massive wine that's packed with tannins.

A light style with crisp red currant flavors, acidity and a touch of minerality.
Like a textbook Loire white, it's minerally and crisp, with aromas of stone fruits, citrus and pink grapefruit. Not the deepest wine going, but what's here is solid. Look for stony flavors of grapefruit and orange, with a short, simple finish. Imported by House of Burgundy.
After initial scents of smoke and dark toast subside, the Ben's Blend reveals a prettier, daintier profile with vibrant red-cherry and plum notes laced with hints of cedar and purple flower.

Aromas of children's vitamins, corn stalk and white peach set up a lemony stony zesty palate with lemon and nectarine flavors. A stony crisp cleansing finish does the job while not faltering.
Tannins and structure bring out the character of the 2010 vintage in this open, generally soft wine. It is already attractive, drinkable and fresh. Black currants dominate the natural fruitiness. Drink now.
Another fine, food-friendly Sauvignon Blanc from Lake Sonoma. It's vibrant in mouthwatering acidity, with a clean, minerally scour that frames ripe flavors of lemons, limes, oranges and honey.
From a dependable producer and a fine vintage comes a problematic wine. The fruit is nicely ripe and suggestive of apples and peaches, and it's balanced and dry. Acidity is adequate. The only jarring note is a strongly toasted character, almost like charcoal, which you can both smell it and taste. Even the finish is marred by this burnt flavor.
With ripe flavors of black cherry, cola, licorice and sandalwood, this Merlot doesn't disappoint in the deliciousness department. It's soft on the finish, and ready to drink now.
Very easy, slightly confected cherry fruit comes immediately to the fore. The palate has the same candy-ish notion countered with lots of freshness. The body is light, translucent and off dry. Drink soon while berryish aromas are at their peak.
Ruddy, ripe yellow peach and deep mineral tones go hand and hand in this lush, full-bodied dry Riesling.

It's deftly balanced though, struck by reverberating notes of steel and slate that linger through a long finish.
Starts out with nice black cherry and cassis aromas before transitioning to roasted plum and prune flavors that come with sticky, fierce tannins and plenty of heat and grab. A very big and hard wine with midnight darkness but little subtlety. Finishes with sweet flavors of caramel and brown sugar.

Based on Cabernet Sauvignon, this Bordeaux blend remains tough and tannic at more than four years of age.

A limited-edition vintage that Perrier-Jouët releases for summer drinking. It has weight and richness with a soft, fruity dosage that gives touches of yeast and fragrant acidity.

Young and fragmented, this displays zigzag streaks of acid, purple plum, sour raspberry, citrus and wet rock. Time may well pull it together: at the moment it's a potpourri of not quite pulled together components.

Briny nectarine aromas set up a fresh palate. Standard stone-fruit flavors and apple notes finish steady and a touch sweet, with citric acidity.

A rewarding wine that isn't overly pricey or difficult to enjoy. Dark, lightly baked aromas hint at raisin and marshmallow, while the palate has a deep texture and vital acidity. Savory, tea-infused flavors bring pulse and kick, and as a whole it delivers a true reflection of what Ribera del Duero should be.
A very nice wine at a good price. Starts with a sweet fruit-oaky aroma that is warm and round. In the mouth it's soft and charming, with black-cherry and mocha flavors. Simple but satisfying, and a good value. Best Buy.
This is a pretty eastern U.S. Merlot, with its subtle, nuanced flavors of red berry, plum and currant and its approachable, soft tannins. Virginia is showing its talent for growing reds and this is a good example of what can be done with good vineyard management and winemaking.
A wine that certainly benefits from the warm 2009 vintage. The burnt wood flavors are too prominent for the cherry fruits. Perhaps in a year it will be better integrated.
A pretty Cab, easy to drink with its softly ripe tannins and pleasant currant and cherry flavors that are well-oaked. There's a slight problem with a sweaty smell.
A feral, oaky Pinot Noir from cool-climate vineyards that tastes of just-ripe cherry and raspberry fruit, with a distinct smokiness on the nose.

There's a slightly eccentric nose to this Moldovan SB, with its baked vanilla and floral notes, and on the palate, the wine is a bit overwrought and grapy. But despite these hiccups, the wine offers overall refreshing citrus flavors and a nice spin of spice.

Tropical fruit, aromatic herb and tomato vine scents jump out of the glass. The palate is focused, albeit a bit lean, offering green melon and white grapefruit flavors, with crisp acidity.

Bone dry, but sharp and harsh in texture, with some minty flavors next to the black cherries. Okay for an everyday sipper with casual foods.
There's not a great quantity of Pinot Noir in Long Island, but McCall's is consistently one of the region's best producers of it. The Hillside Corchaug Estate is particularly refined, offering loads of ripe cherry and berry flavors calibrated neatly by zesty acidity and savory herb and smoke notes. It's supple and mouth-filling, finishing on a long, delicately tannic note. Drinks well now but should hold nicely through 2025.
This structured wine still has wood aromas although on the palate the rich, dark fruits dominate. The tannins both from wood and from the fruit are firm and still young, showing the possibility of long-term aging. This complex wine should not be drunk before 2019.

Salmon colored, with light melon and almond aromas that are hardly distinct but by the same token are nice enough. Sweet and simple in the mouth, with no discernible fruit flavor to latch onto. Imported by Broadbent Selections, Inc.
Sangiovese (75%) and Merlot make for a plain and simple red blend with wild berry and fresh blueberry aromas. Beyond those notes, the wine is short lived and fresh.
An awkward Pinot, soft and sweet in raspberry fig Newton cookie and Dr. Pepper cola flavors. The alcohol is pretty high, and shows in the form of heat. Lacks the delicacy you expect from this fine vineyard.
The Eichberg vineyard, one of the driest in Alsace, is on a gentle southeast-facing slope. This Gewurztraminer shows the opulent style of wines that are typically produced. It is rich and generous, developing cinnamon and nutmeg flavors balanced by superripe tropical fruits. It still has a way to go, so drink from 2017.

Blue Fish's Original Riesling is a medium-bodied, off-dry wine in modern packaging. It's broader and less acidic than most Pfalz Rieslings, coating the mouth with hints of vegetable oil and citrus, then falls away quickly on the finish.
Imagine a Sauvignon Blanc with the weight of Chardonnay, and that's what you get with this single-vineyard wine. It's amazing, because the wine never saw oak. Still, it has a vanilla richness on top of pineapple, peach, anise and honeysuckle flavors. Maybe the correct comparison is of a white Cabernet Sauvignon, with the complexity that implies. What a great value.
You cannot help but love the luscious nose of this beautiful wine. Cerequio opens with inviting aromas of dark chocolate, creamy vanilla, spice and bright fruit.

Just beautiful to drink now and for the next 3–4 years.

Although the nose isn't very expressive, the palate offers up ripe sour cherry, black pepper, sage and licorice alongside bracing tannins. Young and aggressive, this needs time. Drink after 2018.

This “classico” interpretation of Nero d'Avola and Frappato from COS is every bit as enjoyable as the producer's top-shelf Pithos expression. You'll get pretty spice tones backed by elegant fruit and almond. Pair it with light meat dishes and serve it a few degrees cooler than you normally would a red wine.
Dried apricot, lemon zest and flower notes lead the nose. Flavors of fresh white fruit and citrus are laced with a chalky bite, giving the wine focus and an elegant edge. A classy white for everyday sipping.

This is an elegant and refined Barolo with focused aromas of black fruit, drying mineral and root beer. There's also a playful side that emerges thanks to the wine's ripe and plush mouthfeel. Sure, it's a structured, tannic wine but its fine texture helps make it approachable within the next five years or so.
Unctuous and earthy, this medium-bodied wine is more about subtle and savory herb notes than deep fruit. With its light fruit characteristics and bold spice elements, it will make a versatile choice for the table.
Overtly sweet in cola, chocolate, black cherry purée, glycerine and sandalwood flavors. The sweetness could also be from high alcohol, as the mouthfeel is hot. Drink now.

This seems sweet like a Port. It tastes like raspberry and cherry jam, with lots of heat from the alcohol.
Sweet, rich orange marmalade flavors, maybe not as imposingly powerful as Guiraud can be, but still with a great inner tension between sweetness and dry botrytis, precede a delicious addition of lemon zest and a final burst of sweetness balanced with acidity.
Estate grown, this wine offers a density of blueberry and clove aromatically and in terms of flavor. It also has a tightness of tannin and rustic elements of dried herb and leather. Powerfully concentrated, the floral aromatics are hidden somewhat by the richness of the fruit.
This opens with aromas of ripe black plum, underbrush and a whiff of cassis. On the concentrated palate, notes of tobacco, mint and thyme accent a black cherry core while polished tannins provide the framework. Drink 2018–2024.
A classic Napa Cab from this great vintage. Mesmerizes with new oak, blackcurrant and cassis aromas, and the first sip explodes with blackberries, cherries and vanilla. The tannins are fine, soft, ripe and sweet. Completely satisfying all the way.
A new price point tier for K-J, in between Grand Reserve and Highlands Estates. Bright and racy in cool-climate acidity, with layered flavors of lemondrop candy, lemon chiffon pie and buttered toast. Delicious and savory. The grapes are from the Santa Maria Valley and the Los Alamos region.
The melon and apple aromas are slightly dull but harmless. It feels decent, with orange and green-herb flavors. The finish is citric and green.
This 125-acre vineyard in the hills to the north of Aix-en-Provence has 24 acres dedicated solely to this rosé. It is delicious, fruity, and just right in its light tang of minerality that makes it both structured and refreshing, with a ripe yellow fruit aftertaste.
Peach and white-flower aromas forecast a fleshy, soft palate. Papaya and melon flavors are honeyed, but this finishes bland, with a vanilla note.
In the spirit that Tejo can grow anything on its fertile soil, this wine is a rounded tropical-fruit-flavored Sauvignon Blanc. It has acidity enough as well as a warm smooth character. It is certainly ready to drink.

Thick and brawny, this Sicilian Shiraz boasts a deep purple hue and presents in-your-face aromas of prune, cedar, blueberry and white peppercorn. The consistency is chunky and chewy, like play dough, but drying mineral tones help cap those jammy fruit flavors.
A young wine from a high-acid year, and it's showing a fair amount of earth and green, herbal flavor. The fruit seems just on the edge of ripe, with hints of brambly berry. Well balanced in a tough year.

This is great bargain for a white wine this stylish and tasty. A blend of five varieties, it's rich and ripe with flavors of tangerine, stonefruit, lime, vanilla, cream and honey, accented with crisp acidity. They all come together into a seamless, easy-drinking and slightly sweet sipper.
Lean and easy, this has bright peach, apricot and lemon-lime aromas. A bright note of tangerine skin appears on the finish.
Mildly sharp and herbal smelling, with olive, plum and leather aromas. Healthy in the mouth, maybe a touch needle-like, but overall the wine's dry red fruit, pepper and herbal accents seem right for the category it's playing in. Good for under $10.
Fairly full-bodied and lush, with berry fruit flavors balanced by darker notes of chocolate and coffee. The tannins are soft, making this wine immediately accessible.
Despite ripe flavors of blackcurrants, cocoa and spice and a sweet veneer of oak, this wine needs more acidity to perk it up. It's soft to the point of melting, and finishes thin. Good, but disappointing.
A brick-like tint and dry dusty spicy aromas of dried red fruits and tomato form the opening of this Tannat-Cab Franc blend. Despite medium acidity, this comes across as creamy. Flavors of caramel and saucy red fruits finish soft and a touch flat. Drink through 2019.
This is a lovely, full-bodied expression of apple blossom aromas, just-ripe pear and orange Creamsicle, a balanced mix of rich and sublime that remains smooth and silky on the palate with a lingering finish.

The aroma is deep and inviting, equal parts new oak, Cabernet fruit and dried herbs. Has tremendous weight, with red and black cherry, cola, chocolate, cassis and roasted coconut flavors. Brilliant now, virtually flawless and totally delicious, yet has the impeccable balance to age and even improve over the years. The listed price is its pre-release price. Drink now through at least 2020.
Light citrus, grapefruit and oak notes are nice openers. Peach, melon and other fruits grace the palate. Shows crispness in addition to oak, and the finish is lasting and round. Easy to get; pretty solid overall.

Delicate and elegant with a wide array of small berry aromas, Volpaia offers an immensely food-friendly wine that reflects the traditions of Chianti Classico.

Very rich and oaky, with bigtime flavors of grilled pineapples and peaches, pears, buttered toast and oak spices. Only 250 cases produced.

The flavors are an excellent balance of minerality and fruit, with a rich, round but delicate overall character that's intriguing and unfolds on the tongue. The finish is clean and cool. A versatile, sophisticated white.
This was the last vintage at Clos Fourtet under the ownership of the Lurtons. They made fine wine, but the potential of the property was never quite realized. The wine just fails to excite: it is rich and concentrated with ripe tannins and some sweetness, but at the same time, there is a layer of acidity and structure which gives the wine a firm, solid shape.
Sheldon's Roma's Vineyard Pinot Noir is exquisite. Very light in color (and alcohol level at 12.9 percent), it opens with gorgeous raspberry and violet aromas. Fully satisfying from start to finish, it has a lush mouthfeel, cherry spice high tones and a long, easy finish that will tempt you to want more. This is a beautiful wine. Only 60 cases made.
This winery is striving to show that Burgundian varietals can work in the cooler Willow Creek region of Paso Robles, where sea breeze comes through the Templeton Gap. This bottling provides good evidence, with aromas of crushed rocks, vanilla toast, roasted apple and peach. Brisk apple cider dominates the palate, picking up roasted almonds in the midpalate and possessing quite a bit of pear skin grip.
Rich and packed with spicy tropical fruit. New oak imparts smoke and vanilla notes. The texture is creamy and smooth, kind of custardy, with high acidity that makes it drink whistle-clean. A very nice wine.
This smooth, layered wine is medium bodied, well balanced and rich, with soft tannins to give it heft. Flavors run to black cherry, clove and cinnamon. The great sense of polish and composure make it a pleasure to drink.
Tannic astringency marks this Cabernet, even though it's more than seven years old. It feels hard and unrelieved in the mouth, although there's enough blackberry, cherry and cassis flavor to satisfy. The question is whether or not continued aging will eventually bring this tough, aggressive wine around. Try after 2013.
While this shows the ripeness of the vintage, it remains very minerally in style, with a lemony crispness to match with its white fruit flavor, tight texture and taut finish.
While this smells almost entirely like a barrel, the palate avoids being resiny and instead comes across as fresh and balanced. Oaky flavors are unavoidable, while melony fruit notes on the finish are dosed up with wood spice and a shot of freshening acidity.
Lots to like about this Zin. It's dry, smooth in tannins and fine in acidity, and shows the briary, brambly, wild berry notes of its origin. It's a little thin in flavor and depth, especially at this price. Still, it's a very nice Zinfandel.
Round and easy on the palate, this wine combines 61% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot, 10% Cabernet Franc and 4% Petit Verdot. Approachable dark fruit meets touches of leather and garrigue. It's a full-bodied and concentrated wine that's still developing in the bottle.
Supple and rich, this medium-bodied wine is slightly sweet, blending berry and cherry flavors with milk-chocolate accents. The sweetness softens the texture and makes it feel broad and mouth-filling.
A rounded, mouthfilling wine. At the beginning, it seems very soft, but then it is possible to discern rich tannins through the concentrated red fruits and black plums. The acidity is there all the time, a fine counterpoint to the seductive, rich fruits and dry tannins.
This wine seems to have evolved quickly, going from dark and sturdily tannic in June to more perfumed and lighter-bodied in August. I'm happy to report that the changes have been largely for the better, although I have mild concerns about the wine's potential longevity. It now has a bouquet of fresh flowers, herbs and flavors to match. Harmoniously blends amounts of florality, meatiness, spice and fruit. Drink now–2010.
Smoky bacon and a bittersweet element of black tea make for an exotically spicy, complex and full-bodied wine from the mighty vineyard site overlooking the Petaluma Gap. Black cherry, pomegranate and cardamom are wrapped in a swaddling of toasted oak, while the mouthfeel is dense and concentrated.

Aromas of tilled soil, herbs, flowers, olive, black pepper and orange peel lead to fresh, elegant smoked meat flavors with spot on balance. It's a unique expression of the variety from the state that keeps you coming back for more.
An eccentric, although likeable, Cab. It shows the dryness and tannic astringency that Atlas Peak Cabs are famous for, along with upfront, accessibly New World flavors of cherry jam, black currants and cedar. Hard to know if it's an ager, but it's a pretty good wine.
Merryvale's Profile remains a star year after year. The '04 is nearly all Cabernet Sauvignon, and stuns with its power. With a smooth, complex tannin structure, it's rich in currants, blackberries and cedar, but is too young to open now. Should hit its stride around 2010 and continue to develop for some years after. Tasted twice, with consistent results.
Blackberry and cassis aromas share the bouquet with tougher, more masculine notes of earth, rubber and char. Once it opens on the palate, there's ripe raspberry, plum and a nod to the black side of the fruit spectrum. Finishes with a mild kick of tannins and the essence of coffee and pepper. A solid blend of Cabernet and Merlot from the improving Uco Valley.
A hint of green-floral perfume wafts amidst notes of honey and apple on this off-dry Riesling. Spine-tingling with acidity, it's balanced with sweet yellow peach and cherry flavors. Irresistibly easy drinking, it finishes moderately long.
Aromas of rose, forest floor, toast and dark berry lead the nose on this straightforward, vibrant red. The racy palate delivers tart cherry, fresh raspberry, white pepper and clove alongside brisk acidity. Drink through 2016.
Closed in character, it has power and density as well as the potential of great fruitiness. A creamy texture with a rich feel offers suggestions of yellow fruits as well as apple. Drink from 2016.
Creamy, rich and sun-drenched Tuscan fruit always makes this Grigio stand out in a crowd. The differences between this and cooler-climate wines include generous summertime aromas such as yellow rose, ripe melon, tropical fruit, jasmine and a fuller body. But you forego that extra crispness of northern regions. Imported by Banfi Vintners.
This wine is soft and fruity with ripe berry fruits and gentle tannins. For a major second wine, it's surprisingly easy and soft, developing fast with its berry fruits, chocolate and wood flavors at the end. Drink from 2017.
Lychee and lime are the lead aromas on this good Torrontés from Salta. The palate shows bright, piercing acids and a narrow, citrus profile; flavors of orange and grapefruit follow suit. Citrusy on the finish, with ample roundness.
This elegant wine is dry, balanced in alcohol and classically proportioned. Full-bodied flavors of blackberries, currants and plums lead to a spicy finish. Rich and complex, it shows heightened structure, courtesy perhaps of its Yountville origin. Drink now–2016.
Not quite as impressive as some other vintages, the 2002 Print Shiraz boasts plenty of color but lacks some nuance and freshness. Aromas of baking spices are tinged with coffee, anise and dates, while the flavors of dried fruit and chocolate dominate the palate. It's big and mouthfilling, with 15% alcohol.
Black cherry fruit is encased in dark barrel flavors of smoke, charcoal and espresso. Tart acids tighten up the finish. It's got plenty of power, but the fruit seems over-matched by the oak, at least at this young stage.
The mouthfeel on this 100% Cabernet is tough in tannins, with an astringent, sandpapery feeling. Still, it's dry and balanced, with a rich vein of blackberries, black currants and herbs, accented with spicy, 50% new French oak. Give it a good decant before drinking.

Earthy slightly grassy infusions work their way onto a hot energetic bouquet. This feels racy, drawing and a bit clampy, while woody spicy flavors of rubbery berry fruits finish bold and hot like the beginning.
This is a blend of vineyards from which the winery sources its fruit. It's a very good wine, dry and crisp, with ripe flavors of cherries, raspberries, root beer and herbs. The texture is silky, the balance impeccable, but it's a tad thin in the midpalate.
A nose of tart cherry, tomato leaf and Mediterranean herbs primes the palate for flavors of cherry, cranberry, green olive and thyme with a trace of eucalyptus. Although at first the tannins can be a bit gum-numbing, as the chewy quality recedes there is a nice play between brightness and rich texture.
This expression of Bardolino really hits all the right marks. The wine is intense and polished with vibrant aromas that recall a wild assortment of forest berries. It is smooth and supple in texture and there's a very cleaning, fresh note at the close that invites glass after glass.
A whole lot of oak and nuts hit you on the nose, but underneath there's good apple and melon aromas. The palate remains highly oak-infused, with wood at every corner. Finally, however, the wood fades, revealing heady pear, melon and pineapple. A big wine with some awkwardness. Imported by Vintus LLC.
A soft, gently fruity wine, it has warm tannins, layers of smooth vanilla from wood aging and a finish that brings out the acidity of the vintage. Fresh, fruity and ready to drink.
The best thing about this fine young white wine is the acidity. It's high and crisp and bracing, and makes the peach pie, honeysuckle and vanilla wafer flavors come alive. There's a honeyed sweetness, but that wonderful acidity balances it nicely.

Jammy blackberry and plum aromas come with hints of Band-Aid and iodine. This is big and broad on the tongue, but also a little flabby. Flavors of prune, oak, blackberry and licorice finish without much drive.
On the austere side, this shows more tannin than fruit, based around a dry core that has spread through the wine. There is some black plum skin and black currant fruit, but it is hard to find.
Why, at the northern limits of Burgundy, there should be a small village producing Sauvignon Blanc is a curiosity, as the name of the wine suggests. This ripe, tropical fruit and crisp green plum-flavored wine is tightly textured and ready to drink.
An intensely sweet wine with layers of dry spice that give it balance. From the rich, fertile Goldert vineyard. This soil character gives it a richness and ripeness already, at this early stage in its development. Still the wine is structured and should age well over 10 years.

Light and fruity, this has a yeasty edge along with acidity. On the palate, there are lots of green fruits, offering a dancing, lively character. At the end, there is a touch of vanilla.
87-89 Barrel sample. Good structure, attractive smoky fruit with bright acidity, over solid firm tannins.
Medicinal, herbal aromas give hardly a hint of the focused dry, tannic structure of this wine in the mouth. This is solid, chewy, but the tannins are equalled by the weight of concentrated black fruit. Definitely for aging.
This is good week-day Chardonnay with buttered toast, orange jam and vanilla flavors. The acidity gives it a clean, vibrant finish.
Here's a textbook Greco di Tufo that opens with delicate but alluring scents of ripe orchard fruit, orange blossom and a whiff of toasted almond. The crisp yet creamy palate doles out ripe pear, peach and citrus while bright acidity lifts the finish. It closes on a mineral note.
Boasts fascinating aromas of caramel, soy sauce and meats, with only a small dash of strawberries. This is an assertively flavored Champagne that would shine with game or red meats; it’s not a great sipper on its own.
This is a lovely Sauvignon Blanc that shows enough elegance and finesse to serve with fine food. It's dry and crisp, with citrus, lemongrass, gooseberry and mineral flavors. Nice with tempura appetizers.
Superbly warm weather in 2015 gave an extra boost of sunshine to many of the Mosel's entry-level wines, and the RK is one of the best. Whiffs of freesia and tangerine peel waft from the glasss of this semidry Riesling. It's low in alcohol, yet so honeyed and ripe that flavors of grapefruit and peach seem to slick sumptuously on the palate. Zesty lime acidity freshens a lingering finish.
This classy Walla Walla Syrah is still young and tightly wound, with juicy acids and flavors of tart berry and wild mountain fruit. As it opens in the glass it starts to show smoked ham and bacon, with black pepper in the back. Tannins are chewy and right on the border between green and black tea, but the bright raspberry fruit shines through. It's got good, crunchy structure and a substantial finish.
Surprisingly full bodied and rich for a wine at this price, the 2007 Catapult is at the same time savory in style, with notes of dry cedar, roasted meat, black olive, cracked pepper and fine espresso. Finishes long, with velvety tannins. Best with herbed lamb, simply grilled or roasted. Drink now–2020.

This light-bodied wine is quite dry and nervy with acidity. Its fresh red cherry and cranberry flavors follow floral and black cherry aromas. Smoky-earthy complexity adds interest to its elegant personality.
This wine is a butterball—even though unoaked—from the butter and almond aromas, to the butterscotch flavors and rich texture. It feels full bodied, not overtly fruity, and does bring tasty acidity to the flavors and on the finish.
A soft, well-integrated mountain Zin gifted in sweet raspberry and leather, balanced completely between juicy and savory. The finish lingers for a long time, and the wine's acidity accommodates a range of foods, from the expected barbecue and other grilled meats to risotto or gourmet pizza.
The style at Martinborough Vineyards has always been geared toward aging, and this 2011 is still remarkably fresh. Floral and cherry notes lead the way, backed by tart acids and firm tannins. Worth stashing away until 2018.

The vivid freshness and tangy texture sets it apart from the crowd, and it will work wonderfully with foods from raw oysters to roast chicken.
The nose on this regularly solid Verdejo is mild, with aromas of apple, pear and melon. The palate is round and a touch fleshy, with modest acidity pushing pithy peach and pear flavors. The finish tastes of almond skins and apple.

Dry, leathery, slightly nutty aromas are more earthy than fruity. This mature Rioja is fresh and light on the palate, with leafy, spicy flavors of plum, tobacco and wood grain. Spicy berry and cocoa flavors grace a fading finish. Drink now.
A tight, juicy wine, with powerful new wood aromas and flavors. The tannins are taut, dense, with a steely mineral edge, cranberry skin structure, followed by bright acidity. Like other Alvaro Castro wines, this needs time to age.

A little heavy and soft, with jelled raspberry, cola and vanilla flavors. The finish turns sugary.
Overpowering in feline aromas and flavors that obscure the underlying citrus and lemongrass. Just too unripe to earn a higher score.

A delightfully light, crisp and well-rounded expression of the variety—aged in stainless steel—this has a beginning, middle and end, all well defined.

With a light, smooth texture and nicely jammy fruit character, this wine delivers good flavor impact and a generous mouthfeel.

Kiona's ice wines are legendary, and this latest is as excellent as any they've done. Butterscotch scents invite further exploration. As the wine coats the mouth, it comes into lush focus with brown sugar, molasses, vanilla, cooked banana and more butterscotch. It's low in alcohol, but maintains sufficient acidity to stay buoyant and lively. Residual sugar is a hefty 170 g/L.
Underbrush, tobacco, new leather, crushed herb and a whiff of mature plum lead the way. The juicy full-bodied palate is still young and taut, evoking ripe black cherry, crushed raspberry, licorice, clove and a hint of coffee. A backbone of youthfully austere fine-grained tannins and bright acidity gives it an age-worthy structure and balance. Drink 2020–2032.

Two characteristics make this wine outstanding. One is the sheer richness of flavor—waves of raspberries, cherries, chocolate, bacon and sandalwood that flood the palate. The other factor is the texture, which is soft and velvety. It's an accomplished blend of Petite Sirah, Grenache, Syrah and Zinfandel from Paso Robles.
Green aromas dominate the underlying strawberry scents. In the mouth, it's raw and acidic. As a result, the flavors are sour and the feel is scratchy.
The tannins set the scene with their firm character and solid structure. Licorice and bitter coffee flavors follow, and only then do the fruits come in. Black cherries are firm and ripe, with black plum skin texture. The wine is very concentrated and powerful. Give it four years or more.
Nicely dry in the finish, with a good bite of acidity and smooth tannins. The weakness is a certain thinness of blackberry fruit. For the price, though, you get some elegance.

Tight, mineral and closed, packed with dark tannins. The fruit lies behind all this texture, leaving an impression of toughness, the acidity dominant.

Deep gold in color, this vineyard designate is oaky, with gingerbread, caramel and canned pineapple flavors. It's full, unctuous and creamy on the palate.
If the term “mellow” were to be made into a liquid this would be it. Both nose and palate have the sonorous gentle richness of very ripe pear, with the richness of some dried pear fruit, too. This late-harvest style has sweet richness but is also utterly balanced. There is enough freshness and structure to corral the fruit into something easy, gentle, generous and warming. This is so unobtrusive, so balanced that it might disappear very quickly.
Violet, scorched soil, spice and mature berry aromas lead the nose. The medium-bodied, elegant palate delivers mature black cherry, crushed raspberry, freshly ground clove and black pepper. Firm but fine-grained tannins provide support.
Typically Meursault with its fat fruit and texture, this is a wine that doesn't yet quite integrate. The problem is the excessive wood, which dominates the fruit, and gives tense acidity to the wine. It leaves intense spiciness, burnt toast flavors and a bitter, grapefruit flavor on the finish. Maybe in a few years.
Stalky smoky aromas open a wine that is spicy, smoky from wood and full of red fruits. The wine is light with acidity as well as a layer of crisp tannins. Drink this from 2018.

Full-bodied and deliciously supple, with layers of black cherries, plum, tea and exotic spices that gently caress the palate. Long and silky on the finish, making it approachable now, but it should only improve over the next several years. Imported by Vintus LLC.
Mumm makes a mighty fine mid-priced bottle, with plenty of toasty flavor to lift it into an orbit close to where the big boys fly. The fruit is on the lighter side, but crisply defined, and it segues into the round, satisfying flavors of older, more mature Champagne. The bubbles are gentle and petite, and the flavors linger elegantly all around the tongue.
The plush-feeling plum and blue fruit flavors provide much of the appeal on this pleasant, easy-drinking wine. Aromas of tar and berry provide accents.

This oak-aged Chardonnay from Piedmont in northern Italy offers an intense bouquet of yellow fruit, lemon soda and ground clove. Those wood influences also appear in the mouth, where the wine shows a creamy, rich texture.
In 2014 this vineyard designate has been further subdivided by clone. The Dijon 115 bottling brings a burst of fresh raspberry fruit, detailed and perfectly set against balancing acidity.

Made with 88% Sangiovese, 10% Merlot and 2% Alicante, this opens with whiffs of violet and tilled earth. The simple palate offers red cherry and clove alongside soft tannins. Enjoy soon.
Dense and concentrated on the nose, this features blackberry and black cherry aromas, with hardly any perceptible oak. It feels fresh but choppy and tannic, with roasted plum, berry and savory spice flavors. It's baked in flavor and gritty in feel as it finishes.
Ripe, full bodied and jammy, this wine is already a delight to the senses. It is rich, round and full of strawberry jelly flavor, layered with new-wood-derived spice. The wood element needs to become integrated, so keep this powerful bottling for at least five years.
This is from a block of younger vines made from Dijon clones within the larger Arrendell Vineyard. The wine is quite full-bodied and robust, almost rustic, which is mainly due to the powerful, young tannins. With explosive berry, currant and mocha flavors, this powerful wine should hit its stride in mid-2010.
The richest wine in the Pellé range, full of super-ripe fruits with great maturity. The wine concentrates on mango and pineapple along with some fine, linear citrus acidity. Worth aging for 1–2 years.
The 10% Pinot Noir in this otherwise Chardonnay-dominant blend adds an attractive, light pink color. It is crisp and fragrant. Pinot Noir's tannins barely show, while Chardonnay's apple-driven acidity comes through strongly.
Aromas of ripe green apple, pear, Spanish broom and tangerine lead to a creamy palate of yellow stone fruit and a hint of white almond. Fresh acidity and a mineral note brighten the finish.
This is a dark, big, deeply flavored Cabernet whose tannic structure strongly suggests mid- to long-term aging. Bone dry, it has flashy flavors of black currants, dark chocolate and cedar. Very fine. Best 2010–2015, if not longer in a proper cellar.
Remarkable power and intensity characterizes this ripe, honeyed wine. Off-dry in style, it's round and rich on the palate with loads of luscious peach and apricot flavors, yet nuanced with layers of white blossoms, lavender and spice. Thoroughly enjoyable now for its floral, fruity exuberance, it's structured enough to develop well through 2019.
An easy-drinking Shiraz, with crisp, well-defined blueberry fruit, a smear of chocolate and a twist of cracked pepper. Not much in the way of tannin, so drink now.
This wine might be starting to fade already, as its citrus and nectarine flavors seem to be lacking just a bit in vibrance and intensity. Good, but drink up—or look for the 2007.
Bravo Giacomo Neri! This wine raises the bar on modern Brunello and offers a peek view into the future and potential of this incredibly expressive wine. Super concentrated and intense, whiffs of roasted espresso bean, tannery, summer-ripe black cherries, and porcini mushrooms peel back layer after layer. A firmly tannic touch is there to remind you to drink this wine anytime after ten years. Imported by William Grant & Sons, Inc.
This wine is a big one, going all out to make friends. New-oak aromas like clove, cedar and cinnamon explode out of the glass, then flavors of dark chocolate and cherry spread across the palate for a generous—almost thick—impression. Fine layers of tannins and firm acidity blanket the texture.
This is a full, opulent wine that is delicious with acidity and spice. Fragrant grapefruit and citrus notes complement rich apple flavors on the palate. The wine has many years to age and achieve balance between its structure and fruitiness. Drink from 2015.
From an estate-farmed property in the Russian River, this otherwise Carneros-based producer shows it can handle different conditions with aplomb, taking its foot off the pedal a touch in terms of power and concentration in this wine. Floral, soft and silky, it remains complex in red and black berry, with handfuls of truffled earth.
This blend of five different grape varieties yields by its very nature nonspecific fruit character, but it is ripe and round, honeyed and spicy on the finish. Drink now.
One of the drier, crisper white Rhône-style wines out there, and hence one of the best. These Viognier, Grenache Blanc and Marsanne blends tend to be too sweet, but this one's firm and minerally. Brisk acidity highlights zesty lime, pear and white flower notes.
The herbal, thin fruit is covered with a strong streak of vanilla. It finishes with bitter tannins.
This is soft and fruity, with attractive acidity that cuts into the smooth texture. It does have a nutty, bitter character that shows through, giving a hard edge to the otherwise fruity wine.

This bracing, precisely crafted wine emphasizes crispness and attractively lean fruit flavors over richness, and it will be great with appetizers and seafood, even raw oysters. It's fresh, clean and inviting.
Dramatic Cabernet Sauvignon, very dark in color and utterly ripe and balanced to the taste. Shows an enormity of blackberries, cherries and milk chocolate, made firm and grounded by grippy tannins. Made solidly in the modern cult style and thus appealing now for its sheer deliciousness.
A little harsh and irregular in tannins, with strong, ripe flavors of cherry and raspberry jam that finish sweet. It's a rustic wine for drinking with easy fare.
This Chardonnay is soft and tasty, with orange, pineapple, apricot and vanilla flavors. Drink now.
Green and raisiny at the same time, which isn't a good combination. The wine seems ultra ripe and lacking in red fruit, acids and other balancing elements. Harvested too late? Regardless, it isn't working.
The winery has been quietly building up a solid track record with this bottling, and with the 2009, they've produced their best yet. The wine is gigantic in every respect. Vast, deep flavors of roasted coffee bean, blackberry, currant, violets and dark chocolate are complex, with plenty of toasted oak in the bargain. The tannins are strong, strong, strong, numbing the palate. While nobody can assure you it has a longterm future, this should evolve nicely with time; drink through 2022.

Clove, star anise and deep strokes of red cherry show on the nose of this bottling from one of the estate's best blocks. The palate is redolent with bay leaf and eucalyptus, which give depth to the red-cherry, cranberry and tart pomegranate flavors.
Quite intense, with blasting aromas of blackberry, coconut, cocoa and even leather and horse hide. It's 65% Tannat and 35% Malbec, and as a whole it's big, grabby, tight and full of blackberry and raspberry flavors that bring an herbal twist. Smoky and herbal on the finish.
This is one of those Petite Sirahs that will benefit from a little time in the cellar. Even though it's made in the modern style, with softer, sweeter tannins than the variety has shown the past, it's still a bruiser. Yet with a gigantic core of blackberries, blueberries and chocolate, it should negotiate the next 5–6 years easily.
From cool, high-altitude vines, this Riesling is aromatic and crisp with a hint of steel and plenty of freshness. Acidity cuts through this already delicious, very fruity wine that is about to move to maturity. Drink now.
This is a good example of Long Island Riesling from a producer who has a true historic stake in the region. Crisp, lively flavors of apple and melon mingled with a refreshing touch of minerality are light but substantial, and the finish is long and full of fruit flavors. A friendly Riesling that will hold its own against myriad dishes or is is great in the glass alone.
Opaque in color and superrich on the nose, it has dominant aromas of earth, leather, baked fruit and spice. It feels lush and chunky, maybe a touch soft, with earthy, naturally herbal flavors of dark fruit, plum and chocolate. The finish is smooth and warming.
Here's an exciting dessert wine that opens with an intense fragrance of mint, thyme and berry. The concentrated palate offers ripe cherry, berry, mint and thyme flavors, with a hint of tangerine peel. The rich flavors are brightened by fresh acidity that leaves a clean rather than cloying finish.
Blackberry, vanilla, a hint of chemical and generic darkness drive the nose on this muscular, black-tinted blend of 78% Cabernet Sauvignon, 13% Malbec and 9% Syrah. The palate is grabby and fiercely tannic, while blackberry, herb and molasses flavors finish in heady, tannic, warm fashion.
This unoaked Chardonnay is powered by tangy lemon and pineapple flavors. It's medium-bodied and has nice concentration without seeming overly ripe. Butter and vanilla touches weave through its lively fresh fruit notes.
Dry and tannic, with an irregular mouthfeel. Feels tartly acidic, with a bitter raisin skin toughness, although there are some nice blackberry flavors.
This full-bodied Zinfandel adds in 10% Cabernet Franc and 5% Cabernet Sauvignon, which is an unusual blend but works really well. It shows a great mix of fruit and spice flavors, with a rich, smooth texture. It's lightly tannic, oozing raspberry and blackberry flavors on the palate and through the finish.
A food-friendly blend of Schiava and Lagrein (two native grapes of northern Italy) this ruby-colored wine opens with a lean consistency and medium build. It shows cool-climate aromas of small forest fruit and blue flowers with a touch of white almond on the close.
The second wine from the Saint-Julien estate, this is every bit as elegant as the grand vin, its black currant fruit developing to envelop the fine tannins. There is fine fruit, plenty of acidity and a rich texture. It needs time, so drink from 2020.
The late Claude Lafond was the driving force behind the renaissance of Reuilly. His wines, such as this with its balance between crisp herbal flavors and ripe, almost tropical fruit, bring out the richness of the appellation. This wine, with its final minerality, is ready to drink.
Juicy fruit aromas and flavors of raspberry and wild strawberry abound on the nose and mouth, framed by notes of vanilla crème, purple flowers and light foliage. Balanced and surprisingly quite approachable now with an overall soft profile and easy finish.
Wonderfully toasted up front, with baked, but not cooked, fruit aromas. There's also plenty of coffee, earth and leather to the bouquet. Initial live-wire flavors settle to reveal marzipan and dried stone fruits, while the sly finish is so complex that the wine ultimately registers as a different breed. Drinking this is like navigating a maze. A Marc de Grazia Selection, various importers.
The purity of fruit is the most striking aspect of this wine. While it is relatively light in texture, it revels in its fresh red-fruited character that gives an impressive intensity. With balanced touches of tannin and acidity, the wine should age well.
Smells plummy and ripe but tastes of bright cherries and shows a lean, claret-style mouthfeel. It's a little thin, but still manages to provide pleasure. Finishes with tasty mocha and toast shadings.  White Wine
Opens with a nice combination of melon, honey and mineral aromas. The wine is fresh and properly acidic, with defined apple, nectarine and melon flavors. On the finish, it's drying and lightweight, with a hint of papaya and a note of pith. Good overall; drink now.
While this is a fruity Chablis, it also shows some of the steeliness for which the appellation is known. It has ripe lemon and pineapple flavors that lend the wine an open character. It's ready to drink, but it could be aged for one year.
This deep-colored blend of Grenache and Syrah seems more like a light red than a true rosé. Cherry and crushed stone notes dominate, and there's a welcome hint of texture on the palate that would work well with burgers or steak. Drink up.
Light and fresh, this carries just a vague hint of barrel toast, but essentially it was done all in stainless. The fruit is clean and pretty, lightly candied, lightly tropical, with notes of sweet cracker, brisk acid, sweet grass and sweet herb. It gathers strength in the finish and holds on nicely.
This full-bodied wine brings a basket full of fruit to the table. It smells like grape juice and black cherries, and tastes plummy, almost jammy but not sweet. The tannins and acidity are lighter than usual, making it easy to enjoy.
Heavy and dull in the mouth. They seemed to have picked the darkest, ripest, softest, plummiest lots, and then plastered the wine with oak. Not bad for a Grenache, but lacks the vibrancy and lift you want from Pinot Noir.
Leafy and dull to start, with questionable freshness to the aromatics. More hard and tannic than you'd want, and herbal and tomatoey in the mouth. It even has a distinct salty, no-sugar finish. Where's the freshness?
Floral and accented in papaya, this is a crisp, balanced and easy-to-love wine, from a vineyard farmed organically and biodynamically planted to three different clones. Fig, pear and vanilla all make an appearance amidst a medium-bodied texture and crisp, appealing finish.
Quite a good Cabernet, pure and intense in varietal characteristics of black currants, but balanced and elegant. The tannins are smooth, the finish complex and long in spices. Delicious as it is now, your best bet is to cellar this Cab for 6–8 years, and possibly longer.
Smooth, ripe and easy, this wine brings out the fruitiness of the vintage. It has some dusty tannins, although it is so approachable and generous. Ripe berry fruits and soft acidity come through at the end. Drink from 2017.
The wine, with its firm tannins and solid structure, is still young. The hints of black-plum fruits are way behind the structure. That's all good, because this wine will come together well, to give a rich full wine with spice, juicy black fruits and acidity. Drink from 2020.
This offers plenty of tannins and a dry, firm structure along with the weight of ripe plums, blackberries and a rich character. The wine is certainly going to age, with its solid texture and bold fruit aftertaste. Drink from 2017.
Aromas of coconut, spicy plum cake, mocha and vanilla waft out of the glass. The warm palate doles out stewed plum, blackberry, espresso, licorice and a confectionary note alongside bracing, astringent tannins that dry the mouth. The intense oak sensations throw this off balance.
Karl Fritsch's base Grüner sums up his style perfectly. Freshness, lightness of touch, bright and easy to drink, but at the same time capturing the crisp edge of the grape and the warmth of the vineyard. Crisp, green fruits bring the whole wine together.
Another lovely effort from Nelms Road. This is firm and loaded with dense black fruits, the long midpalate spreading deliciously into a full, rich, earthy finish. Forest floor, earth, hints of leather and barnyard, and lovely fruit all mingle to create a rich and sexy wine.
This is a relatively gentle, light Cabernet Franc. It reveals a pretty, juicy blueberry flavor as well as a muted herb note. A whiff of violet and a dash of vanilla run through the finish.
Very light, crisp, fresh, it has some sweetness that is balanced by the acidity and raspberry fruit. For those who like a really pink color in their rosés, this is perfect. Screwcap.
This wine is dense and fruity, yet still a fresh and lively wine. The contrast between rich yellow fruits and crisp acidity gives the wine a good tension, offering a fine texture and nervous edge. Great to drink now, but worth aging a year. Screwcap.
Stone-fruit aromas are the opening, and they're on the full, waxy, fleshy side. This weighs in with low acidity, and that results in broad flavors of papaya and green melon. A round finish, much like the nose, shows a fleshy component.
This opens with stone fruit, citrus, honey and yellow rose notes. The mouthfeel is thick and rich, and the wine moves with silky grace across the palate.
Light, crisp, lemon-scented, with fresh apricots, pear juice and toast flavors. This is a wine that gives immediate pleasure, but with just a tight steeliness at the core to promise some aging. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.
Coming from the cool 2011 vintage, the aromas of herbs, apple and spice are light. It's medium bodied and creamy in feel with a lemony finish.
This bold, balanced wine opens with classic Sangiovese aromas of underbrush, dried tobacco leaf, red berries, blue flower and a waft of leather. The juicy palate shows depth, delivering ripe wild cherry accented with white pepper, licorice and a mineral note alongside solid but refined tannins. Drink 2016–2024.
Peach and cantaloupe aromas are friendly and easy. A creamy palate with modest acidity offers slightly sweet flavors of dulce de leche and melon. A modest finish with spice and sugary notes closes this out.
While subdued on the nose, crunchy Asian pear and green-apple flavors on the palate are persistent and vital. Racy acidity and delicate sweetness balance neatly. A refreshing, thirst quenching wine with wide appeal.
A soft wine, with just a touch of sweetness. The ripe fruit lends a gentle, smooth texture, and it's balanced with attractive red-currant acidity.
Full, earthy and ripe, but also delivering alot of clean fruit, size and balance. The palate has moderate to full tannic grip, which props up berry, vanilla, wood and mild herbal flavors. Long, solid and a little oaky late, with proper purity and a commitment to the near future. Drink now through 2011.
Glen Carlou's wines are far from shy and this delicious Meritage from Paarl has all of the bold notes you'd expect from this producer. The nose is elegant, with waves of cinnamon, tobacco and spice, and on the palate, flavors of red berry, spice and smoke are distinctive but harmonious. This is a wine that will continue to unfold as it ages.
Thin and disjointed, with strawberry soda fruit flavors that drop off quickly into an amorphous midpalate. There's some plastic aftertaste in the finish.
There's a lovely vibrancy to the nose of this wine, as initial aromas of green melon and lime peel are laced with attractive herbal hits of fynbos and white flowers. The medium-weight palate offers a plush yet balanced feel, with ample acidity to counter the notes of toasted red apple, honeydew and honeycomb. Spicy wood tones dance on the lingering finish. It's delicious now, but should age well through 2021.
Thoroughly delicious. This captures a distinctive side of the grape that blends a sweet grassy herbaceousness with a lively mix of apple, lemongrass, citrus and orange peel, finished with the slightest suggestion of honey.
Sweet and simple, this easy blush wine has strawberry, brown sugar and vanilla flavors.
Subtle aromas of sunbaked earth, toast, French oak and chopped herb slowly emerge in the glass. The aromas carry over to the round robust palate along with raspberry jam, dried black cherry, licorice and baking spice while velvety tannins lend finesse. You'll also detect the warmth of alcohol on the close. Drink 2018–2023.
Some producer in Carneros didn't want the wine that went into this negociant's ‘07 Syrah, to judge by its quality. Lucky for Cameron Hughes. It's a fine wine, full-bodied and dry, with spicy flavors of currants, teriaki beef, black pepper and cola, with a bracing minerality that grounds the richness. Could be more concentrated, but it's a very great value.
Green and yellow apple notes play on the nose. They also fizz frothily on the fresh easy palate—almost weightless and totally dry. There are slightly bitter edges to the dry finish which are not unpleasant. With its litheness, this comes across as very refreshing and wonderfully pure.
Rustic and tannic, with earthy flavors of berries and spices, but it's dry and clean. At this price, not bad for big occasions when you need a versatile house red.
Slightly vegetal on the nose and palate, with hints of green peppers, this dry Riesling gains freshness on the palate with tart apple-skin flavors accented by hints of black pepper spice.
This Chardonnay balances fresh and lush flavors, offering a toasty spice and apple nose and flavors of creamy vanilla toast and apple, peach and warming spice. Approachable but displaying some complexity. A friendly everyday white.
Lockwood hitches a ride on the Argentine Malbec express, with mixed results. The wine is dark and acidic and properly bone dry, with earthy, dark berry, coffee, leather and bitter chocolate flavors. But there's a disagreeable green sharpness.
A very shy closed nose gives little away but the palate reveals all. A beautifully lithe and fluid synthesis of ripe and tart orchard fruits is leavened by bright citrus, green pear, Cox's apple and pure ripe Amalfi lemon. There also is a fine hint of discreet herbal lift—chamomile and chervil can be glimpsed here and there. What an aromatic, statuesque beauty. Alluring now but absolutely certain to become spectacular with some age. The finish is totally dry, aromatic and long. Drink 2017–2037.
No doubt a blend of Hawkes Bay and Gisborne fruit that's unfortunately lost its way in a lumberyard. It's full, indicating adequate sugar levels, but lacks fruit flavor, instead relying on wood for much of its character.
Aromas of plum and blue fruit are accented by high-toned spices and milk chocolate. Flavors are soft, palate coating and poised, with blue-fruit flavors lingering on the finish. It doesn't necessarily taste like Merlot but still brings plenty of appeal.
The lightest of the 2012 single-vineyard Pinot Noirs from Giant Steps, this is an almost delicate wine with silky tannins. Notes of smoke, earth and mushroom mark the nose, while hints of pine boughs impart a slightly medicinal edge to the cherry fruit. Drink now.
Spice bread, almond paste, cinnamon, fudge, orange peel with dry, dusty earth notes are amplified by a lavish, velvety structure with menthol freshness on a long, firm finish. Would pair with tarragon-based sauces or herb-roasted meats. Imported by Empson (USA) Ltd.
This organic Brut Prosecco puts emphasis on floral and herbal notes that emerge at the side of subtle notes of peach and citrus. The wine is tart and steely in the mouth with a dry, slightly bitter close.
With fruit sourced from the Neive, Alba and Treiso areas, this Barbaresco shows loads of tradition and typicity with small berry nuances, tar, asphalt and granite mineral notes on the close. The mouthfeel is tight, sharp and long-lasting.
Pure and unblocked by anything other than raisin, maple and brown sugar aromas and flavors. It's thick as motor oil, with a mile-long finish and lasting notes of pecan pie and cinnamon coffee cake. Maybe it's a little candied and easygoing, but who's complaining?
So light in color, it's almost clear. Talc-powder aromas waft from the nose; on the palate, delicate yellow fruit is accented by floral notes. It's very unusual to find Margaret River wines at this price, so grab it up. Imported by Aussie Imports.
Jammy, rich and leathery, this full-bodied, robust wine has a touch of smoke lingering in the back, beneath soft, well-integrated oak. Juicy, it's enjoyable now, while being structured enough to go another decade or so. Cellar through 2021.
The stainless-steel style reveals lots of green-leaning fruit on this wine: green pear, green banana and kiwi, altogether quite tropical. Similarly, the palate shows lime pith, apple blossoms and apple soda, moving toward a sour and bitter sensation as well.
Scents of ripe dark-skinned fruit, leather, carob, black culinary spice and Mediterranean herbs meld in the glass. The polished, structured palate includes juicy blackberry, ripe black cherry, ground pepper, licorice and exotic spice alongside velvety tannins that lend a smooth, almost creamy texture. This seamlessly combines full flavor, power and elegance.
While this is supple and rich with loads of sweet blackberry and blueberry fruit, the penetrating minerality and a swathe of fresh flower and herb add depth and grace to this lovely Merlot. The tannins are still quite taut, yet they're ripe in nature. It drinks deliciously now, but it's structured enough to improve over the next five years.
Rustic tomato and cherry aromas make for a scratchy opening. This is wiry and grating in feel, with sour plum and red-currant flavors. A fresh but scratchy and herbal tasting finish isn't exactly friendly.
The second wine of the historic Mouchão estate, this contains less Alicante Bouschet than the top wine, while still having great power and concentration. There is a crisp feel, as well as plenty of acidity and forward black-currant fruit. It will be ready to drink from 2018.
Made from Touriga Nacional, this is a deliciously light, crisp and clean strawberry-flavored wine. It has lively acidity and a real summer feel. Screwcap.
Very light fruit flavors of citrus and yellow apple. The wine was done entirely in stainless steel, with no barrel aging, yet somehow a vanilla streak has snuck into the finish. It's yeasty and crisp, with a residual flavor of wet steel.
Rich and lusty smelling, with a tight, saturated, grabby palate full of big berry, bacon and oaky flavors. The tannins are big and grabby, while the finish of espresso and toast ends with bitterness. Forceful and oaky RDD. Imported by USA Wine West.
Capichera's Vermentino has been in production for more than 20 years. The wine is evolved, complex and sophisticated and promises a long aging future ahead. The aromas recall apricot, peach and honey.
Baked strawberries and cherries meet with vanilla and baking spice on the nose of this bottling. The palate is very approachable and pleasant, with chalky tannins presenting more baked cherry flavor as well as red currant, clove and star anise. The spice is quite penetrating.
Red cherry fruit, with edges of white pepper, plays charmingly on both the nose and palate. The svelte figure of the wine belies its depth: this has subtle, Burgundian virtues and earthy undertones that provoke stimulating conversation and thought. An ideal accompaniment for subtle, nuanced dishes or a really good book.
Aromas of burnt wood and spice cover rugged gritty berry scents. This is a tight minerally wiry Garnacha that's oaky on the palate. Oak-rich plum flavors finish with strong tannins, residual grit and lasting wood-based notes. Drink through 2022.
Aromas recall forest floor, mature black-skinned fruit, leather, resin and tilled earth. The warm, round palate doles out ripe red cherry marinated in spirits, cinnamon, carob and grilled herb alongside polished tannins. It's extremely accessible so enjoy soon.
This Petite Sirah-led blend, which also features 24% Syrah, 9% Grenache and 1% Viognier, offers deep violet aromas alongside pine, tarragon and sea salt caramel. There's a strong molasses and pancakes-with-fruity-syrup character on the palate and very soft mouthfeel. Definitely a dessert sipper.
Sweet ripe plum fruit flavors are laced with acidity and soft, dusty tannins in this smoky tobacco-scented wine. It is smooth, rich, ready to drink.
Deep red-violet in the glass, this wine has a nose of black cherry, smoked meat and a hint of green pepper.

The finish is characterized by a touch of orange peel and a sense of salinity.
This family-owned producer based in the Aube has made a ripe Pinot Noir-dominated wine. It's full and structured with light tannins and minerality. Its acidity and ripe currant fruit lend balanced richness. Drink now.
Bellezza is now labeled Chianti Classico (through 2007 it was labeled only as Toscana), based on Sangiovese grapes that deliver aromas of cherry, toasted almond, chocolate, rum cake and exotic spice. The wine is long, fresh and intense in the mouth and would pair well with steak and grilled porcini mushrooms.
Very firm in tannins, this Petite Sirah is astringent and closed right now. It's hard to appreciate the sweetly ripe cherry and licorice flavors. Could improve significantly over the years, but there's no guarantee.
This bright pink-ruby rosé features attractive aromas of watermelon rind and cherries. It's medium in body, fresh and vibrant on the palate, bursting with crunchy fresh fruit reminiscent of raspberries and cherries. Drink now.
This wine is likeable for its warm, round aromas of canned peas, banana peel, and a hint of toast. The grapefruit and herbs on the palate lack complexity.
From clay and limestone soil, this wine is full bodied. It has both spice and a tight, nervy, mineral texture. Rich with a full mouthful of raspberry and red-currant fruits, it has a refreshing aftertaste.
This opens with leafy underbrush aromas accompanied by whiffs of blue flower, rubber and toasted oak. The palate's oak-driven sensations of chocolate and coffee muffle the restrained blackberry and black cherry flavors. Polaner Selections, Ambrosia Wine Group.
This pure expression of Nero d'Avola offers broad aromas of red berry, blackberry and currant. The fruit is on the dry side, made complex with aromas that recall wet earth and tobacco. The palate is elegant and layered.
The faintest notes of sea-breeze conjure up lemony freshness on the nose of this spritzy, light-bodied and fragrant wine. The aromatic allure of citrus foliage and lime zest unfolds beautifully on the creamy, balanced palate and makes for grown-up fun.
This silky Rosso offers a lean, compact mouthfeel and intense aromas of red fruit, smoked almond, black olive and sour cherry. There's a savory note of cured meat on the finish.
Aromas of black plums, medicinal sour cherries and toasted nuts seem sweet and oxidative—like a fortified wine. With that in mind, this is a table wine, and it tastes unexpectedly dry. Mild tannins and yielding acids encase the dominant sour-cherry flavor.
While it still has firm tannins, the wine is now also showing maturity. The color is changing, the hints of berry fruits fading behind the sweet and sour flavors and the dark, dry core. The wine has considerable acidity, leaving an aftertaste that is still fresh.
Aromas of jasmine and honeysuckle entice your nose and flavors of lemon lime and apple cider excite your palate. This dry Hungarian Furmint has both a strong minerality and a crisp finish.
Fresh like a peach on the nose, with a bit of warm radiator dust. Flavors of lemon and green apple are narrow, and the mouthfeel is limited and indicates that the lifespan of the wine may be short. Citric on the finish, and overall there's just not a lot going on here.
Still firm in tannins, this has developed into an austere and dark wine. It is serious and solid, with a firm, brooding character and layers of acidity as well as black currant fruits. It is probably ready to drink now.
“Won't cost you an arm and a leg” is Fat Croc's motto. Made in the unoaked, ripe and juicy Australian style, this nicely combines deliciously juicy, tropical fruit flavors with plenty of bracing acid. It avoids the hot, flabby, fake oak flavors that plague most cheap Chardonnays, and gives you a wine that will work better with many foods than a lot of the pricey stuff.
This wine features a bouquet of blackberry, toffee and mocha. It is very soft in the mouth, with flavors of blackberry, blueberry and vanilla and a nice tart finish.
Cranberry, dried sage, sour cherry, thyme and dried chaparral shrubbery show on the nose of this wine from an oceanview vineyard near Ben Lomond. The palate is fairly lithe and bouncy with acidity, showing lots of crushed bay leaf and wild sage as well as underripe strawberry and richer cranberry notes.
Creamy aloe vera, white pepper, green pear and lemon zest create an irresistible nose. The palate is equally creamy but also comes on light, tiptoe feet. There is a pleasant, slightly bitter zesty edge to the slender palate which belies all the charm. An intriguing, arresting Grüner.
Dark berry, sawdust, oak-driven spice and tobacco aromas emerge in the glass. It's still tense, with tightly packed tannins and fresh acidity that backup flavors of oak, toast, espresso, licorice and cherry steeped in spirits. It's shy on fruit richness, making the alcohol noticeable.
Exceeds even this producer's stunning beerenauslese, featuring an even more intoxicating perfume of honey, dried apricots and candied pineapple, with slightly more acidity to provide balance to the extra level of sweetness, so much so that this wine comes across as refreshing on the finish, despite the incredibly high levels of sugar. Drink now–2050, possibly longer.
New wood aromas give this very fine wine a firm start in life. It also shows rich blackberry fruits, dark plums and a solid, tannic character. Dense and concentrated with a smooth surface hiding a much firmer core. A serious wine  needing aging.
Ripe and fleshy, this wine is firm and dry, but has extra-ripe fruit. Perhaps the fruit is too rich, leaving the wine unbalanced. In the future, it will show fewer tannins and more fruit. Corinne and Charles-Henri Gonet of the Gonet Champagne family bought Bacalan with the intent of restructuring the vineyards, some of which had not been planted for 70 years. The first red vintage was 2001; first white vintage was 2014.
Here's a floral-smelling, light-style mix of Moscatel and Macabeo that will function best as a quaffing wine. It smells of acacia and orange blossom, showing modest weight and acidity, with citrus and tropical fruit flavors. The finish is short and light.
Sweet spring flowers and citrus highlights characterize this generous Prosecco Brut with creamy effervescence and mature peach flavors. The perky sparkler has a drying finish with lingering mineral tones.
Luxuriously crafted to be lush and robust, this blends 76% Pinot Noir and 24% Chardonnay with ease and gusto. The palate is dominated by layered flavors of baked strawberry and cherry.
For an under-$15 red blend, Corte has it going on. It's rich and full, almost syrupy on the nose, with lots of oak, ink and vanilla. Shows power and packs a punch, with dark berry, chocolate and spicy flavors. A little tannic and scratchy, but with structure and framework to spare. Malbec (80%), with Bonarda and Petit Verdot.
Unabashedly tropical on the nose and palate with gobs of ripe mango, guava and peach, this cheerful Chardonnay is fresh and juicy, with lemon-lime acidity and a surprisingly-elegant minerality on the finish. Drink now.
This stainless bottling shows fresh-squeezed lemons, yellow melon and canned pear on the fresh, clean and not overly tropical nose. The palate is smooth and plush down the middle, but sharply tight on the edges, with flavors of pear, lime and apple that prove a bit sour and tart toward the finish.
Aromas of blue flower, leafy forest floor, blackberry and baking spices lead the nose on this extremely accessible Amarone. The bright, full-bodied palate offers black cherry, prune and licorice alongside velvety but fleeting tannins and just enough freshness.
This estate delivered a fine Rosso di Montalcino in 2008 and less certain results with its Brunello the same year. The issue is the sharp acidity that really makes your mouth pucker. Thankfully, the intense crispness is balanced by softer spice, black fruit and tobacco aromas.
From one of the Valpolicella's best producers, this vineyard-designate Amarone is amazingly soft and velvety, with aromas of softly worn leather, moist chewing tobacco, ripe black cherry and barbecue smoke. It's an elegant but modern rendition, showing power, intensity and impressive length. Best yet, the fruit is young enough to promise more years of graceful aging.
Gentle and uncomplicated, but with class and finesse, this dry wine shows blackberry flavors with overtones of green olives and coffee. It has a good grip and finish.
Using grapes sourced from Klipsun Vineyard, this is a roughly even Sauvignon Blanc–Sémillon blend. Flavors of sweet toast, lemon verbena and melon, with a hint of mint and a splash of orange soda are all in evidence. Nicely nuanced, this does not overreach, but rather zooms in on the details of aroma and flavor that keep it interesting.
Rather light and very smooth, this combines tasty plum flavors with subtle oaky, earthy accents and medium body. Enough varietal character keeps things interesting.
This oak-aged expression  offers loads of ripe, jammy fruit followed by root beer, spice, leather and tobacco nuances. The wine is intense, soft, plush and chewy in the mouth with rich, succulent tannins.
Always a great value, this warm and fruity wine is immediately accessible and drinkable. It has fine red berry fruits, a good core of tannins and just the right fruit acidity. Drink now.
Roasted, leathery berry aromas carry a cheesy, gritty, piercing element. In the mouth, this is solid but slightly syrupy. Flavors of rooty berry, licorice and chocolate finish with plenty of oak, spice notes and heat.
Beefy black-fruit aromas are inviting for their accents of licorice, coconut and crushed minerals. Feels lush, layered and intense, the perfect framework for lusty blackberry, toast, mineral and espresso flavors. Long, warm and dense on the finish. Drink now through 2016; made from Malbec, Bonarda and Cab Sauvignon.
The vineyard of gnarled, very old vines is on a picturesque stretch of West Dry Creek Valley road, and the wine shows classic old vine characteristics. It's enormously concentrated in berry liqueur, cassis, spice and mineral flavors, and the finish is impressively dry. The alcohol level is high, but that's what it takes to get a Zinfandel this ripe and delicious.
Sauska's premiere bottling, the Cuvée 11 has a hefty dose of Cabernet Franc, giving it a distinct spice and bramble character. It's not a dainty wine at 15% abv, but the palate is clean with focused red fruit accented by fresh herbs and balanced tannins.
This is an easy-going Prosecco with lively tones of stone fruit and citrus. The wine is informal and tonic which makes it perfect as an appetizer wine or with friends on a lazy summer afternoon.
This wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec, Syrah and Petit Verdot. Intricate aromas of vanilla, cedar, powdered chocolate, pipe tobacco and black cherry lead to focused, layered fruit and barrel flavors that show persistence.
This new release from Waterbrook is a slimmed down version of previous efforts, with rather plain fruit flavors and no discernible new oak influence. Not that that is necessarily a bad thing, but when Chardonnay is built upon little but simple green apple fruit flavors the grape's lack of character sometimes makes you wish for the return of the good old oaky days.
Pungent tones of almond skin and peanut disturb this Prosecco Brut that otherwise shows bright luminosity and persistent perlage. The sparkler has sour notes on the close and lingering nutty flavors.
The tart fruitfulness of ripe, red apples rises from the glass. Chock-full of appetizing apple notes, this brings more flavor than your average Pinot Blanc. Drink soon while aromas abound.
The winery's oaky-smoky style is well-suited to Merlot in ripe years such as this, and it's a very seductive wine. Nuances of pipe tobacco, dried herb, dust, coffee grounds and butterscotch complement the strawberry-cherry flavors of Pepper Bridge fruit. Sophisticated and smooth, with plenty of tannic grip.
Ferrari-Carano grows the grapes in the high hills above the Anderson Valley, unproven ground for Pinot Noir. The wine is rich and rather heavy. It's fruit-forward and delicious in cherry pie, cola and sandalwood flavors, yet lacks zest. Drink now.
Has great weight and texture, with an unctuous, oily mouthfeel, and is crisp and dry. Almost like a great Chablis, with a tang of steel and minerals undergirding the limes, pineapples and wildflowers. The grapes are from the well-regarded Sierra Madre Vineyard.
Subdued aromas of ripe dark-skinned berry, espresso and tobacco lead the nose while the soft, dense palate offers fleshy black cherry, blackberry extract, coffee and a hint of ground cooking spice. It's ripe and ready so enjoy soon.
Stewed fig and blackberry aromas meet a dried herb accent on the nose. The full-bodied palate brings additional notes of blueberry jam blended with tarragon and marjoram. It's an easy sipper for a ruby Port-style wine made from Chambourcin.
This is a beautifully floral, high in acidity white made in small quantities that offers classically lean layers of wet stone and lemon. With a low imprint of oak, it remains structured on the palate and entirely pleasing from start to finish, its honeysuckle aromas singularly inviting.
90–92. Barrel sample. This is a full and ripe wine that slowly reveals its rich, full-bodied character. On the mid palate, dry Saint-Estèphe tannins come through to show the immense concentration of the wine.
While this vineyard is close by the Russian River and is not considered the best of Rochioli's vineyards, winemaker Bob Cabral consistently makes its grapes into one of Williams Selyem's most compelling wines. This shows the impeccable tannins and acids of Rochioli fruit, with sweet, ripe, deep flavors of cherry and spice. Notes of pomegranate, rum punch, dark chocolate and smoky sandalwood add complexity. Beautiful to drink now, it should continue to develop for at least 10 years.
A light, unidimensional Zin showing easy flavors of berries, cola and spices. Clean and dry, it's a good everyday sipper, at a fair price.
This wine is sourced from grapes grown in an organic estate vineyard in the heart of the Green Valley. Flavors of raspberries and pomegranates are delicious, and new French oak marries seamlessly with the fruit. Vibrant coastal acidity makes everything sing. If there's an off note, it's a mushroom and veggie note, courtesy of the cold vintage. The wine is already softening in tannins so drink now.
Tapteil, Ciel and Cara Mia vineyard fruit, a blend of 35% Cabernet Sauvignon, 31% Merlot, 28% Cab Franc and 6% Petit Verdot. Young and tight, with the characteristic Cadence chalk and stone undertone. The fruit is pretty strawberry, with a peppery herbal streak, good length and fine balance.
Flowery, tropical aromas are pure Torrontés, although this one turns to applesauce the longer it breathes. A healthy-feeling but generic palate deals flavors of Thompson seedless white grapes and honeydew. It has a fresh but faint finish.
This is a concentrated, dark and very closed wine. It has a tight, nervy character that allows you to feel the fruit and the texture that comes from the limestone soil. This impressive, ageworthy wine needs aging over six years and more.
Élevage in one-third new oak has imparted toast, vanilla and cedar aromas and given the texture of this wine a plush edge, but the quality of the underlying fruit and the length of the finish are undeniable. The primary blackberry fruit should develop hints of coffee and black olive in short order; drink 2013–2019.
Spicy, dry aromas of tobacco, campfire, herbs and berry fruits lead to a raw, oaky palate of plum, cassis and woody, lemony flavors. A middle-of-the-road finish with heat tastes like what came before it. The blend is 85% Cabernet Sauvignon with Cab Franc and Petit Verdot.
Barrel notes of toast and spice intermingle with stone fruit aromas and flavors that show nuance. The flavors are light but the feel is compelling.
The most full-bodied of Sojourn's new Pinot Noirs, a rich, thick wine of Grenache-like proportions. Although it's delicious now in cherries, red currants, licorice, cocoa and sandalwood, it's a bit heavy and tannic. Could emerge like a butterfly from this cocoon sometime after mid-2010.
Cherry fruit with candy highlights quickly fills your mouth. Washington Merlot is often more substantial in this price range than competing wine regions. Nonetheless, this is a lightly herbal effort, with a slightly metallic finish.
On the nose it's sweet, smooth and seductive, but that's where the sweet nothings end. The palate is super concentrated and intense, with almost overpowering blackberry and boysenberry fruit. A high-octane red if there ever was one, and that's all hammered home on the warm, menthol-laden finish.
Refreshing and crisp, this is a light, citrus-flavored wine. Great shots of acidity course through the wine to give an intensely fresh and fragrant aftertaste.
Pierres Blanches (white stones) constitute the soil of this parcel. That gives a strongly textured, mineral character, as well as allowing room for the ripe apple and citrus flavors. The wine is rich, rounded and will age. Drink from 2016.
The region of Lazio in central Italy is not well-known for its wines, but this well-priced 50-50 blend of Montepulciano and Merlot shows its enological potential. This is a rich and penetrating wine with loads of black fruit and spice.
Spine-tingling acidity runs throughout this off-dry Riesling. Swathes of honey and fresh apple, saffron and dried berries lend sweetness and warmth, but this striking kabinett does not surrender its sharp edges easily.
Cascina Ballarin's Barolo Bricco Rocca comes from the La Morra area of the Langhe and offers intense aromas of blue flower, violets, almond flowers, cinnamon and powdered licorice. The focus here is on elegance and harmony and the mouthfeel follows through with power and determination. This is a truly beautiful wine
Robust tannins soften slowly in the glass as this hearty, straightforward wine opens, showing touches of red and black cherry fruit.
A lovely wine to have at picnics, on the beach, backyard barbecues, even at the table with everything from fried calamari and goat cheese to roast pork and fresh fruit. Completely dry and racy in acids, it shows intense, nervy flavors of citrus fruits and zest, with spicy notes of medjool dates.
A well-crafted, very drinkable wine that exhibits all the best in good, straightforward Bordeaux. Good ripe tannins and fine, classic fruits, with dryness and style rather than power.
Ripe plum, tilled earth, violet, espresso and toast aromas waft out of the glass. The palate offers dried black cherry, mocha and roasted coffee bean alongside fleeting tannins.
Dry and crisp, but so watered down, there's practically nothing there. Shows the barest hint of of citrus and flower flavors.
Quite floral and thus it smells different than the usual beefy, black-fruit-dominated Malbecs that Mendoza is known for. On the palate, it's zesty and yields cherry, raspberry and chocolate flavors. The mouthfeel is crisp and stylish, while the finish settles and doesn't seem too acidic or lean.
Stoller does an all-stainless style of Chardonnay, and does it well consistently. The winery slogan—Authentically Oregon—fits the ultraclean, crisp and authoritative styling. The fresh apple fruit is pushed along by sappy acidity, showing length, purity and focus.
The nose is not very suggestive, however, the palate comes alive and paints a vivid picture of both refreshing and mellow notes of red and black cherry. The body shows a lovely, fine-grained texture that brushes softly against the tongue to send more ripples of cinnamon-spiced cherries your way. Fresh, lively and beautifully aromatic with a mellow finish tinged with peony and rose.
Bright and crisp, this fruity wine shows touches of peach and pear. Acidity creates a lively wine that still has a feeling of richness. Wait until 2015 for it to open up.
There's a strong herbal presence in the bouquet of this wine (bay leaves, clover) that marries well with the red plum and dried raspberry flavors. The mouth is smooth and creamy with a touch of tobacco spice lingering on the close. Drink now–2012.
Salmon pink in color, this rosé brings buttery and floral (orange blossom, night jasmine) aromas together for an all-encompassing bouquet, powered by the 19% Grenache inclusion. On the palate, tropical touches of papaya and mango dance with tart apple and nectarine flavors, which get midpalate lifting from the 6% boost of Riesling as well.
From a mix of Milbrandt vineyard sites, this outstanding blend includes small amounts of Cabernet, Syrah, Malbec and Barbera. The blend was so well done that each component adds a vital piece to the whole—smooth berry and cherry fruits, spice, tobacco, licorice and smoke, folding into a lush and chocolaty finish.
This sure is an oaky Chard, but it's big enough to handle it. The fruit is extraordinarily ripe and forward, bursting with mango, pear and sautéed banana flavors. What the wine lacks in subtlety it makes up for in sheer, unadulterated power.
This tasty, medium-bodied blend is about half Sauvignon Blanc, with the balance split almost evenly between Chardonnay and Semillon. Struck flint marks the nose, while the flavors suggest hints of asparagus and fig. Drink now.
This is a light wine with bright acidity and red fruit flavors. It has a mere touch of tannin to give structure to the crisp aftertaste. Drink now.
This is a new vineyard designation for Sineann, and stands out for its dark plum hue and its distinctly herbal nose. The scents are of herb and tomato leaf more than sweet fruit, but the flavors are Burgundian and earthy, with well-managed layering. Young vines, tough weather, yields tannins that are slightly grainy and taste again like clean earth.
Few are experimenting with this black grape variety, but Brian and Stephanie Terrizzi's bottlings—including this one from the Paso Highlands—suggest more should. Deep, rich and intriguing aromas of stewed plums, vanilla-bean cake and Chinese hoisin sauce give way to heady flavors of blue and purple fruit, all seasoned expertly and showing great verve.
Funky aromas are sweaty, foxy and feline in nature. This doesn't have a lot of feel or texture, while the flavors on this brut nature are a bit weedy and grassy. The fruit character is quite short on the finish.
Pineapple and spice on the nose are followed by like flavors on the palate. An interplay of acid adds quality to the wine but overall, it lacks dimension and the kind of layering that typifies good Chardonnay.
This Chardonnay is a touch volatile on the nose, which deals some gym sweat and brine. Eventually things break down to dusty, soft white-fruit aromas. Flavors of banana, papaya and white pepper end with tropical notes. This is just good enough.
Aromatic, with smoke, earth and barbecue on the nose. Dry tannins in the mouth; black plum and oak are the principal flavors here. Would pair well with a broad range of foods, from pizzas to pastas and burgers. A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Shiraz and Merlot. 4,000 cases imported.
Shows classic Oakville tannins that are big, ripe, and intricate, but hard, entirely opposite to the softness of the modern cult style. The fruit suggests blackberries and cassis, enriched with smoky-sweet, spicy oak. It's a beautifully structured, dry and elegant 100% Cabernet, but it's too tannic for full enjoyment now. Better 2012–2016.
A tremendous achievement in Merlot. The vineyard, around 1,600 feet up on Mt. Veeder, is now owned by the Jackson family, and the winemaker is Chris Carpenter, who oversees Cardinale. In fact, this Merlot bears an uncanny resemblance to Cardinale in the dramatically ripe, sweet fruit and superb, tannin-based structure. It's 100% Merlot, with hefty yet balanced alcohol, and the wine easily handles the 85% new French oak in which it was aged for 22 months.
It is rare to find Tinta Barroca on its own. Normally it is used for blending in Port. Here, though, it is in all its ripe fruit glory, an attractive, relatively lightweight wine. It's for drinking now, with red berry fruits right to the fore.
This fruity wine is full of juicy red berries that are laced with acidity. Hints of wood aging stay in the background of this essentially fresh and bright wine.
Lovely aromatics introduce this subtly powerful Pinot Noir. Floral highlights lead into tart cherry fruit that seems to gather strength as it flows across the palate. There are hints of mineral and a splash of coffee in the lingering finish.
This opens with aromas suggesting red berry, blue flower, menthol and a whiff of oak. On the angular palate, raspy tannins and brisk acidity underscore raw cherry and orange peel.
Very peppery even for Syrah. Marked also by intense blackberry jam flavors, it's a full-bodied, tannic bruiser, but one with brooding depth. Decant it a few hours before serving.
This is a restrained example of Viognier, compared to the grape's exotic, expressive paradigm. It shows a slight bitterness on the nose and palate that's akin to crushed papaya seeds, with additional notes of lemon pulp and flower. Full and hefty, the acids lend lift, but the concentration of flavors could use a boost.
This unusual blend of Silvaner and Traminer shows a distinctly earthy edge to its grapefruit and melon flavors and a pronounced tart tang that balances its ripe plumpness on the palate. Drink now.
This creamy wine has a really ripe character. Acidity comes from the cooler location of the vineyard, while the warmth of the summer shows through in the yellow fruits as well as in the fresh, crunchy red apples. A textured edge conveys minerality and leaves a fresh, clean taste in the mouth. Drink from 2017.
A wood-aged Chenin Blanc from the Chinon region, this is a new departure for Charles Joguet. The wine is opulent and concentrated from lees stirring, giving power from the quince fruit and elegance from the smooth texture. It could age for several years.
Ripe red cherry fruit, laced with refreshing acidity, gives this wine a great lift and liveliness. Its fruit goes right through the palate, with soft tannins as a backdrop. Drink this year.
From a small portion of the Fonréaud vineyard, this blend of 65% Sauvignon Blanc with Sémillon and Muscadelle is delicately wood aged to give a ripe fruity wine with added spice. It is perfumed and aromatic with a smooth creamy texture. With its intense acidity, it is a delicious and refreshing wine. Drink now.
Frizzante Proseccos are made with less atmospheric pressure and therefore taste extremely smooth and silky in the mouth. The aromas here are not particularly intense but do reveal good fruit and mineral notes.
Made from 90% Cabernet Sauvignon with Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec sprinkled in, this wine starts out quite reticent, with notes of scorched earth, mocha, herbs, woodspice and cherry. It's full bodied and very tightly wound at present, with firm, chalky tannins that need significant time in the cellar to stretch their legs. Best after 2018.
Made from a blend of 90% Sangiovese and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon, this richly structured wine opens with a aromas of mature black berries, vanilla and black spices. The palate offers black cherry, prune, espresso and black spices alongside bracing, drying tannins.
This is an elegant, refined style of wine, with all the elements in balance. There is wood, green and white fruits, fresh acidity and repressed power. This is a Chablis style that needs aging—give it at least 5 years.
Light to medium in body, this is a silky-textured Pinot that shows some understated cherry fruit and a fair bit of mushrooms and decaying leaves. Mocha and cinnamon mark the finish.
Tight and perhaps in a bit of a dumb stage, this opens slowly, and shows raspberry and black cherry fruit, with a streak of cola and orange marmalade. Sleek and fruity, perhaps best for near-term drinking.
This amped-up vintage of the Merlot-dominated, BFM Bordeaux-style red tops 15% alcohol, but seems a bit contrived. Aggressive vanilla and tobacco flavors cover up the nuanced highlights found in past BFM vintages, and the base of black cherry fruit carries a root beer finish. Not that it isn't a tasty drink—it is—it's just less interesting than before.
A pity this wine was released so young. It's not showing well now, tasting like a simple fruit bomb, with cherry and raspberry jam flavors and lots of sweet, caramelized oak. But the tannin-acid balanced is very good. Should be better in a year or two.
Here's an everyday Chard with interesting features. It has citrusy, lime zest flavors and high acidity, and the absolute dryness serves to accentuate the tartness. That makes it very clean, with a razorsharp edge that will be nice with fresh cracked crab.
A super Tuscan blend of Sangiovese, Merlot, Syrah and Alicante, this shows some of the cheerful, funky and lively characteristics that identify this wine with Maremma, Tuscany. This velvety effort offers notes of chocolate, blackberry, chewy cherry and tobacco.
Dark concentration and a deep garnet color make a great first impression and the wine follows through with ripe aromas of dried blackberry, spice, tar, resin and cola. This is a dense and determined Ripasso and the sweet fruit flavors it releases on the palate shape the wine's soft, supple finish.
Straightforward black plum skin, peppercorn and caramel aromas show on the faint nose of this twist-top bottling, which includes 10% each of Petit Verdot and Malbec. Although thin in body, it has mouth-prickling tannins and tangy acidity, framing its boysenberry and white pepper flavors.
Berry, lemon peel, tobacco and molasses aromas make for a rich and appealing bouquet. The palate is chewy and mildly syrupy in feel, with baked black-fruit flavors receiving a boost from molasses and spice notes. This is dark, handsome and generous but not overly complex. Drink now–2016.
Perhaps this just needs some additional time for the Cabernet and Shiraz components to meld, because right now it comes across as slightly chunky and warm, with cassis and plum flavors verging on prune, yet nicely framed by vanilla and cedar. Try 2012–2020, although this wine has a track record that suggests longer aging isn't out of the question.
Leafy underbrush, scorched earth, tobacco, vanilla, toasted oak and spiced plum aromas lead the nose. The smooth palate offers crushed black cherry, game, grilled herb, espresso and cooking spice. Firm, fine-grained tannins provide support.
A soft, gentle medium-weight wine with attractive acidity, fresh red berry fruits and light tannins. Ready to drink.
This is cool-climate fruit, from a vintage the winery describes as “the coolest year we have ever seen.” Nonetheless they have made a good wine, with balanced scents and flavors. It's definitely herbal, but also brings some cured meat and tart, wild cherry flavors into play.
A strange wine that's not very aromatic beyond basic pear fruit and grass. Feels basic and tastes both green and oddly sweet, with a short, oily feeling finish that ends bitter. Tasted twice with similar findings.
Thick concentration and a luminous, saturated color segue to aromas of blackberry preserves, cola and black slate. The wine offers concentration and power with cherry flavors, pulpy tannins and a chewy mouthfeel.
Tangy orange zest and lime are the dominant flavors of this bright, refreshing wine. There's almost a spritz here, very fruity, crisp, finishing with spice and pepper. Screwcap.
Built around a core of acidity, this wine conveys a preponderance of cedar and sage, seemingly influenced by a softer variety like Merlot, of which it has 12%. Plum and black currant provide the fruit component, before a sizably tannic finish.
This pure, bullish, smoky Tinto Fino is full of charred blackberry, cassis and licorice aromas. The palate is massive but superbly balanced. Flavors of mocha, black coffee, bitter chocolate, toast, blackberry and cassis finish with power and precision. Drink 2017–2025.
After its rather sugary 2006 version of this wine, Maryhill has returned to a more authentic, grassy style in 2007, with the alcohol back up over 14%. It's a big improvement, showing varietal character and ripe flavors of melon and grapefruit.
A beautiful, aromatic nose of honey, orange, apricot and spice unfolds extravagantly in this elegant dessert wine. Poised tones of honey, citrus, caramel and vanilla are rich but clean on the palate, thanks to a good acidity. The wine ends with a tart grapefruit spin.
A lean wine, the tannins dominating the fruit. The wine is all bone and no flesh.
Somewhat lean in texture but very tasty and classic in terms of aroma and flavor, this wine has a unique presence. Aromas suggest rhubarb, raspberry and black tea, and the flavors reflect that complexity, too. At less than half the price of Hirsch's higher-priced wines, it has almost as much charm.
Toasty and oily smelling, with baked apple aromas for fruit. The palate is medium in intensity and round, with standard peach and apple flavors. Finishes soft, sweet and a tiny bit mealy. Drink soon.
This blend of 50% Merlot, 25% Sangiovese and 25% Cabernet Sauvignon starts with aromas of cedar, plum and hints of lemon thyme. The palate offers black cherry, Mediterranean herbs, espresso and mint alongside round, soft tannins. It's ready, so enjoy soon.
Quercus, a pure expression of Nero d'Avola, is a curious wine with quirky appeal. Its aromas are ripe and sweet and focused on mature currant or blackberry preserves. The mouthfeel is chewy, velvety and succulent and the wine will appeal to those who enjoy hot climate reds.
Nice, simple and still showing staying power for an '09. Tastes of white stone fruits and melon, and shows body and adequate acidity. Not the most citric or angular Verdejo; it's more round and easy. Finishes clean with no funk. Uncomplicated white wine for immediate consumption.
This feral, smoky Merlot-based Bordeaux blend relies on a mix of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. Red and black berry fruit intermingle amidst robust, dry tannins to make a statement of size and power.
Subtle for the type, with delicate quince, apricot and moss notes that lead to a lemony palate. Piquant acidity binds it all together in a taut frame. Off-dry. Drink now.
This Riserva shines the spotlight on the little-known Gaglioppo grape. The wine opens with aromas of bresaola, spice, leather, dark fruit and rum cake. The fresh, streamlined mouthfeel would appeal to consumers who don't gravitate toward overextracted reds.
Generous and opulent, this is a wood-aged wine in which the fruit plays a delicious part. Blackberry juice and acidity play counterpoint to toasty wood flavors and dark tannins. There is a fine, toasty aftertaste that promises good aging. Drink from 2015.
This is an average of 21 years old, making it the rough equivalent of a 20-year-old tawny Port, but in a softer, fruitier style. Brown sugar and baking spices mark the nose, followed by flavors of fig, date, cinnamon and walnut. It's full bodied and richly concentrated, spicy and warming on the finish.
Attractive aromas of cigar box, forest floor, plum and berry get this Tempranillo off to a good start. It feels crisp and juicy, with proper acidity cutting into flavors of buttery oak, raspberry and plum. On the finish it remains buttery tasting and turns grabby but also tangy.
Full of bright yellow fruits, this is ripe, rounded and already delicious. Rich mango and peach flavors contribute an exotic edge to the more mineral texture. Drink now.
This opens with a beautiful fragrance of rose, violet, red berry, new leather, turned earth and balsamic notes. The palate delivers Morello cherry, red raspberry, espresso and mint alongside astringent tannins that still need to integrate.
While the aromas are luscious, what emerges on the palate is more austere, mineral in texture. The wine has a tight, nervy character, its white fruit and spice flavors laced with tense acidity. It needs 3-4 years.
Unlike Marisco's 2015 The Ned Late Harvest, this is a botrytis-affected wine, featuring a darker color and more complex flavors. The aromas suggest Earl Grey tea and honey; the flavors resemble caramel-drizzled orange segments. A slightly bitter citrus-pith note marks the finish, providing balance.
Aromas of melon, red apple and Bosc pear immediately waft from the bouquet of this wine, while beguiling hints of toasted oak, heather, yellow flower and lemon custard dance in the background. It's quite round and lush on the palate, with bold, ripe stone-fruit flavors that transition into notes of caramel corn and buttercream on the finish.
Another dramatically layered Pinot Noir from this fine producer and vineyard, in the Central Coast. A remarkably consistent bottling over the years, and now the '09 is perhaps the ripest and purest yet, showing deep flavors of berries, licorice, sandalwood and tangy Indian spices. It's a big, powerful wine, yet never loses graceful subtlety and elegance. Should develop slowly over the next six years, at least.
A blend of Nerello Mascalese and Nerello Cappuccio, this opens with aromas of black fruit, toasted oak and espresso. The palate offers dried black cherry, ground pepper and roasted coffee bean alongside polished tannins.
This relatively new partnership's wines have been up and down, but this one gets things just right. Black cherry and plum notes are ripe and pleasing, backed by some cedar and spice nuances. There's ample richness on the palate and a long, finely textured finish. Drink now–2017.
Boasts a huge nose of blackberries and vanilla, with hints of blueberries and tobacco. The flavors capture the essence of Port in their untamed, effusive berry flavors, but in a balanced, dry wine. Firm tannins suggest cellaring 3–5 years.
This is an elegant, lean wine, with earthy and smoky notes that just barely veer into melon. It’s dry and well structured, and has a nice balance of acids, sugar and alcohol. The finish is rich and toasty.
An unusual blend of Syrah, Tempranillo, Petite Sirah and Mourvèdre, this tasty wine keeps its focus, offering up a palate-pleasing mix of plum and blueberry. There's a dash of pepper and pleasantly earthy tannins. All in all, this is a fine, out-of-the-ordinary pizza and burger wine.
Based around a magnificent neo-Gothic pile, the vineyard of Clément-Pichon has produced a fruity and only lightly tannic wine. Attractive, juicy black currant fruits are direct and fresh. It should mature quickly; drink from 2017.
Though quite dark, spicy, smoky, fragrant and seductive, this is a very flavorful wine. Citrusy acids underscore flavors of grapefruit and orange, but the core of the wine is straightforward, pure and ripe berry. It's nice not to fight the fruit with oak; the aromatics are beautiful.
A note of crisp, green apple joins lemony perfume on the nose. The palate is fresh and very light, almost weightless. A pure vein of lemon freshness persists at the core., leading to a clean, brisk and refreshing finish.
Very ripe, with mouth filling blackberry, currant, cassis and smoky oak flavors that finish dry and spicy. There's an edge to the tannins that suggests limited ageability.
Gorgeous and syrupy, this Passito dessert wine made with aromatic Moscato grapes is beautifully fragrant with ripe apricot, honey, peach and white almond. It's smooth, soft, rich and leaves a long candied fruit aftertaste.
Fleshy strawberry notes vie with Golden Delicious apple flavors. The palate continues with this competition and throws in lemon freshness. This is easy, dry, fleshy and joyful. Drink soon.
This wine is all about finesse and elegance. Aromas of grapefruit and other citrus fruits are enticing. On the palate, the wine is toasty, with orange marmalade and honey flavors, and fresh acidity.
Rather lean aromas and spare fruit flavors meet more lavishly rich flavors for dual personalities in this medium-bodied, soft-textured and slightly sweet wine.
An initially funky hint on the nose soon turns into exotically spicy notions of lime zest and grapefruit foliage with riper notions of peach shimmering through. This dances on tiptoe, it speaks of ease and joy, is lively and refreshing with a lovely lemony finish.
Radiator dust, lees and vanilla cookie aromas precede a chunky flat palate. Flavors of lime, melon and apple are as basic as it gets, while the finish is bland except for a hint of pithy bitterness.
The same Bell as the well-known Napa Valley winery, Bell extends its reach into Oregon to make this lip-smackingly good Pinot Gris. Gooseberry, melon, kiwi and grapefruit flavors swirl across the tongue, leaving a clean, fresh and very fruity wake. The moderate alcohol is an added bonus.
From a longstanding source of primo grapes, this Olivet Lane Pinot sings in floral rose and violet while offering damp earth, subtle hints of black raspberry and striking acidity. With well-integrated oak and softly layered tannins, it's on the lighter side of the producer's line-up of wines, building up steam as it goes.
This is a really fantastic white wine from southern Italy that expresses much of the complexity and beauty of the land that shaped it. It also promises a perfect pairing match to any Mediterranean fish dish—from mussels with coarse black pepper or steamed calamari in lemon juice and olive oil.
This fragrant white opens with aromas suggesting tomato vine, cut grass and gooseberry. The slender, rather angular palate offers fresh herb, grapefruit, green melon, mineral and a note of yellow bell pepper. It has a crisp, racy finish.
Dry in style and exuberantly fizzy, this fresh, fruity Riesling “secco” (modeled after the Italian Prosecco) offers loads of fresh tangerine, peach and lemon flavors. Bold acidity off sets a lingering finish of soft, foamy mousse. Drink now.
There seems to be too much wood here which is smothering the fruit. Given that, the wine does have weight and as the wood softens, the juicy fruit flavors should come through. Wait to drink until 2016. But it will always be austere.
Stemmy, baked earth is wrapped around a substantial core of oak and dense tannin in this ripe, savory wine. A wealth of baking spices, from nutmeg to cardamom, plays off the lurking layers of rich black cherry and baked strawberry, giving the taste experience an exotic edge. Enjoy through 2020.
Honey, almonds and intense acidity mingle in this off-dry wine. The acidity is still dominant, surpassing the apple and berry fruitiness. Wait until 2015 before drinking.
Dark purple in color and stunningly huge, with fresh young fruit, this is a thick, glyceriney Syrah stuffed with blackberry jam, espresso, cinnamon, dark chocolate and peppery notes. So fruity and so rich, but it's also a tannic wine that will benefit from a few years of age.
This is a rich wine that feels full-bodied and with concentration. It has ripe pineapple and tropical fruit flavors as well as fresher citrus acidity. It has also a fine texture that gives the wine great depth and ripeness. Drink from late 2016.
Clumsy, with a vegetal edge to the syrupy pineapple flavors. Finishes sweet enough to suspect some residual sugar.
This Viura smells oxidized and soft, with barrel-based aromas in charge. A soft, watery palate is resiny, tasting bready and yeasty more than fruity. If you dig around, there's some complexity and quality, but this is not the best vintage for Capellanía.
A food-friendly blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Sangiovese and Syrah, Cum Laude offers attractive notes of milk chocolate and creamy cherry over a rich, plump mouthfeel. Meat dishes or pasta al forno with a crunchy cheese topping would fit the bill.
Don Paolo is a thick and richly layered wine that offers tones of dark chocolate, mature fruit, prune, blackberry preserves and rum cake. The mouthfeel is characterized by gritty tannins and jammy fruit power.
This solid, fruity, generous wine pushes bold flavors of white peach and melon into a rich midpalate. Highlights of lemon verbena and hints of mint accompany the expected floral scents and lightly soapy character of this distinctive grape. Drink this over the next two years while its freshness is at its best.
Despite its pretty golden brilliance, this wine doesn't deliver the bubbly piquancy of traditional Prosecco. Instead, it offers flatter, broader tones of yellow apple and mature fruit. There's a sour almondlike note on the finish.
This offers aromas of violet, rose, Marasca cherry and a whiff of cake spice that carry over to the warm palate along with a whiff of toast. Tightly packed tannins give it a firm finish.
Fruit-forward and rich in texture, with vibrant mixed berry, coconut and lavender flavors that linger smartly on the crisp, medium-length finish. Best now to 2012.
This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon is a best barrels selection. It's the densest, most tannic of David Arthur's current releases, a massive wine stuffed with black currants, blackberries, anise, tobacco and smoky new oak. Best of all, it's dry, dry, dry. Fine now, if you're into young wines, but should age well in a good cellar for many years.
This wine is firm, with dry, smoky tannins that underscore its rich black fruit, promising good aging potential. It will develop slowly and be ready to drink from 2021.
Full-on style of wine, packed with apricot and peach flavors, spiced up with cinnamon, layered with toast and finishing with delicious, open acidity. A wine that shows why St-Aubin is a village that is worth paying attention to.
Savory notes of chervil combine with fresh citrus and ripe pear on the nose. The plate still has a yeasty, leesy touch and a full texture on the generous but fresh body. Slight spritz adds to the verve. The finish is both warming and refreshing, and chock full of pear fruit.
A blend of Xinomavro and the native grapes Krasato and Stavroto, this is an elegant wine showcasing aromas and flavors of plum, cherry, tobacco and violet. Mineral and coffee notes add to the poised character.
Rubber, Band-Aid and leathery red-fruit aromas open this blend of Garnacha, Carignan and Syrah. In the mouth, this is blocky and collapsed. Roasted plum and berry flavors carry a medicinal note, while this is chewy and tastes lightly herbal on a tannic, weighty finish.
Good Pinot Noir, dry and racy, with pleasant cherry, cola and spice flavors. Brisk acidity and a tug of tannins give it structural integrity. Could be more focused, but a fairly interesting specimen.
Not very Chardonnay-like, more like a Viognier or Pinot Gris with its aromatic floral, tropical fruit, citrus, melon and spice aromas and flavors. Still, it's very tasty, and dry as well, with a crisp spine of minerally acidity.
In the Haida (native American) language, Qo-ne means friend. This Cab Franc-dominated red blend is friendly enough, with sappy red berry fruit punching through the slightly herbal tannins. It's a solid, middle of the road version of Washington Cab Franc, showing the tannic side of the grape, but also its plummy fruit and hints of cinnamon spice.
This dense Aglianico opens with aromas that recall resin, nail polish remover, stewed plum and chocolate. The meaty palate offers overripe black cherry and prune alongside aggressive tannins but it's evolved and shy on freshness. It finishes abruptly, with an astringent, tannic close.
This 50-50 blend of Montepulciano and Sangiovese has blackberry, blue flower and spice aromas that carry on to the palate, along with black cherry and astringent tannins. Showing the heat of the vintage, it's also shy on freshness, so drink soon.
One of the denomination's benchmark bottlings, this fresh yet creamy off-dry sparkler opens with alluring scents of apple, exotic fruit and white peach that carry over to the silky palate along with candied citrus zest. Crisp acidity brightens the rich flavors and creates a refreshing finish.
These Dwelley vineyard grapes display bright raspberry fruit, lively acids, and a more tightly refined structure than the other Barrister Merlots. Along with the higher acidity of the 2006 vintage, there seems to be a more gentle touch with the new oak as well, although plenty of coffee and smoke flavors roll out in the finish.
Toasty oak is wrapped around some complex elements: blackberry, violets, tar, cedar, coffee and game. Big, very dark fruit, tobacco and toast flavors soar, and the mouthfeel is intense yet not weighty. Fine structure on the finish, with black-currant fruit and tar, coffee and cocoa accents. Great potential; hold two to five years at least.
There's a nice herbal earthiness here, giving a rustic and intriguing feel to this otherwise ripe, dark-fruit-dominant wine. Black plum, cherry and berry fill the midpalate, while tobacco and pepper spice take center stage on the finish. Approachable and lively now with good balance and soft tannins.
Remarkably, this is able to show age and long cask aging, but the flavor is still here: figs and honey, balanced out with burnt caramel aged acidity and a rich (but not sweet) finish. Excellent, top quality aged tawny.
Ripe, black-skinned fruit, dark spice and chopped herbs abound on this structured red. The big, bold palate offers ripe black cherry, blackberry extract, mocha and licorice while round tannins envelop the palate.
Not very expressive and weighed down by some plastic notes that weaken the clean fruit ones. Tart nectarine on the palate.
So soft and melted, it has almost no backbone at all, but there's a nice, grippy dusting of tannins, and the flavors work, so it's okay. Shows berry-cherry fruit with an earthy, dried herb quality.
Made with organically cultivated grapes, this vibrant white offers a refined fragrance of yellow flower, orchard fruit, beeswax and nut. The aromas follow through to the palate, along with mature apple and a a note of clove. Bright acidity balances this out, while bitter almond signals the finish.
A heavy note of baking spices is found throughout those of fleshy red plum, brown sugar and sweet red licorice, finishing with mild dried herbs. The bracing acidity makes this a natural for the cheese course. Try with blue cheese.
A blend of 76% Cabernet Sauvignon, with the rest Merlot, there is a sweet, cinnamon note that punches through, giving accents of spice and candy to the forward red-fruit flavor. This is easy drinking and very tasty—drink up.
Clean and fresh, this food-friendly wine tastes of pear, jicama and celery. It's light and balanced, and would make a fine accompaniment to a springtime salad or a simple fish course.
Structured and ripe with black fruits, this wine has some firm tannins along with rich, spicy flavors and acidity. The wine was fermented in open tanks a technique that gives an extra richness and color to the wine. Wood aging has added a final, smoothing touch.
Fresh and approachable but lean and focused on the nose, this wine shows chalk, wet slate, iodine and mandarin orange oil aromas. It's extremely limey and quinine-driven on the tangy palate, with the judicious acidity of squeezed lime and tangerine juice.
Dry and a little sharp, with blackberry, currant, mocha, tea and herb flavors. The tannic astringency really needs rich grilled meats to balance it.
Emiliana began as Vinedos Organicos Emiliana, but now goes only by Emiliana because getting certified as an organic winery proved too difficult. Still, Emiliana's vineyards are organically farmed, and this five-grape blend made by Alvaro Espinoza is intense and extracted yet still finely knit. It's a serious wine with slight herbal/pine aromas, robust red-fruit flavors, and a smooth, stylish finish. Not overdone, so drink now.
This single-vineyard Pinot Noir is aged in almost entirely new French oak; otherwise it is indistinguishable from the winery's Cali's Cuvée bottling. If anything, Cali's has more density and earthy complexity, for less money.
A very fine Chardonnay, bone dry and acidic, with a powerful streak of minerality that makes it rather austere. Yet there are powerful pineapple and orange flavors. It's clearly elegant and complex, and tight enough to age for six or so years. The vines from which this Chardonnay was sourced are nearing 40 years of age, which may explain the concentration.
Tropical fruit and white-flower aromas are foxy and strained. This is scattered and flabby on the palate, with pithy, lightly bitter citrus flavors blending with sweet mango in front of a tropical finish with papaya, mango and sugary melon notes.
Clean, crisp and fresh, which is enough to satisfy most Pinot Grigio drinkers. This one blends Asian pear with hints of green herbs and lemon to make a refreshing summertime quaff.
Robust and deeply flavored in wild berry, tobacco, smoked meat and spice flavors. A somewhat rustic wine that needs big, rich roasts and barbecue.
Forest floor, truffle, new leather and woodland berry scents mingle in the glass. The palate is linear, taut and austere, offering sour cherry, licorice and sage notes, framed by firm acidity and assertive, close-grained tannins that grip the finish. Drink after 2019.
Ripe and creamy wine, with some herbaceousness and yellow fruits. Layering citrus and a tangy texture, it's fruity, full of lively acidity and ready to drink this year. Screwcap.
Lovely apple fruit plays on the nose. The palate is very light and dry, but has a slightly bitter edge that suggests that this might be better with food than as an apéritif. The finish is beautifully dry and invitingly tart.
A chunky wine, this offers big, blocky flavors of oak, apple butter and melon. Round and forward, this is straightforward and perfectly enjoyable.
This is a wine that is full of red fruits and fresh acidity. The tannic structure is well in balance giving a firm edge to the bright, ready-to-drink fruits. The wine is the entry level to the always impressive range from Crasto. Drink this wine now.
Canary Hill Shines in this new vintage, with mixed and juicy fruit flavors of cranberry, raspberry and cherry. It has good grip and a well-balanced herbal note, finishing with hints of green tea.
The Wenzel family continue to make small quantities of finely crafted wines, like this intensely flavored Sauvignon Blanc. The sweetness is well controlled by fresh acidity and lemon curd flavors, while the honey gives the right amount of dryness. Age it for another 5 years.
A bright, lively wine made from Sangiovese, it has classic varietal aromas of blue flower, red berries, spice and just a whiff of leather. The palate delivers ripe red cherry accented with hints of white pepper, clove and cinnamon alongside firm but fine tannins and fresh acidity.
Medicinal aromas of berry fruits and latex are woody and floral. Flavors of plum and currant are more raw than lush, while this tastes of tomato and feels crisp on the finish.
Typically rich, this Pinot Noir-based Champagne is ripe with red apple, quince and plum flavors. The fruit is balanced by the steel and mineral edge that gives the wine a tight texture.
Talenti delivers a very impressive Brunello with inky-dark concentration and background layers of coffee, espresso, fudge and maraschino cherry. Give it more time to age so that those sharp points of firmness can soften and widen.
This is big, rich, thick wine, dripping with gooey cherry and chocolate flavors. Blended from equal parts Grenache and Syrah, it features some notable tannins, although it's voluptuous enough to drink now. Pair it with barbecue.
Fermented 75% whole-cluster and then aged in neutral oak, this wine offers complex, expressive aromas of green olive, fresh herbs, grilled asparagus, earth and peat. The palate brings waves of intensity, with sensuous, layered savory flavors that lead to a hyperextended finish. It's an exclamation point of a wine that shows the promise of this young winery and vineyard.
Sweet, spicy and floral aromas start this stylish Viognier from Cooper. The wine has some heft with its honeyed layers of flowers, spice and fruit. It's elegant and approachable…a sultry sip.
Inky dark-fruit aromas are blanketed by oaky scents that settle on caramel and vanilla. This four-grape blend of Bordeaux varieties is both creamy and acidic, with herbal notes along with spice, wild berry and leafy flavors. Snappy, crisp acidity hangs around on the finish, creating a racy sensation. Drink through 2018.
So vegetal, it's barely drinkable. Cabernets Sauvignon and Franc.
Although there is a little Merlot and Tannat in the wine, it is 90% Malbec. Still firmly tannic, it is concentrated and spicy. It has a dark dry texture that is lifted by ripe blackberry fruit. With acidity cutting right through, the wine is nowhere near ready to drink. Wait until 2019.
This meaty, gamy wine is 84% Mourvèdre, and marries its earthy flavors to the ripe black fruit of the Syrah. The two mix well, but could use a bit more bottle time to fully integrate. Blood, meat, cassis, and smoke mingle, and some heat slips in at the end, along with rich coffee grounds and dark chocolate. Big, flavorful, lingering.
There's plenty to like in this bright and spicy, all-Willamette Valley wine. Cherry fruit is lifted with highlights of hot pepper candy. A slightly smoky, slightly burnt character marks the finishing tannins.
This complex and savory wine has a noticeably gold color, rather quiet aromas of light baking spices and blanched almonds, and then reserved oak, mineral and almond flavors on a soothingly broad texture. It has good presence on the palate and leaves a lingering finish.
An interesting contrast to many of the other Hawke's Bay Syrahs, this one features red raspberries, white pepper and hints of rhubarb. It's a brighter, fruit-driven style, but one that features a reasonably plump texture and a mouthwatering finish. Imported by Southern Starz.
The Rolle, or Vermentino, has produced a warm, herbal, southern sun-touched wine. It is full of rich yellow fruits and laced with acidity. A light touch of honey from the ripe fruits gives a deliciously smooth aftertaste. Drink now.
Starts with punchbowl aromas of berry fruit, flowery scents and candy. The palate has a good freshness to it along with snap and flavors of cherry, plum and berry. Nothing complicated here; just a juicy, fresh wine that's likable and not overpriced.
Smoothly seductive in texture and body, this medium-sized vineyard designate is bright in lemon peel, vanilla and caramel apple flavors, see-sawing between richness and vibrancy. A mineral freshness emerges as it opens in the glass.
Soft and ripe, here is a wine that just enjoys being rich and fruity. Blackberry flavors are followed by sweet black cherries, both contained within an elegant structure of tannins. As usual, this will develop more quickly than its more powerful stablemate, Léoville-Barton.
This fruity Pinot is loaded with ripe strawberry preserves, mixed in with tomato leaf and slightly resiny flavors that are typical in Oregon. It's an interesting mix, both ripe and herbal at the same time, but not yet entirely melded together. It will be fun to see where it goes in the next five years.
Made with the Albana grape, this opens with scents suggesting thyme honey, yellow stone fruit and a whiff of toasted nut. The bright, medium-bodied palate offers dried apricot, lemon drop and bitter almond while a mineral note adds energy.
No shrinking violet at 15.9% abv, La Folia's Zin is exuberant in juicy red and black fruit, cinnamon spice and a taste of cola. Inviting, full and round with a softness in the mouth, the finish slips away ever so quickly. It's otherwise a swell example of Sierra Foothills fruit.
Another classic Gewürz from this fine winery, their best ever. As the label indicates, it's dry, but has an apparent sweetness, with honey-infused orange, Asian pear and litchee nut flavors, and those fabulous exotic spices that are so unique to the variety.
Aromas of lime, honey and petroleum mesh well with a hint of fresh brioche in this off-dry style Riesling. The flavor profile is a bit bony, featuring lemon, underripe nectarine and bitter green almonds, but there's a pleasant silkiness to the texture of this wine.
Though labeled Sauvignon Blanc, this includes 20% Muscat, which makes it more of a proprietary white wine than a pure varietal expression. The flavors combine grassy, salad greens with citrus and grapefruit rind. The Muscat shows up in the orange blossom highlights. As the low alcohol would suggest, this dry wine has plenty of natural acidity.
A scent of burnt sugar hits the nose first, followed by blasts of papaya and kiwi. The palate tastes off-dry, and it offers a caramelized flavor. The wine clings to the palate on the finish, which gives it some length.
Pietramora Riserva is a dark and masculine wine with aromas of blackberry, black cherry and plum backed by soft renderings of spice, rum cake and leather. The wine shows nice density that is filling without being heavy.
Here's a beautiful Chianti Classico from Panzano's Conca d'Oro, or Golden Basin, one of the best areas in the denomination. It has compelling aromas of pipe tobacco, crushed cherry, smoke and leather. The palate delivers juicy black-cherry, plum, clove, carob and mineral flavors. This wine has a beautiful structure, elegance and mesmerizing depth.
Pinched, rubbery and earthy-smelling, but with ample berry, plum and char aromas, this young, oak-aged RDD is full and well balanced. Blackberry, cassis and oak flavors dance well together, while the finish introduces hickory and herbal notes.
The vineyard is in a very cool, damp part of the valley, and this particular bottling always shows a dry finish, considerable tannins and an earthiness not found in warmer parts of the appellation. This 2008 follows those lines. It has a dense core of sour cherry candy fruit, with some superripe currants. Will age interestingly over the decade.
Soft aromas of lemon blossom, flower and citrus lead into appealing flavors of citrus, sea salt and spice. It's not an overly complex white but does not need to be. Enjoy this with grilled seafood, vegetables and fruit.
With seven years in bottle, this Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend is what it is. The nose is stewy and raisiny, with baked berry notes. Like the nose, it feels raisiny and heavy. Flavors of raisin, fig and chocolate keep the theme going, while the finish is herbal and earthy in flavor, with heat.
A relatively full-bodied, chunky red with firm tannins, this is a burger wine par excellence, and priced so that you don't feel you've overspent. Slightly herbal overtones mark the black cherry fruit, just enough to impart a savory quality.
This Riserva Sangiovese from coastal Tuscany delivers a very precise note of spice or crushed clove that beautifully frames a core of red fruit and cherry. Pair this wine with thinly sliced beef with crunchy roast potatoes.
Sautéed red cherries, hazelnut and pipe-smoke scents show on the nose of this blend of Syrah and Petite Sirah. It's tangy on the sip with pickled red-fruit flavors. It also shows fudge with cherry syrup, cappuccino and mocha flavors.
The nose of this excellently priced wine offers sour fruit from Montmorency cherries, earthiness from squeezed beets, spice from toasted sagebrush and umami from soy sauce. The palate is deep, with a sanguine character that's enhanced by lots of cracked pepper. It delivers plenty of action for the price.
Cigar, coffee and mocha on the nose, followed by smoke and tobacco on the palate, give this ageable wine a masculine, restrained edge. The fruit is soft and integrated but the structure good. Imagine sipping this one by a roaring fire—it has that kind of character.
This pure Mourvèdre begins well, offering a full palate of varietal flavors that are built upon a mix of citrus and ripe tree fruits, along with accents of leaf and forest. It turns soft and seems a bit overripe, running into a rather short finish.
Bright green fruits, touches of green pepper, lemon zest: this wine is all about primary fresh tastes. It is crispy clean, spiced with pepper and well filled out with white plums. Drink this year. Imported by Legendary Wine Company.
Soft, silky and rich, this Pinot combines a drink-me-now style with coastal elegance. It's tasty in raspberry and cherry jam, blueberry, vanilla granola and toasty oak flavors.
Lifted and floral up front, this Mencía smells like light, schist-infused plum and raspberry. There's mild grab to the palate, which offers flavors of buttery oak, rubber, strawberry and rose hip. A dry, slightly briny tasting finish fades away elegantly.
Exceptionally ripe in black cherries, blackberries, cassis, and chocolate, and sweet in fruit juice essence, although it's technically dry. Polished and smooth, with a nice edge of acids and tannins for grip. Almost too flamboyant in sweet opulence. Anything more in this direction will be excessive.
With aromas of superripe fruit, this wood aged wine has a rich, toasty and lightly oxidized character, which in this case adds complexity. It is tangy and aromatic, with pear and citrus flavors that harmonize with the spicy wood accents. It is ready to drink.
Very ripe in cassis, with plenty of smoky oak influence and a spicy, dry finish. This is a bold, tannic young wine, tight and astringent in youth. It needs time in the cellar to soften and meld. Should be best between 2009 and 2011, and live far longer.
This powerfully ripe, direct Chardonnay shows massive flavors of pineapples, nectarines, green apples, vanilla and oaky buttered toast, brightened with crisp, coastal acidity. Nice with scallops in a saffron and coconut cream sauce.
Stridently herbal on the nose, with flavors that verge on vegetal, this is nonetheless cleanly made, with enough lemongrass and grapefruit aromas and flavors to merit recommendation. Drink it over the next six months or so.
This pure expression of Frappato offers savory notes of cassis and cured meat, followed by prune and dark plum accents. It's a dark and concentrated interpretation of this grape.
Jammy berry and plum aromas are solid but sort of generic. This is fresh and lively on the palate, with a pointed, prickly overall feel. Standard berry and plum flavors are a touch earthy and finish with moderate depth.
Blended with 12% Grenache and 8% Roussanne, this direct and appealing wine suggests violets, raspberries and plum, with a vanilla top note (21% new American oak). The coffee and blue fruit flavors are rich and full, with vanilla notes lingering on the finish. It's a complete knockout for this price.
This is a toasty, black-currant-fruited wine. Its structural tannins give a dry character. A touch of green herb and a hard edge of toast indicate that the wine needs another year to soften.
Full in the mouth, this is a rich style of rosé, with delicious red-berry crispness. It is ready for food with its tangy, textured aftertaste. Screwcap.
For a simple Beaujolais, this is an intensely rich wine with toast spice coming through the black cherry fruit. The tannins give a ripe structure. All the time, the wine remains true to its fruity origins.
This is a savory and tasty wine, with smoke, red cherries and bacon fat on the nose. The mouthfeel is dense, with rich flavors of black cherries, licorice and dark chocolate offering layers of complexity, rounded out by the right amount of tannins and acidity.
Off alluvial gravel soils that have much in common with Marlborough, this off-dry Riesling features the bright, fruity notes common to the region, combining green apple and citrus aromas and flavors with a lean, chalky texture. Pretty, but not that concentrated. Imported by Epic Wines.
Winemaker: Jan Coetzee. A prominent sanguine character rides atop the fruity scents of tart cherry, rhubarb and small white strawberry on the nose of this wine. A touch sharp and acidic on the palate, it offers soft tannins and tart cherry and currant flavors that are partnered with touches of bramble and game. Drink now–2020.
There is an unusually high (40%) proportion of Sémillon in the blend, which offers the possibility of aging. Although this wine is fresh, lemony and tightly herbaceous now, it will become more rich and the flavors will deepen. Drink from the end of 2016.
Intensely perfumed wine with concentrated, ripe flavors of bitter oranges and pepper. At the end, though, the primary taste is of freshness, with a lift of acidity.
A great buy in a smooth, dry Merlot that shows real Napa elegance and style. It's medium-bodied and lush, with appealing cherry, currant, licorice, tobacco, mocha and spice flavors. Drink now for the immediate appeal.
Light in flavor and delicate in texture, a Sangiovese-like Zin from this Sangiovese specialist. Tea, raspberry and cola flavors. Atypical, but likeable.
The best things about this Merlot are its extreme dryness, tannin integrity and relative austerity. It's a pleasure to drink a Merlot that's not a fruit bomb. That doesn't mean you won't find complex flavors of blackberries and currants. You will. It means that this extraordinary Merlot is pushing the envelope on what California, and Napa Valley in particular, is able to achieve in making Merlot along classically structured lines.
Very good in the value vein, with light but balanced aromatics that show tropical fruit offset by honey and vanilla. The palate is ripe and on edge, with melon, pear and a hint of banana. Nice from start to finish. A very good buy. Imported by Sovereign Wine Imports.
A vivid gold color and spice-rack aromas like nutmeg and cardamom add a different twist to this medium-bodied and rather rich-textured wine. Those are probably characteristics from aging with oak, and they enhance the clean, fresh fruit flavors in a good way.
Rough, weedy berry aromas are covered up by oak, plastic and vanilla notes. This is scratchy feeling and devoid of charm on the palate. Oak-driven flavors of marshmallow and vanilla clash with core green fruit, and the wine quickly falls off on the finish.
This is a beautifully fragrant Merlot from cool-climate northern Italy that shows pristine aromas of cherry, wild berry, red rose and Indian spice. The wine is structured and smooth on the finish with soft, plush tannins.
Dryness and herba notes mark this wine. Despite some rich oak influences, it comes down on the mineral and sage side, only vaguely suggesting fruitier notes of pineapples and peaches.
Radiator dust, strawberry, cherry and apple-skin aromas amount to a slightly flat but not offensive nose. Likewise in the mouth: it's good and pleasant but a bit flat. Flavors of plum, berry and brine define the finish.
With layers of wood aging, this is a wine that is ripe and bold. Its yellow fruit and spice character is right up front, while the acidity and lemon flavors have fine supporting roles. It needs another year for the wood element to settle down.
Solid stuff from Sicilia, and in many ways it sets the standard for what Southern Italy can do with native grapes. This wine offers meaty, earthy fruit, cola, oak and leather all wrapped into a presentable whole. And it improves with airing. Imported by Vias Imports.
A blend of wines from 4 different vineyards to make a wine that is partly botrytised, but has a fresh character, along with raisin flavors. Crisp acidity partners the apricots. Drink with food or as an apéritif.
Ripe and tangy red berries conjure up an inviting nose, and carry into the mouth with fresh, sappy flavors. A blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot, 12% Cabernet Franc, 4% Petit Verdot and 4% Malbec, this turns a bit short and chalky in the finish.
Made with Nebbiolo planted in the high vineyards of Valtellina, this vibrant fragrant red opens with aromas of rose, wild berry, Alpine herb and a tarry note. The linear palate delivers red cherry, star anise and mineral while taut fine-grained tannins and racy acidity provide an elegant, ageworthy structure. Drink 2020–2030.
Scents of lemongrass, white flower, bees wax and pear are perky and well etched. Between the wine's keen acids and lemony flavor, this remains a bright, uplifting effort, with a clean, tangy finish.
Spicy and dry on the nose, this bears standard dark-berry and cassis aromas touched up by a lot of oak. It feels grabby and tannic, but pure, with flavors of plum, cassis, sweet oak, coffee and toast. It's oaky on the finish, with vanilla and spice flavors along with some heat.
Still young and tight at the age of 4-plus, with an astringency marked by tannins and acids and a bone-dry, somewhat scoury-bitter finish. Good, but could be in a slump at this point in time. Might improve in a year or so.
Concentrated, ripe aromas of blackberry and cassis come with an undertone of raisin. This is tannic and lively on the palate, with juicy acidity. Flavors of dark fruits are satisfying but short on depth and complexity, while the finish is compact and tannic, with dark-fruit flavors. Drink through 2016.
Ripe and pretty, with vanilla, tropical nuts and black tar scents and flavors of mixed berry jam that carry over to the crisp finish. There's no tannin to speak of, making this a good choice for lean pork dishes. Drink now.
This Ghemma—a blend of 90% Nebbiolo and 10% Vespolina aged for two years in oak—has a dark garnet color and savory aromas of moist earth, cured meat and candied fruit. It finishes with bright acidity and long notes of leather and tobacco.
This is a fantastic Barbera d'Asti Superiore with a plush, soft, velvety feel and loads of intensity that peels back into layers of fresh blackberry, cherry, spice, chocolate, leather and exotic spice. This wine carries the banner high for all the Barbera producers now experimenting with a more modern style.
Disappointing, especially from this winery and vineyard, at this price. It's high in acidity and tough in tannins, and oak just adds a caramelized sweetness to the jammy raspberry and cherry flavors. This Syrah isn't going anywhere, so drink up.
While this lacks some of the immediate appeal of prior vintages, it's a better structured wine, with tannins and a rich vein of acidity that gives a framework to the flavors of blackberries, roasted meats, currants and pepper. Give this 3–4 years in the cellar.
This tastes a little sweet and a little scouring, but it's a nice everyday bubbly. With a creamy, yeasty flavor, it offers pleasant pear, orange and vanilla notes.
This 100% Pinot Nero offers enticing aromas of fragrant blue flower, wild red berry and a whiff of baking spice. The sleek savory palate delivers raspberry, green tea, graphite and a white pepper note. Fresh acidity and firm but refined tannins provide balance. Enjoy soon.
A solid, dark tannic wine, it initially shows dry extraction. The fruit comes through slowly, bringing out blackberry fruits and ripeness at the end. Drink from 2016.
This well extracted wine is loaded with ripe fruit, cassis, tobacco, leather and chocolate-covered cherry. The wine is still young and astringent, so let those tannins soften over the next 5–10 years.
Fresh cracked peppercorn, dense black and purple fruit and a cedar tone carry through the nose of this lavish yet nuanced bottling from a South Coast winery that practices extended aging before release. The elderberry fruit is hung on a strong tannic structure, bolstered by woody cigar box, incense, juniper and espresso flavors.
A soft, somewhat unfocused wine that offers some light herbaceous character. Pleasant when well chilled.
Neutral aromas suggest peach, apple and minerality. Solid, compact and healthy on the palate, with peach and white pepper flavors. Good on the finish but starting to show some maturity; at peak level now so drink immediately or wait for the 2011.
Lively, fruity wine that is fragrant and fresh. Having no sugar and bone dry, it is as crisp as an apple. A bright mousse offers a fine fruity texture and a light, citrus aftertaste.
L'Erta is a Tuscan expression of Chardonnay that opens with a bright, golden color and spicy aromas of candied fruit, citrus, apricot, pear, honey and a touch of spicy saffron. The wine sports a bold, saturated style.
This wine is fresh, with plenty of acidity. It also has delicious raspberry fruits, the ripeness well integrated into the wine. For immediate drinking.
Four decades of experience shine on this Josh Jensen bottling, which mixes luxuriously ripe wild berries, raspberries and cola with the sharper spice of sweet clove and dried violet. It's bright with acidity, picking up licorice in the midpalate and finishing on a tart, slightly bitter note of crushed cranberry. This will sip well for a few years but is amazing now.
Unusually set in a Burgundy-shape bottle rather than the normal Bordeaux bottle, this low-sulfur wine comes from a biodynamic vineyard. It is ripe with yellow fruits and rich acidity. It has a rounded character, with an edge of minerality and light spice. This delicious wine is ready to drink.
This Taurasi Riserva shows the beautiful and austere side of Aglianico, with penetrating notes of dried fruit, wet river stone, cigar box and crushed clove. It delivers structure and enough persistence to pair with stewed lamb and potatoes, and it can also be cellared for 10 years or more.
Aromas of prune and plum come with earthy accents and rubbery notes. The palate on this Monastrell is drawing, with rubbery tannins. Flavors lean toward blackberry, dark plum and cassis, while the finish is solid but short and clipped. For a full-bodied, value-priced wine to drink with grilled meats, this is it.
In this structured wine, aromas recall meat juices, black plum, bell pepper and cooking spices. The dense palate delivers fleshy black cherry and black currant accented by black pepper, clove and espresso. Still young, it has brooding tannins that need time to tame. Drink 2016–2023.
This wine is a bit austere and tough to warm up to, with dry, leafy overtones encircling tangy cassis fruit like a cigar wrapper. Firm and crisp on the finish; try it in another year or two—it might improve with short-term cellaring.
While the nose is a touch earthy and savory, the core of this vivacious Riesling boasts spicy dried orange peels, tangerine and honey. Lemonade acidity leads a moderately long finish. It's a thirst quenching fresh wine to drink young.
Bricco Medica Roero offers beautiful aromas of blue flowers, tangerine skin and cassis berry. It's a tad softer than other expressions although the finish is tannic and drying.
This vibrant, linear wine opens with aromas of lemon-lime, pear and a whiff of alpine herb. The vertical palate offers crunchy apple, white grapefruit and a hint of mango alongside zesty acidity.
Orange blossoms, grapefruit piths and freshly cut pineapple explode on the nose of this perfumed, yet impeccably elegant Riesling. It's gossamer-light in texture, but deeply concentrated with generous streaks of ripe yellow peach and tangerine. A bristle of bitter lime zest accompanies a long finish. Gorgeous now but substantial enough to mature well though at least 2023.
A pleasant, straightforward aromatic wine which is given a dark side by herbs and a slight touch of bitterness. Eucalyptus and stalkiness don't quite come together.
With less lively mousse than some, this Moscato d'Asti delivers an elegant and refined nose pinpointed on garden flowers, white roses and hints of jasmine. These aromas are further accented by the polished mineral note that tightly frames this wine. Imported by Remy Cointreau USA.
This red starts with black fruits and pepper aromas, followed by waves of black cherry, cocoa, pepper and red berry. Rich and mellow, it's a classy sip that will pair well with duck, roasted meats.
Cured meat, grilled herb, toast and raisin aromas lead the nose of this lean, savory red. The palate evokes sour cherry, cranberry, grilled rosemary, black tea and pipe tobacco, set against firm, close-grained tannins. Give this a few more years to come together. Drink 2019–2027.
Ripe, warm and spicy on the nose, with standard red berry aromas and flavors. The mix is Tempranillo, Cab and Syrah, which is unusual. Yet the wine tastes perfectly open and familiar, as if you've had it and enjoyed it before. Nothing special but it's good and fruity.
Fresh boysenberries and a blueberry sorbet character mix with notes of minty tarragon, dill and hot gravel on the nose of this wine, from an area between Gilroy and Morgan Hill. Peppercorns are prominent on the relatively light palate, along with tobacco, espresso and boysenberry.
Made from a mix of vineyards across the Napa Valley, this pays tribute to the early days of grape growing in the region and is a wine equally worthy of recognition. Exhibiting dark cherry stone and wild strawberry aromas, the palate is complex, tannic and round, a subtle suggestion of smoke on the finish balanced by bright acidity.

This 75-25 blend shows interesting bacon fat aromas and a lot of sweet cinnamon spice. The blend really works, as the Viognier adds lift and precision to the Chardonnay, which softens and smoothes out the Viognier's rough edges.
Two fistfuls of Petite Sirah are added to the mix here, the wine a mix of black cherry and berry around soft, sinewy layers of black pepper and firm tannins. Never overbearing, this wine will do well at the table around plenty of meats.
Bergström's Sigrid is one of the finest Chardonnays made in Oregon. Racy and refined, it shows Burgundian finesse, toast and acidity. As in other top tier wines from the Northwest, the fruit has a certain vibrancy that shouts “New World.” Peach, apple and pear flavors abound.
This delivers savory aromas of wet earth, wild mushroom, ripe fruit and cherry cola. The tannic imprinting is very strong and astringent at this stage; give this 5–10 more years.
Crisp acidity saves this rather sweet, oaky wine by giving it a clean mouthfeel. The flavors are of pineapple and apple juice, honey and vanilla caramel.
A big, warm style of Chard. The nose is soft, toasty and loaded with butter, baked apple and vanilla aromas. Feels full, round and creamy, while oak sits at the forefront of the flavor profile, with toast, apple and vanilla lurking behind. Finishes sweet and smooth. 400 cases made.

A tough, stringy Pinot, tight in acids, with everyday cherry, cola and persimmon flavors. With a silky texture, it's not bad for the price.
From vines on the cool plateau above the Douro, this is a fresh and fruity wine. Light wood-aging is just noticeable, giving a little spice to the textured, steely fruit. Crisp apples and pink grapefruit offer freshness. The wine could age more, so drink from end of 2015.
Matriarch often measures up to the level of BOND and Harlan Estate itself. It is a blend of various BOND components. The '06 is a classically structured Napa blend, fat and flashy in youth, offering complex waves of blackberry and cherry tart, black currant, cola, licorice and sweet, spicy oak. There's a savory meatiness reminiscent of salty bacon. But the tannins are significant. Drink now through 2018.

Simple aromas of apple cider come with a hint of match stick and brine. This feels round and fleshy, like an unfiltered apple cider. Flavors of generic citrus and apple juice finish pulpy and round. Drink now.

The price is a bit steep for this attractive Bordeaux blend from Hungary, but it does deliver on many levels.

It feels slightly tired, but the overall structure is good and the finish lingers.
This is a gorgeous wine with enormous intensity of fruit that comes forward as cherry, blackberry, spice, leather and cigar box. The texture is soft, smooth and velvety: In Violas has the heft and persistency to stand up to rosemary-marinated T-bone steak.
Despite this wine's weight and richness, it retains a superb sense of balance and structure. Firm acids and tannins support the blueberry fruit, while savory notes of mocha and roasted meat provide added dimension. Give it a few years in the cellar and drink it from 2015–2025.
This is a lean, austere—even a bit severe—Riesling that looks to need a good five years or more to mellow. Crushed stone and citrus pith finish long and painfully tart.
A heavy, acidic and boring wine, not offering much in the way of flavor except for some bitter cherries.
For sheer palate seduction, you can't beat this rich wine. It used to be that Diamond Mountain Cabs weren't drinkable for years because of the tannins. Not so with this beauty. It shows pure, classic Cabernet flavors of blackberries, black currants, cherry-pie filling, violets and sweet, smoky sandalwood, with a distinct minerality. Although it's beautiful now, it should develop in the bottle for a decade.
Showing well with moderate aromas of cherry and apricot supported by subtle floral accents. The palate is light but full with juicy strawberry and tropical citrus notes. Crisp, flavorful, and well balanced.
Dating to the Middle Ages, this estate has produced a Merlot-dominated wine packed with dark tannins and a dusty texture that is becoming more elegant as it ages. The wine is still young and full of its concentrated structure. Drink from 2020.

A fresh and fruity wine with soft tannins and black currant fruits. The wine has the warmth of the vintage, giving some roundness the texture and stalkiness which would be more apparent in a lesser vintage. Drink now and until 2018.
Dark as night, and with such a dramatic aroma, you can't wait to taste it. Huge and hedonistic, an Incredible Hulk of a wine bursting with blackcurrants and cassis and smoky oak. Luxurious tannins make for a smooth, gentle mouthfeel. Enjoy this youthful wine now.
Bryan Babcock heads to Bentrock Vineyard on the southwestern edge of the appellation to deliver this wine redolent of red cherry, plum, mulberry, peppery spice and sagebrush.

A lovely white wine marked by savory crispness and bright flavors of pineapples, lemons, limes and other zesty citrus fruits. Finishes dry and clean, with little or no oak influence.
Here's a simple, no-fuss Prosecco Extra Dry with an interesting herbal component that recalls dried oregano or hay. There's peach and citrus fruit at the back that is carried forward by spicy effervescence. The mouthfeel is thin and tonic.
Soft, ripe and juicy, this is an attractive wine, with red berry flavors and a light structure. Not for the long term. Drink now for its fruity character.
This is an eccentric white with thick density and fatty glycerine. It's a bold, big white with aromas of apricot, pear, melon and yellow rose. It drinks like a red wine.
Smooth and pleasantly herbal, this is a silky wine with a mix of blueberry, plum and cherry fruit. It spent 20 months in barrel, which lends a light chocolate note to the fruit. Velvety, delicate and most delightful, it should be consumed while it retains its youthful freshness.
Perfumy on the nose, this is a lavishly oaked, full-bodied mix of caramel and vanilla atop baked apple pie and grilled mango. More tropical than crisp, it speaks to a warm vintage and a stylistic approach to go for the gusto.
Breathtakingly blossomy from nose to finish, this is textbook Mosel spätlese. On the palate, pristine white peach and apricot flavors are cut by a razor-edged streak of acidity. Shimmering minerality and a delicately filigreed sweetness linger.
A nice, soft Cabernet to drink now. It's mainly from Napa County, and the blend includes Merlot, Syrah and Grenache. Easy to like for its spice and fruit. From Pine Ridge.
Tart strawberries and cream are spelled out joyously on the nose, some ripe apple comes into play as well. There is a rich well of generously creamy autolysis at the core, rounding out and buttressing those tender strawberry notes. Structure and poise are inherent. This is utterly appealing and very, very moreish—despite all its seriousness.
A subdued nose leads to a very zesty palate, with grapefruit zest and crunchy green apple. The fruit is lively, clean and rather vivacious. Lemony freshness brightens the dry finish and makes you sip more.
Here's a dry, briskly crisp young Pinot Noir that offers plenty of pleasure now and should develop in the bottle. It's a big wine, dark and saturated in cherries, blackberries and red plums, with the prettiest vanilla and toast flavors from oak. Should slowly develop through 2014.
This elegant expression of the Nerello Mascalese grape grown on the slopes of Mount Etna has a lovely fragrance of blue flower, berry and spice. The polished palate offers flavors of wild cherry, crushed strawberry, mint, cinnamon and vanilla alongside fresh acidity. Energizing mineral signals the close.
A soft wine, with some herbal, pear and kiwi flavors. It has just an edge of sweetness that gives it a soft aftertaste. For drinking now.
93—95 Barrel sample. A beautiful wine, full of white fruits, citric character and concentrated structured fruit. Great green fruits give a freshness to the wine, which is fleshed out with spice from the wood.
Effusive fruit flavors and a vibrant texture make this wine easy to pair with a meal. Spicy, chocolatey aromas meet cherry and raspberry flavors while full body lends richness in the mouthfeel and length on the finish.
A clean nose of lemon curd sets the scene for flavors of kumquat, green apple, ripe mango and lemon zest. Medium bodied on the palate, this wine offers a bright, crisp finish.
From the cool Green Valley, a wine that didn't get quite ripe this year. There are citrus flavors alongside bell pepper ones and the taste of various herbs. Plenty of oak and lees makes things more complex, but it's still a lean wine that demands foods to wake it up.
Dark and a little baked on the nose, with prune, fig and earthy aromas. The palate is a bit hard and reduced, with pounding tannins, but the fruit is equally big and ripe, so it all seems to be correct. Mellow on the finish, with a hint of chocolate. Good Merlot for the price.
Loads of oak over golden apple fruit and mild tropical notes make this a New World wannabe. It's medium weight but overblown, and the flavors are fundamentally out of balance. Still, there are some folks who just want a little fruit with their oak. —M.M.
A little bit funky and unsettled when you pop the screwcap, but soon it finds its floral, blueberry base. Remains superficial and sweet in the mouth, with candied flavors, vanilla and mild oak. Highly regular; could use more concentration and density.
A marvelous Cab that seduces with lush, ripe flavors of black currants, smoked meat and charry oak. Perfectly balanced, with softly expressive tannins. Displays power and elegance.
Tough and country-style, a dry, rugged little wine with upfront wild berry and spice flavors.
Here's a very pretty white wine from Sicily (made with Grillo grapes) that opens with creamy, light nuances of almond blossom, stone fruit and citrus. Pair this wine with steamed white fish.
Another new entry into the under-$20   Oregon Pinot ranks, this one from Wilson Daniels. Oregon law requires that wines with varietal labeling be 95% the named varietal; here there is 3% Syrah in the cuvée. Tart red berries, leaf and herb mingle in a graceful, though light bottle. A nice balance of fruit, herb, acid and tannin, with a pleasing spicy finish.
Right now, the fruit emphasizes cassis; with time, some blueberries and cherries will emerge. It's still a tight young pup, closed and a bit stand-offish, but the layers of licorice and fruit, hints of earth and wood, and overall structural balance suggest lovely development ahead. The finish is just a little light.
An exquisite Merlot that really impresses for balance and complexity, and not just its ability to ripen grapes, which anyone can do. Shows deep flavors of cherry purée, mocha, cedar and Asian spices, wrapped into finely ground, sweet tannins. A rewarding red wine for drinking now with upscale fare.
Gorgeously lifted notes of mint and crushed citrus foliage suggest immense purity with the very first whiff. The palate has the same lifted quality but is fleet of foot and more rounded than you would expect. It remains slender but charms with exquisitely pure lemon freshness and an essence of tart apple. Both intriguing and delicious, this drinks well now but will evolve. Drink 2016–2024.
Made entirely from Nero d'Avola, this opens with mature plum, blackberry and cooking spice aromas. It's juicy and easygoing on the palate, with fleshy black cherry, raspberry and ground pepper hints accompanied by round, smooth tannins. Drink soon.
Glints of spicy, salty soy sauce hover on the nose above a fresh cherry note. The palate is juicy and fluid, mouth filling and round, without being heavy. Cherry notes abound and play, pervaded by freshness and held within a frame of fine, ever so slightly crunchy tannins. The finish is refreshing, bone-dry, clean and moreish.
Heavy and flat, with dull apple aromas. The palate delivers simple yellow fruit, while the finish is soft and devoid of spunk. There isn't a whole lot more to say about this wine; it's a cipher.
Tight and textured, this wine is still young. Minerality from the chalk soil gives it a nervy, crisp character. The citrus and fresh pear flavors are balanced with the bright, juicy acidity that is too intense at the moment and needs to soften. Drink from 2017.
With chocolate-covered cherry, currant and cedar flavors and tart, food-friendly acidity, this dryish Cab satisfies as an everyday sipper.
A rich Riesling, just off dry, balancing intense acidity with white currant, hedgerow fruits and a concentrated texture. The wine is full-bodied, very ripe and superbly structured. Very fruity now, this is a wine to show how well Riesling can age—give it 6–8 years.
Rich and voluptuous on the bouquet, this has coconut, ripe blackberry and leather aromas. It feels huge, grabby, tannic and supercharged, with ultradark and chocolaty berry flavors that last long on the finish, where pepper, spice and chocolate flavors sneak into the frame. Drink 2014–2021.
This is a nonvintage wine, with green, stemmy flavors that finish on the bitter side.
The best of a trio of Maryhill designates that are made from Les Collines Vineyard fruit, this reflects genuine Syrah-varietal specificity. Pure flavors of blue and purple fruit carry a strong streak of vanilla, but the density of flavor stands out.
Plump yellow peach and blossom notes are contrasted by dusty herbal and bramble notes on this slightly savory Pinot Blanc. It's a quiet wine, delicately acidic and featherlight in texture intended for youthful consumption.
A good Pinot Noir, lusty, dry and fruity, although it's a bit raw in youth. Shows rich cherry marmalade, cola, spice and sandalwood flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. The vineyard is not among the valley's best, but Siduri interprets it as well as anyone.
A blend of Cab and Syrah grown on one of the winery's mountain vineyards, this first-rate wine demands time in the cellar. Bone dry, it shows dramatic layers of blackberries, currants, plums, dark chocolate, herbs and spices, wrapped in a firmly tannic, complex structure. Has that inimitable feeling of importance, but it would be a shame to pop the cork before late in 2008. Should come into its own 2009–2012.
85—87 Barrel sample. Soft, unfocussed, round wine. It has pleasant kiwi fruit flavors and light acidity.
Made from 100% Merlot grapes, this boasts ripe red berry, cassis, espresso, vanilla and chopped mint aromas. The densely concentrated palate doles out ripe cassis, licorice, tobacco and sage flavors, blanketed in velvety tannins. Drink through 2022.
The nose and palate are smoky and waxy, with a shimmer of petrol. The palate is brisk and lemony, with hints of citrus peel, nut oil and nut skin that linger on the long finish. This dry, savory Riesling is already showing signs of bottle age. Drink now.
Pressed rose, violet, dark-skinned berry, a balsamic note and a whiff of oak-driven spice lift out of the glass. The juicy spicy palate offers a wonderful purity of raspberry and cherry flavors offset by licorice, chopped mint and pipe tobacco. Taut fine-grained tannins provide a firm, polished framework. Drink 2018–2027.
This wine has sweet cherry flavors, accented with toast and bacon fat notes. Tannins are soft, and there's an herbal note on the finish. Bring on the pasta. Imported by Brown-Forman Corp.
Aromas of caramel, coffee bean and assorted blue fruit are in the lead, with cinnamon notes providing accents. The palate is full flavored yet restrained, with smoked meat and olive flavors that glide on the finish.
Here's a Bordeaux blend that aims high and largely succeeds. It's soft and intricate despite the thick tannins, with a mouthfeel like wool. Turns flavorful in blackberries and black currants, with more feminine hints of violets and lavender, then shuts down again on a tannic finish. Better after 2012.
Ever since Tamber Bey made the switch from Oakville fruit to their vineyard in Yountville, their Cabernets have dropped in quality. This '09 is dry, tannic and uninteresting, with a harshness that makes it difficult to appreciate the blackberry and cherry fruit.
This crisp white opens with a delicate floral fragrance of white spring flower and touch of stone fruit. The refreshing palate offers crunchy yellow apple and tangy lemon zest balanced by bright acidity. It finishes clean and fresh.
Gamy, rubbery aromas mark this sizzler with major balance issues. Sour flavors of currant and lemon finish with nothing but acid.
Bready aromas from sur-lie aging are layered with notes of summer desserts—strawberry-rhubarb crumble, peach compote and lemon-meringue pie. A slight sweetness adds to the hedonistic impression. The lingering finish is hunger-inspiring.
Shows real Lake County Sauvignon Blanc character in the ripe, citrus, melon and lemongrass flavors, dryness and crisp acidity. Could be a little tamer in feline notes, but it's a pretty good wine, especially at this price.
Freshly cut quince, guava, lemongrass and key lime aromas combine with a stony quality on the nose of this vibrant, zesty wine. Its acidity is almost effervescent, infusing the palate with boundless energy, while its chalky grip carries sharp green apple notes alongside warmer touches of pineapple and guava. Those vivid flavors linger for a full minute.
An alluring, aromatic nose of apple, grapefruit and pineapple leads into creamy but crisp flavors of tropical fruit and citrus on the palate. Lively but complex, the wine offers a delicate minerality and food-friendly balance. Elegant and delicate, but big enough to handle more complex dishes.
With residual sugar at 15 grams/L, this definitely drinks off dry. The fruit is spicy and bright, rounded off with a lick of honey. Apple, pear, lemon verbena and even a suggestion of breakfast tea come through.
Red berry, toast and black spice aromas lead the nose, accented by whiffs of espresso. The palate offers licorice, clove, dried cherry and vanilla notes, while a backbone of fine-grained tannins provides support.
This rich and voluptuous wine wins one over with its baked pear and vanilla sumptuousness, etched with an apple blossom aroma. Robust and velvety on the palate, it's balanced by fresh citrus and wet stone nuances. The lifted acidity provokes both succulence and complexity.
Ripe and tropical, this is a full wine that captures the warmth of the Alentejo. The acidity offers some freshness along with the citrus edge, but the fruits are much more tropical, rich in mango and lychee spice.
This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot opens with forest berry and cassis notes, backed by rum cake, leather and tobacco accents. The palate is sharp, tight and streamlined.
This serviceable Chard has some good fruity, vanilla and spice flavors and a touch of oak. With its creamy texture, it's a nice value.
Fresh and juicy, this is a fruity wine. Blackberry flavors dominate, with intense acidity and a light layer of tannin. The wine is ready to drink.
Minty cherry aromas and a distant mineral note akin to crushed seashells set up an honest, slightly rubbery palate with medicinal cherry flavors that come with a touch of bitterness. A juicy, steady finish is fresh but straightforward.
Though the alcohol lists at 14.3%, this seems thin and flat. There's little depth to the one-dimensional, green fruit flavors, a hint of plastic and some burn in the finish.
Cowhorn wines are certified biodynamic and entirely natural. This stunning Syrah is inky black, and smells like a bowl of blueberries and blackberries. Threaded through those delicious berry flavors are composty highlights of earth and leaf. Beautifully balanced and intriguing; this is as good as any Oregon Syrah I've ever tasted.
This wine is all about herbaceous fruitiness. Made from 100% Sauvignon Blanc, it offers gooseberry, grapefruit and other crisp citrus flavors along with a tight, tangy texture. Fresh, crisp and fruity, it is ready to drink.
Now blossoming, this wine from a generally fruity vintage is delicious to drink. Poised and stylish, it shows integrated black fruit and wood, feeling balanced and almost ready. Drink from 2018.
Elderton is making classically styled Barossa Shiraz, marrying raspberry fruit with rich chocolaty overtones and wrapping them in a soft cocoon of supple tannins and balanced acidity. Drink now–2014.
Structured and still remarkably young, this vibrant wine delivers aromas and flavors of ripe black cherry, cinnamon and licorice. It's balanced with bright acidity and youthfully austere tannins that need time to mellow out. Drink 2018–2033.
Rich, thick and velvety, this has a wealth of heightened acidity to buoy the more intense aspects. The wine hails from the mighty vineyard overlooking Sonoma Valley, which will, going forward, be within the new Moon Mountain AVA. Coconut macaroon and dark chocolate mark it from start to full-bodied finish.
There's an earthiness to this Chard, reminiscent of sweet fresh sage, along with savory flavors of oranges, pineapples and vanilla. It's a nice, easy wine for drinking now.
The cool Sonoma Coast appellation is not known for Bordeaux blends, especially in cool vintages like 2010. This blend of Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon is ripe with raspberries and oak, but there's a tart bit of acidity. Its taut and elegant in style, but lacks generosity. Drink now.
Cortona is known worldwide for two things: the book Under the Tuscan Sun and wines based on Syrah. This informal expression shows great varietal character in a no-fuss, fruity style. Aromas include cherry, cassis and crushed white pepper.
Fermented and aged in stainless steel, here is a fresh and crisp Verdicchio from the Adriatic flank of Italy with characteristic aromas of chopped herbs, lime, green melon and subtle mineral tones. The wine is zesty, clean and vibrant.
This is a succulent and structured wine that's priced fairly and a crowd-pleaser to boot, a blend of grenadine, raspberry and currant that's soft and smooth on the palate with a restrained use of oak.
Very rich, with bounteous flavors of crushed ripe blackberries, blueberries, dill, black pepper and dark chocolate, with firm, furry tannins. A bit bitter now, and might age for a couple years.
Like a Pinot Noir without the noble structure, this pretty red is medium-bodied and dry, with silky tannins and cola, cherry and mushroom flavors. It has an especially nice, long and spicy finish.
Aux Chaignots is a vineyard to the north of the town of Nuits-St-Georges, which is not far from Vosne-Romanée. Its location imparts firm, dominating tannins. It is dense, with a determined structure. The acidity and fruit are there, and they're likely to show through over the next 4–5 years.
Rosso Convento is a 50-50 blend of Merlot and Cabernet made from organically grown fruit in northern Italy. This is a simple but genuine wine that would pair with easy pasta dishes or take-home pizza. The mouthfeel is firm, tight and streamlined.
This single-vineyard Cabernet is a bit less impressive than the winery's Katzrin bottling. That said, it is still a beautifully crafted wine with impressive cassis, licorice and vanilla flavors and a dash of orange rind on the nose. Imported by Yarden Inc.
Guado al Tasso is a wine that will make you fall uncontrollably in love with Italy. Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot are expertly blended to produce amazing intensity, purity and texture. You'll appreciate aromas of mineral, ripe fruit, leather, tobacco and chocolate.
86–88. Barrel sample. This is a very ripe wine, that's perhaps overripe in its soft, fruity character. It is very full in the mouth with gentle tannins.
This is a well-integrated super Tuscan blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon, although the 2005 vintage doesn't have quite the same intensity as 2004. The wine is well defined and sharp in the mouth with a tonic and bright quality of fruit.
This Grenache-based wine includes 10% Tempranillo, 4% Malbec and 2% Syrah in the sophisticated blend. Recently bottled, it's still tight, tannic, and hiding much of its fruit. The aromas give an indication of what's to come—cranberry fruit and lemony acidity, with some firm tannins.
Oaky butterscotch and baked pear notes give this lushly composed white equal parts heat and body. The apple flavor seems baked and warming on the palate, lending additional richness on the toast-laced finish.
This bottling blends fruit from several premium Columbia Valley vineyards (Portteus, Bacchus, Klipsun and Seven Hills) into a complex whole. Hints of jalapeño, bell pepper, herb and pickle barrel underlie sweet cherry and cassis; the wine is firmly tannic and tightly muscled, with a hint of barnyard in the finish.
Made from 100% Cabernet grown in the Beckstoffer Georges III Vineyard, and aged in mostly new French and American oak, its tannins are tough as nails. Yet there's a vast core of blackberry and black cherry fruit that's just yearning to break out. With modest alcohol (the official reading is a mere 13.2% by volume), it's a natural choice for the cellar. It should begin to blossom by 2016 and continue to develop beyond 2020.
This blend works in commingling 58% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Merlot, 17% Cabernet Franc and 4% each of Malbec and Petit Verdot, all from the producer's vineyard. Caramel sparks a richness against which herbal, woody tannins speak. The body expansive and full, and the finish awash in spicy clove.
This smells leathery at first, and then it turns foresty and raw. It has a blocky, concentrated mouthfeel and herb-tinged plum and red berry flavors. It remains herbal without much fruit on the finish.
On the leaner, more herbal side of the spectrum, with cherry flavors spiced with a piny or resinous green note. Finishes a bit hard and astringent, but not likely to improve with age, so enjoy it now with rare steak.
Jammy raspberry and strawberry aromas are a touch murky. This feels wide and broken down, with jagged tannins. Earthy, undefined, unrefined flavors of mixed berry fruits finish raw and tannic.
A ripe, soft wine that represents great drinking value. The fruit is fresh and easy, with light tannins and acidity. This is juicy, full of red fruits and touched by a light element of wood.
Stalky cranberry aromas are incomplete and properly announce a soupy, clumsy palate. Green, weedy red-berry flavors have an accent of carob. Tannic and herbaceous on the finish.
Modern and bulky, this has a lot of great things going on. It opens with aromas of mineral, graphite, sage and bold berry, with chewy, roasted black-fruit flavors. It's long, compact, chocolaty and spicy on the finish. Still not mature but it's drinkable—best from 2014 and on.
Brawny in tannin weight and grip, this tight-knit wine is impressively built and in tune with the vintage and its embrace of strength and complexity. Chalky texture is highlighted in tart mountain cherry, graphite and vanilla laced in clove. Enjoy best 2023–2033.
Very much in the vein of a super-oaked, ripe Chardonnay, bursting with peach and tropical aromas and flavors, but with a distinctly nutty, minerally, almost steely note and an electric jolt of acidity. Judging from the very long, sweet finish, it's got quite a life ahead of it.
Curiously thin, this wine has acidity as much as fruit, giving a lean character that makes it seems austere and, with the tannins, tough. It could round out as it devrlops. Drink from 2017.
Quite bright, sweet and fruity, with a hint of cherry candy and blackberry on the bouquet and then a juicy, fresh palate with mild chocolate, raspberry and proper texture. For $11 this wine is more than competent; it's very good. 50,000 cases made.
This Pinot Noir-based rosé offers youthful passion-fruit aromas tempered by hints of red berries—raspberries and strawberries—and even a touch of watermelon. Off-dry (7.9 g/L of residual sugar) on the finish.
Smoky plum aromas give way to a crisp palate with sheer acidity. Flavors of tomato, plum and cherry are more raw than voluptuous. On the finish, this racy Cab displays enamel-peeling acidity and a can't-miss sense of freshness.
Generic white-fruit aromas of peach and apple are slightly pithy. This feels good but innocuous, while flavors of apple and stone fruits lose some of their snap and directness on a tropical-tasting finish.
One of Italy's most iconic wines, this structured red opens with heady aromas of red berry, menthol and dark spice. Those alluring qualities carry over to the full-bodied, inviting palate, along with raspberry compote and licorice notes. Firm yet velvety tannins and bright acidity provide balance and the structure to age. Drink 2019–2029.
Very rich and opulent. You can taste how the grapes had a long season to grow enormously ripe, delivering flavors of pineapples, pears and golden mangoes. Yet the cool vintage also preserved vital acidity. A delightful young Chardonnay for drinking now with upscale fare.
This mature brut nature is smoky and stalky/bitter on the nose. In the mouth, it's lean and acidic, with little body in support of citrus and gritty apple flavors. Bitterness and white-pepper notes rise up on the finish. For razor-sharp Cava, this fits the bill.
Brander keeps trying to get Cabernet ripe down in Santa Ynez, and while they sometimes come close, it's like horseshoes: close doesn't count at this price. Even in this hot vintage, the wine has a tough astringency, and less than generous flavors. Oddly, I liked the regular '04 Cab better.
A tough wine to like. Mourvèdre needs warmth, and this wine appears to have lacked enough of it to ripen. Shows an earthy, green herb and mint tug to the sweet oak and cherries. Drink now.
This is a very friendly wine that is medium bodied, has a brownish tint to the color, slightly earthy aromas, warm fruit flavors like cooked cherries and a touch of brown sugar, plus a mellow lightly tannic texture.
This is one of the best Bordeaux blends now available from Paso Robles. Based on Cabernet Sauvignon, it's enormously ripe in blackberry jam, currant, chocolate and cedar flavors that finish lush and spicy. The tannins are strong, but negotiable with barbecue.
Mocali's beautiful riserva opens with an inky dark appearance, thick concentration and savory aromas of leather and spice that add one more layer of complexity to an already very enticing wine. At the core, it is redolent of dark fruit and cherry, and the mouthfeel is thick and luscious. The richness of the color is beautiful as is the suppleness of the wine's texture. Hold 10 years.
Dried yellow flowers, chamomile, acacia and ripe pear aromas lead the nose. The firm palate delivers yellow apple, hazelnut and a mineral note alongside bright acidity and a refined perlage.
This polished and structured Barolo presents rich fruit and floral scents of black cherry, plum and rose. The dark fruit and spice flavors layered with eucalyptus and balsamic notes are delicious. It's still young, with bracing but ripe tannins that need to soften, but this already shows great complexity.
Alcohol that reaches these levels is often a complexity killer, but not here. This is a stunningly delicious wine, with ripe, powerful and concentrated black fruits. Baking spices, tar, pencil lead, even a whiff of compost all add to the complexity and the depth of flavor is magnificent. This can age at least a decade but is delicious already!
A sturdy, medium-bodied wine, this has an unusual metallic aroma that leads to fully ripe and nearly sweet flavors like blackberry and boysenberry carried along on a smooth texture. Moderate acidity and tannins keep the texture appetizing.
Opens with soft black fruit aromas, and later orange peel and floral notes enter the picture. This is a ripe style of wine with body and heft. Blackberry, sweet black plum, chocolate and brown sugar control the flavor profile, and while it's sweet and arguably confected, overall it's a solid blend of two hearty grapes.
Structured and still dense, this will need aging to bring out all the fruit. For now, it has a dark, textured character, full of tannins and minerality. It just hints at the juicy acidity that will follow. Drink from 2015.
Gentilium will catch your eye thanks to its fancy bottle embossed with a big wax seal. The wine inside is less remarkable although it is correct and satisfying. Earthy tones of white mushroom and black licorice powder are backed by fresh crispness.
Part of what is supposed to be a global ultrapremium wine brand, Oriel's Sygnet Shiraz is a terrific effort, made with the help of John Duval (ex Penfolds). Bold aromas and flavors of red raspberries are underscored by hints of dark chocolate, vanilla and toasted coconut, and the wine is full-bodied and dense in the mouth, plushly textured and long on the finish. Drink 2012–2025.
Tasted in October, this still-young Merlot is tannic and jammy. It shows fresh primary fruit flavors of raspberries, cherries and blackberries that are a bit one-dimensional. Give it until mid-2008 to develop some bottle complexity.
Tobacco, spice and cranberry aromas mix with nutty leather and sweat. This is a tangy, choppy wine with more tomato and citrus flavor than ripe berry fruit. So even for fans of classic Rioja this will seem light, lean and leathery.
Powerful and concentrated, this is just at its peak. Ripe, rich fruit and tarry tannins give it freshness and a dry core. It's solid and serious, a dense wine that calls for equally rich food. Drink it now while it's at its prime.
Perry Creek's popular, well-priced Zinman shows off leathery, cola spice and blackberry flavors and fruit that's just at the precipice between ripe and overripe nice structure.
Opens with a sublime bouquet of tobacco, perfume and baked cherry that conveys a sense of elegance. The palate is saturated and full, with integrated tannins and flavors of molasses, licorice and prime black fruits. This is probably a denser, slightly more ripe version of “M” than in past years, evidenced by the licorice, sweetness and coffee on the chewy finish. Drink now and over the next couple of years.
A lively, fresh wine, whose wood aging has just enhanced the delicious fruit flavors of mango and pineapple. The acidity bounces up and down, vibrant and crisp. Considering its origin in one of the hottest regions of the Douro, this is impressive.
It's all about oak in this Chardonnnay. Not much going on beyond the obvious attempt at flattery with buttered toast and vanilla flavors. Maybe a little peach and pineapple candy thrown in for good measure.
Here is a brisk and fruity wine that has bright acidity and a fresh raspberry flavor. There is an attractive crispness to the finish of this bright rosé.
This cofermented field blend is 60% Tannat and 40% Malbec. It's big, black, bold and captivating, with rich blackberry and boysenberry fruit. The tannins are grainy and flecked with graphite, and there's a suggestion of mocha throughout. This might fool some tasters if it were to be tossed into a blind tasting of high-octane Sonoma Zinfandels.
An expert blend of white Rhône varieties, this mix of 54% Grenache Blanc, 22% Viognier, 13% Picpoul Blanc and 11% Roussanne balances richness with sharpness perfectly. Aromas of honey, tangerine, creamy lily, tuberose and lemon blossoms lead into a palate full of yellow melon, yellow apple, sea salt, honeydew and even mango, all hung on a tense structure.
This creamed-apple flavored wine is soft, smooth and ripe. It has a dense texture, concentrated structure and rounded corners attractively touched by acidity. The aftertaste is crisp with a fresh, clean finish. Screwcap. Artisanal Cellars, Select Wines.
A dry, streamlined wine, for those who don't like super-fruity, oaky ones. With a streak of minerals, it shows an elegant structure framing citrus, melon and peach flavors.
Bell pepper and cactus aromas announce greenness. It's also dilute in texture, with cucumber and arugula flavors. Not only is this high on pyrazines, it's past its prime.
This yellow-looking Chardonnay smells briny and like oily popcorn. The palate is both watery in feel and resiny. Nutty, salty flavors of popcorn crowd out apple notes, while the finish is dilute.
This semi-sweet Cava boasts a mostly neutral nose. On the palate, it feels like flat soda, with candied lemon-lime flavors that finish lightly oxidized and wheaty.
Getting quality Pinot Noir for $20 remains a tough trick to pull, but this succeeds with fresh raspberry, white pepper and wet rock aromas. The flavors are delicate, ranging from cherry to cedar to Italian herbs, with some noticeable complexity.
This lively, crisply acidic wine hints at toast, but goes much more for a delicious citrus character. There's a great freshness to the wine, showing some pear flavors and a fine edge of apple skins.
A wine that juxtaposes the acidity of Chenin with the richness of Chardonnay and ends up with a mellifluous whole. It is both apple crisp and melon ripe, lively and broad. And, as always, a great value.
Made by the Pauillac cooperative, this is a pleasant, lightweight wine, a surprise considering the vintage. There are black currant flavors, but the wood element is too dominant for the fruit.
The aromas show appealing notes of orange peel, mortared flowers, spice, black olive and raspberry. The palate sports ripe but silky fruit and earth flavors, showing a very pretty sense of styling.
Earth and underripe red vegetable aromas lead to watery flavors of red berry, cinnamon and earth. Abnormally light-bodied for a Cab, with Band-Aid pervading throughout.
Delicate aromas of spring flower, nut and yellow fruit guide the nose on this linear white. Delineated flavors of Golden Delicious apple and citrus fruit, accented with a light vein of mineral, are balanced by bracing acidity.
Waxy lemon and pear aromas are muddled by bee pollen aromas. The palate is light and watery, driven by a plastic citrus flavor.
From a number of Premier Cru vineyards, the wine is solid and dark. Firm, dry tannins still dominate and give promise for aging. At the same time, black plum fruit flavors show a riper side and add richness to the mix. Drink from 2016.
Bramble and brine are present on the nose, and while 2005 was a very good vintage in Rioja, this wine brings a little less than expected. It's endowed with snappy red-fruit flavors of strawberry and raspberry, and there's also vanilla and herbal notes. The feel is dry, medium-bodied and grabby, with a hint of stemmy snap.
Aromas are of licorice, plum and whole wheat. Merlot makes up just 10% of this blend, which has a smooth claylike texture and flavors of roasted meat and plum. It's approachable now, and very tasty.
Palate-pleasing toasty, vanilla-cracker and tropical-fruit flavors. Fine bubbles lend a richness to the mouthfeel; the lush, nutty finish extends deliciously on and on. This could almost pass for a French tête de cuvée, except for the distinctly almond note (very tasty at that) running through the finish.
Ripe, sweet and stylish, with blackberry, root beer and herb aromas. Bulky yet balanced, with black cherry fruit that comes at you in jammy style. Black tea, ground spices, coffee and raw oak work the finish. A dark and handsome wine, but one that isn't overly complex and is ready to drink now through 2011.
Citrus-driven on the nose, this stainless Chard brings green apple and tangy peach to the palate. A cheese-rind character lingers on the finish.
90-92 Packed with new wood, very polished wine, its tannins smooth and velvet. It has a delicious juicy red berry fruit character that shows a fine elegance.
This has a pruney character in keeping with the high 15.4% alcohol. It's dark and liquorous, beyond ripe, and finishes hot, with chalky, earthy tannins.
A curious, dirty nose doesn't help this wine. The palate is certainly better, its fruit now mature, smooth, the acidity blending with attractive smoky flavors.
This is a blend of fruit from the Montagne de Reims and the Côte des Blancs. The result is a wine that is now showing maturity while not completely losing the apricot and pineapple-flavored fruits. A taut mineral texture lies behind the richness, suggesting that this wine will age further. Ideally drink from 2018.
A Merlot-dominated wine (with 30% Cabernet Sauvignon), this is the simpler of two reds produced by the dynamic Bantegnies family. It shows good concentration, some firm, dusty tannins and fresh, vibrant red fruits. Acidity is there, but well in balance.
A restrained nose gives little away but the palate reveals very taut, shy citrus notes and lively fizzing mousse. Everything about this shows restraint but also balance and ample pure freshness. Austere perhaps, but also convincing. The finish is full of lemon dryness.
Year after year, Feudi's Taurasi delivers amazing intensity and volcanic soil aromas that are so distinctive they immediately give its Campania roots away. This boasts bold cherry, with deep tones of sweet-smelling blue flower, licorice, pinecone, tobacco, campfire and charcoal. The wine is plush and velvety on the palate and those fantastic mineral notes emerge on the finale.
The exotic notes of passion fruit and mango are so exuberant that you almost forget to pay attention to the honey notes at the core. The palate comes in with more sweetness than expected and makes the tropical fruit even fuller. The medium-sweet finish conveys pure passion fruit.
The wine opens with inky, dark concentration and sweet aromas of vanilla, cedar, espresso, hickory and smoked ham from an obviously elaborate oak-aging regime (it sees 12 months of barrique). It offers dusty, palate-drying tannins in the mouth.
Fresh but concentrated all at once with rich aromas of honey-drizzled baked apple, apricot, orange oil and ripe lychee. The full but balanced mouth offers similar flavors along with a tang of apple cider crispness and a spiced honey finish.
Smoky, pungent and earthy, with cola and plum notes that fill the mouth, then turn crisp on the finish.
CVNE must have done a strict selection in chilly, wet 2002 to get a reserva that's this sound. The nose is a lovely, traditional blend of earth, leather, coffee, spicy wood and red fruits. The palate follows suit, showing raspberry, strawberry, plum and vanilla flavors. A great, understated wine from what was a forgettable year for most Rioja producers.
From a new block of vines, this effusive, dense and concentrated wine really puts on a show. Rich, ripe, luscious cherry fruit explodes from the glass, deepening into black cherry liqueur and extending into a long, lush finish.
A rich and slightly feral quality characterizes this bottling by Steve Dooley, with aromas of elderberry, slate, fennel, dried purple flowers and raw lamb and beef. The palate is dynamic and evolving, with lavender, rose hip, tar and black pepper. It's powerful and strongly flavored, yet not overly rich.
A fresh, green apple-and-cream style of wine, made to be drunk young. It's crisp, lively and light with a touch of pepper and spice. Screwcap.
Floral in jasmine and orange blossom, this is a sultry, full-bodied after-dinner sipper, lilting in honey goodness yet light in stone fruit and layered acidity. It is enjoyable on its own but would be fabulous alongside a peach pie or apricot tart.
Sappy green apple, grapefruit and citrus aromas are welcoming and pure, while the palate is soft-edged, citrusy and full or tangerine and melon flavors. A good, honest, clean Verdejo that has sure-fire mass appeal. More solid than special, which is what you should want from this kind of wine.
A sweaty smell opens the wine, followed with light strawberry and leafy herb notes. In the mouth the wine is thin and tart, with a hard, tannic finish. There isn't any stuffing, and it lacks the elegance and precision that could take the place of mere power. What's left is leafy, herbal and astringent, but charmless. Two bottles tasted.
An expressive nose offers alluring scents reminiscent of blackberry, black currant, violet and graphite. On the savory palate, notes of vanilla and clove lightly brush over fresh plum and juicy black cherry. It's balanced, with fresh acidity and chewy tannins. Drink through 2022.
Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot make up three-quarters of this blend. Subtle aromas of baking spice, vanilla and cherry lead to tart well-proportioned pit-fruit flavors. It shows a fine sense of balance.
There's a deep mineral tone that persists throughout this plush, velvety Meritage, accenting ripe cherry flavor with granite, and hints of savory herb with dust and clay. The palate cuts rich berry flavors with brisk acidity and ruffles of soft tannins that extend the finish.
There are some ripe berry-cherry flavors in this mountain wine, which contains raw tannins. It's also a little sweet in residual sugar.
A wide, jammy nose is the greeting on this fleshy, full-bodied Cab. Additional aromas of rubber, latex and smoke give it weight and masculinity. This runs spicy and lightly herbal in terms of flavors, while wood spice, cinnamon and herbs compete with mocha and chocolaty black-fruit notes on the finish.
With decent blackberry, cherry and oak flavors, this is an everyday Cabernet for drinking now. It's dry and tannic, and the finish is clean and spicy. The price makes it a good buy.
An impressively rich, firmly tannic and dark wine. It shows less of the Cabernet Franc perfume than of its strong structure and black currant fruits. There is an austere line of minerality that shows the wine's youth. Keep this wine for 4–5 years.
Earthiness joins notes of zesty citrus on the nose of this light-bodied fizz. The palate is full of citrus and tart apple flavors, and provides lots of refreshment with its softly sparkling, creamy mousse. A very welcome bitter edge marks this out to go with food—even if it's only canapés served alongside nibbles. The finish is pleasantly dry and lasting.
Good density for a young wine. There is weight here, dry tannins that integrate well with the berry fruits and the wood. Firm, still developing; keep for 2 years.
Löwengang is one of the few Italian white wines built to age many long years in the cellar. Chardonnay is farmed according to bio-dynamic ideals and shaped by oak barrique. The result is creamy, rich, structured and redolent of apricot, vanilla, citrus cream and spice.
Spicy and savory, this is a whistle-clean, dry Sauvignon Blanc that's perfect as a cocktail sipper. It offers aromas and flavors of lemon, lime and vanilla, with bright, citrusy acidity.

The latest vintage from Gosset, this rich, intense wine is still young, its acidity showing through strongly. But it has great depth, complex green and white fruit flavors, a hint of toast just showing and the promise of many years' aging. As it ages, it will reveal more and more flavors that will stand up to even the richest of foods. Imported by Palm Bay Imports.
90-92. Barrel sample. With all the freshness of the year, this wine is ripe and soft. It has acidity and juicy black-currant flavor. The wine is spiced, with its ripe tannins well integrated.
This Pinot Noir from Araucano is an honest, scrappy wine with nice raspberry and cherry aromas backed by flavors of red plum, raspberry and cocoa. It features slightly edgy acidity and a lean body, but it's well made and delivers toasty oak and length on the finish. Encouraging for Chile's Pinot Noir efforts.
Crystal-clean, agile aromas of peach and melon are ideal. This wine feels elegant and just right, with flavors of sea brine, citrus and tropical fruits working in harmony. Peppy, acid-driven stone-fruit flavors carry a fine finish.
This is a concentrated, dark and brooding wine from the producer's well-known property, sparkling in acidity despite its intensity of weight and length. Blackberry and nutmeg sit atop a soft integration of tannin and oak. Drink now through 2020.
Dry, fairly tough in tannins and closed down now, this wine isn't an in-your-face charmer. But there's a fantastically rich core of cherry fruit that shows up in the middle and lasts through the finish. All bets are that this Pinot will come into its own in several years, but a nice cut of beef will complement it now.
Wonderfully ripe flavors of juicy, yellow pear precede everything. With a little air, the palate gives us the full ultraspicy force of true Grüner: a real hit of freshly ground white pepper, leesy yeast notes and herbal tinges of chervil, arugula and watercress, all bound up in a smooth, concentrated but compact package with lasting, savory length and a seam of freshness.
Sweet oak and jammy strawberry and raspberry fruit command this Pinot. It has a nice, silky texture, and is crisp in acidity, but tastes simple, sugary sweet and direct.
Dark and fully oaked Rioja with vanilla, mocha, char and black-fruit aromas. The body is good while the acidity is a bit high, and thus the flavors lean toward tart black cherry and zesty wild blackberry all with a robust amount of toast, spice and charred darkness.
Already throwing some sediment, which is perfectly okay so don't be alarmed. The flavors are rich and varied, of blackberries, black currants, cola, orange zest, cedar and exotic spices, and the finish is nice and dry. Could be a bit firmer in texture, though.
Soft and fruity, it's bone dry, very crisp and totally fresh. Red currants dominate this wine that has intense acidity and light zesty aftertaste.
Decadent, hedonistic, all those adjectives don't do credit to the fancy way this Cab hits the mouth. It's Renoir in a glass. Soft but firmly structured and well oaked, the complex flavors range from cassis and vanilla to mocha and gingerbread, and are totally dry. Pure Napa Cab, although it's probably not an ager because of the softness.
This is concentrated on the nose and palate, with ripe, fleshy peach and a spray of yellow flower. Dry and medium bodied, it features zesty acidity and a hint of green herb on the finish. A great value wine to be enjoyed now.
Purple in tint, with volatile aromas of pickled fruit and rhubarb. The palate feel is wet and dilute, with no real substance. Finishes mildly green, with generic sweetness as an offset.
Ripe green pear peel, soft hints of yellow plum and fresh grapefruit notes join for an appetizing opening. The palate is slender but concentrated and adds a yeasty, almost herbal touch. There is proper texture and mouthfeel, making this a wine to linger over. The finish echoes with lemony freshness.
You'll find aromas of mature black cherry, dark cooking spice, mint, leather and a whiff of espresso on this full-bodied red. The firm palate shows dried black cherry, roasted coffee bean, oak and a licorice note supported by bracing, grainy tannins that leave an astringent finish. Drink after 2020.
An off-dry Chenin, with lush notes of peach, red apple and sweet lime. There are soft hints of sweet grass and spice that unfold on the bouquet and on the finish. Vibrant acidity keeps the flavors fresh and leaves a lingering tingling sensation. An easy choice for drinking now.

This has well-integrated herb and stem components around spicy red fruits. It punches through into a tight, well-built finish, with smooth, clean tannins. Another couple of years in bottle may help to fill it out.
Hints of nut and smoke add savory tones to the concentrated flavors of apple and quince in this balanced and luscious Chardonnay. Dry and full bodied, it has sharp, steely acidity, and a finish that bears a flurry of sweet biscuit notes.
This affordable blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cab Franc, Merlot and Syrah shows plenty of color, fragrant scents of very ripe red berries and plums, and a silky layer of chocolate smoothing over the tannins. Yet it retains some lift from the acids and a hint of the tea leaf/herbal character that defines some Washington vineyards. Nicely balanced, it delivers a lot of complexity and flavor at this price.
Green melon and lettuce aromas are fresh and clean. The wine feels solid and good, and there's a jumble of baked apple and melon flavors. Yeasty on the finish, it's made entirely from Macabeo grapes.
This is solid, journeyman Riesling offering a full grapey bouquet with diesel and earth accents. Grape and mild citrus flavors play on the easy mouthfeel and the decently long, slightly mineral finish.
Fermented in stainless steel, and dry, this Gewürz's problem is a lack of fruit. It needs more concentration.

Clean white wine, with white-fruit aromas and some prickle. The palate is linear and simple, with nectarine, citrus pith and tangerine-orange on the finish. A good, basic wine with one-dimensionality. Perfect for party time quaffing.
A firmly structured wine, showing dark black fruits and a very mineral texture. The tannins are chalky, dusty, chewy. Along with all this tight structure, rich fruits are waiting underneath. Give it 4–5 years.
From the producer's estate, this zesty wine is easygoing and softly tart, a mix of plum, strawberry and leathery texture that should shine next to a pizza pie.
A rounded, powerful wine, propelled by black fruits as much as tannin. It has big berry flavors, along with a dense structure, and a firm texture. The wine will age well.
A simple, direct Pinot Noir, light and silky in the mouth, with jammy raspberry, cherry, date and brown sugar flavors.

Close to the slope of Grand Crus, Fourchaume is one of the best known of the premiers in Chablis. This ripe wine with its touches of vanilla as well as yellow fruits and acidity has a lightly honeyed character typical of the vintage. It is ready to drink, although it will be better from 2017.
Herbaceous aromas are balanced against a strong core of black fruit and berries. A touch of anise and roasted espresso beans add intrigue to the bouquet, while accents of licorice sticks, clove and whole black peppercorns carry the finish. A very well balanced wine with solid weight and appropriate medium grain tannins.

As rich and intense as the same producer's Non Vintage Brut, this is a ripe finely textured wine, its acidity giving great freshness to the red berry fruits. Grand Cru vineyards speak tellingly.
Inky and jammy upfront, this has cheesy leather and berry aromas. It feels good, with ripe tannins and a flavor profile of juicy berry and cherry that lacks some complexity. The finish is awash in ripe, powerful berry.
Out of the bottle, this Pinot feels as though it straddles Old and New World styles; it has a beautiful, minerally feel and dusty, meaty aromas. Let it sit for a while and it becomes a New World powerhouse—big, forward and muscular. Watch this winery.
A green, herbal wine, very crisp, still young with acidity, mineral acidity and a bright, lively aftertaste. The wine is tangy with citrus at the end. Keep for six months to a year. Screwcap.
Earthy in cranberry and pomegranate, this is a new vineyard-designate offering from the producer, light in texture and tannin imprint. Soft, it gets meatier and denser in intensity through the finish, with a backbone of acidity and grip.
According to winemaker Eric Fry, the big reason for the quality of this wine is vine age-a venerable (by LI standards) 22 years. This is a big, dense wine pumped full of black cherries and capped off by hints of cedar and coffee. Right now it's more about potential than pleasure-try to hold a bottle or two for five years.

Made from organically farmed fruit, this easygoing Nero d'Avola offers juicy blackberry and sour cherry lightly framed by a white pepper accent. It's simple but well-made, with bright acidity. Pair it with summer salads or pizza.
Chenin Blanc is a difficult variety to get right in California, but few wineries do it better than Foxen. They have a solid track record, going back for years, of wrestling the wine's difficulties into elegant submission. With the 2012 vintage, Foxen has crafted one of their best ever. It's dry, moderate in alcohol and crisp in acidity, with complex peach, citrus, green apple, wax bean and herb flavors.
Albana di Romagna is a little-known white wine from central Italy that offers much of the same fresh appeal of more popular and commercial Italian whites like Pinot Grigio. This expression is bright and crisp with pear and stone fruit.
Despite its young age, Barolo Bussia Munie already shows signs of age and evolution: the fruit is on the dried or candied side and the oak tones are dusty and well integrated. This wine shows harmony and class, with tight-drying tannins on the close.
The Cabernet in this blend is Cabernet Franc, making it a Right Bank Bordeaux-style blend, at an astonishingly low price. Tart berry fruit and some stiff tannins suggest that a bit more bottle age may help to soften it; there are already some pleasing suggestions of barrel toast that run through the aromas and on into the finish.
This wine is sharp and minty, with wintergreen flavors accompanying the riper blackberry and currant. That tartness gives this blend of Merlot, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon a dry bite. Drink now.
This is the kind of Pinot Noir that has made the variety the enormous success it is.

Shows true Santa Lucia terroir, and could age for 4–6 years.
A sweet edge of sugar lines the fruit on this Chard, making the tangerine, peach, pineapple and oak flavors taste more like a dessert wine than of a dry table wine. In its favor, the wine is crisp and clean.

This light-bodied, assertive Sauvignon Blanc exudes classic aromas and flavors of fresh herb and snap pea, helping it taste crisp, dry and true to type.
The reserve seems to have spent more time in barrel, bearing a chocolatey finish, but otherwise it is quite similar to the Marryhill's regular Sangiovese. Slightly higher alcohol makes for a bit more concentration of the strawberry fruit, but the herbal, peppery bite is still there in the finish.
Stature is K-J's top Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend, and can come from any of the winery's vineyards. The '03 hails from Atlas Peak, Mount Veeder and Knights Valley. The wine is immaculate and impeccable, with impressive black currant, cedar, pencil lead and smoky vanilla aromas and flavors that finish with a great deal of complexity and interest. So balanced, so lush, it just dazzles. Drink now through 2012 or thereabouts. Winery only.
Shows good blackberry and currant flavors, but there's something off in the mouthfeel. It's a sharpness, a rugged, tart green chlorophyll feeling that suggests unripe tannins.
Fulfills one of the main tenets of California Syrah, which is to feel velvety and vital in the mouth. The vineyard is better known as a source of Pinot Noir, and its cool-climate terroir lend brisk acidity, firm tannins and a cured meat note to the ripe blackberries and currants. Very delicious, and the price is great for the quality.
Opens with aromas of burnt leaves, roasted bell pepper and tomato and finally secondary red fruit. The palate is saturated but hard, with herbal, leafy, dry red-fruit flavors and a backing of cured meat. Herbal late, with some old-school cherry and tobacco. A tough wine, but at least it's something different.

A red fruit driven wine that appears more linear and less jammy than other Sicilian Merlots. Aromas of tobacco leaf, pencil shaving and cedar wood back a spicy, medium texture in the mouth.
Ben Ryé can claim to be both a cult wine and a commercial wine, and that's a very difficult goal to achieve. Sweet, syrupy and crisp at the same time, this Sicilian dessert wine opens with a luminous amber color and intense aromas of prune, dried apricot, honey, caramel and custard cream. It's seriously delicious.
The Escarpment style is always one of ample ripeness, weight and structure, and the 2009 measures up to the winery's previous successes. Plummy fruit is tinged with a dark chocolate note, while the palate is richly textured, and the finish is long and velvety. Drink now–2018.
After initial aromas of char, gritty leather, asphalt and tar fade, you get mature, herbal cherry and plum scents. This gran reserva is delivering light, racy, tangy flavors of raspberry and strawberry along with vanilla. On the finish, this is subtle, elegant and pure. Drink now through 2024.

Easy, fresh and simple, this opens with aromas of dried hay, stone fruit and honey, offering a thick, creamy feel on the palate. There's a touch of fruit on the close.

This is a young, tight wine. It stuns with strong acidity and a bitter lime zest, almost gooseberry tartness. But it's nobly structured, and badly in need of a year or two in the cellar, or extended decanting. Oxygen and warming up bring out exciting notes of tropical fruits, buttercream and oak.
Deep purple in color, with a dense, compact bouquet showing ripe blackberry, density and heat. Full-force on the palate, with drying tannins along with prune, blackberry, licorice and peppery flavors. Serious and tannic, with richness, extract and power.

Merlot, Cabernet and a splash of Syrah are brought together in solid, inspiring fashion by this Catalonian winery.

Hailing from a single-vineyard block planted in 1979, this wine is aromatically reticent with notes of pear and flowers. It drinks off dry with stone- and tree-fruit flavors.
This wine's cherry-berry flavors also convey a slightly green, underripe character. It's a medium-bodied Shiraz, finishing tart and a bit hard.

Sirica is a newly discovered grape variety that is said to have genetic ties to Teroldego, Syrah and Refosco Friulano. How it ended up in Campania is anyone's guess.

Starts with distinct, hard aromas of mustard, horseradish and jerky. In the mouth, it's full, bullish and tannic, with flavors of bacon, wood resin, smoke and stewed blackberry. Very smoky and dark, with hard tannins, and just not as good as past vintages.
Winemaker: Sebastian Beaumont. Initial aromas of barely ripe honeydew, green plum and lime pith are assertively laced with hints of fynbos and salinity on the nose. The palate is fresh and zingy, with green plum, apple and citrus fruit flavors that persist through the finish. A nice evolution unfolds on the close, transitioning from lively green fruits to citrus peel and finally ending on a subtle oaky-spice accent. It's young and nervy now, but should show more nuance and elegance with time; enjoy the ride through 2021.
Aged in steel, this vibrant wine shows Nebbiolo's more elegant and youthful side. It weaves together rose, violet, perfumed berries, bright cherry, crushed raspberry and sweet baking spices alongside supple tannins and fresh acidity. Enjoy it soon to capture the crunchy berry flavors.
A little raw in acids, but with some jammy cherry and blackberry fruit, and pretty dry. Drink this rustic wine with anything calling for a full-bodied red.
Here's a rich, ripe expression of Barbaresco with loads of bright fruit followed by generous notes of exotic spice and scented candle. The wine is smooth, rich and drinkable almost immediately. Or, you could safely cellar this wine five years or more: the natural fruit promises to evolve evenly   over the years.
Cuts an elegant profile, with its ripe blackberry fruit and judicious use of oak. Supple and even, it shows good balance. The pepper, chocolate and licorice-tinged finish is long, with fine tannins. It's a big wine, but not awkward, showing depth and style.
Oak and resin aromas are overpowering and dominant. The wine is big and woody in the mouth, so much so that it almost collapses upon itself, leaving resiny flavors of melon and underdeveloped citrus. Flat on the finish.
This wine has a muddy aspect to the nose. The palate is fresh and sprightly but a little dilute and derives its fruit from a light, refreshing lemon note.

This energetic sip starts with aromas of pear, flowers, a zing of minerals, then follows with a fresh combination of lemon zest and honey on the palate. A floral, citric finish adds to the appeal. A fantastic wine for grilled seafood or poultry dishes.
Very open and ripe, touched with wood and centered around some creamy red apple and green pear flavors. The wood comes through strongly later, leaving a powerful vanilla aftertaste.
Rough, almost harsh aromas of petrol and sauerkraut are less than inviting. This is bland and soft in feel, with almost no spritz or lift. Innocuous flavors of melon, papaya and honey finish flat and sugary.
Solid and anchored in darker flavors of earth, leaf and tannin, this well-made Pinot Noir shows black cherry fruit at its core. The best part is the nose, promising some development in bottle. Aromas are elusive and elegant, but in the mouth it turns a bit tannic and rough.
Despite its Washington-designated label, this blend of 45% Grenache, 40% Syrah and 15% Mourvèdre all comes from Lonesome Springs Vineyard in the Yakima Valley. The aromas of coffee, cherry, red apple and peppery spices are generous, while the palate is full and creamy in feel, with the texture providing much of the appeal.
The small Beaujolais cru of Chénas is next door to Moulin à Vent. As this wine shows, it has the same firm structure and ripe fruit. The wine from the cru's chateau is dense, smoky and has plenty of firm tannins. It is a wine to age, so drink from 2019.
Fresh and balanced, this offers aromas of Spanish Broom, pear and a whiff of flint. The elegant, linear palate delivers crisp apple, nectarine zest and a mineral note alongside bracing acidity.
If you don't mind a bit of herbal character, this is a nice, easy drinking Syrah with raspberry and cherry aromas and timidity as opposed to a forceful attack. Zesty berry fruit rules the palate, which finishes in round, roasted form. Nice but sort of generic.
This Zin is made from a combination of four of Newsome-Harlow's vineyard sources, including Locke, Big John's, Dalton and Shake Ridge Ranch, the latter three of which are all single-vineyard bottlings, and incorporates 12% Petite Sirah. It's solid, with pretty raspberry flavors and hints of spice and admirable acidity. A little sweeter and tighter than the winery's single-vineyard efforts.
Pungent and snappy up front, with grapefruit and nettle aromas, this is classic Leyda Sauvignon Blanc on the bouquet. On the palate, this is fresh, juicy and upright. Well-cut flavors of green pea, lime and tangerine finish pithy and firm.
Opens with a mix of minerality, citrus and powdery white fruit scents. The palate packs tang and zest, while the flavors of green apple and lemon are lean, crisp and citric through the finish. Fresh but a little sharp and monotone.
Steely yet somewhat sweet, it offers a richness of baked apple and pear amid midweight layers of softened tannins.
Here's a sweet white wine (the term Amabile refers to the high sugar content) that opens with compelling notes of honey, acacia flower, peach and yellow candy. It's hard to imagine what to pair it with: It could either go with fruit salad or salty crackers with cheese.
This wine is a blend of 79% Cabernet Sauvignon, 13% Malbec and 8% Petit Verdot from Seven Hills, Loess, Mill Creek Upland and Serra Pedace vineyards. Aromas of fresh herbs, scorched earth, mineral, and red and black fruit—slightly dried-out-seeming—lead to a silky textured concentrated palate. The tannins are there but are beautifully integrated. It shows plenty of hang time on the finish. It should have a good 15 years in front of it. Best from 2024–2030.
This is an elegant, streamlined Amarone with sharp notes of cherry, blueberry, exotic spice, toasted almond and cola. It's tight and raw in the mouth with good power and density.
A lovely wine that makes the case for bottling Cab Franc on its own. Shows beautifully ripe, fine Napa tannins with complex flavors of red cherries, red currants, licorice, cola and cedar. Think of it as a Cabernet Sauvignon that's lighter in body and more elegant.
Le Origini delivers generous aromas of ripe fruit and blackberry jam followed by spice, leather and a touch of black road tar. It closes long, sweet and dense and would pair with spicy lamb stew or curried meat specialties.
Shows more gooseberry and feline notes than previous vintages, but there's still enough sweet spearmint and pink grapefruit flavor to satisfy. The acidity is lovely and mouthwatering.
A smooth, perfumed wine, with an initial barnyard character that then softens into red fruits and soft tannins. Relatively light, going more for juiciness than weight.
Notes of sweet vanilla and biscuit crumbs add a warm, sweet touch to the nose and palate of this elegant Bordeaux-style blend. Bright acidity accentuates the flavors of tart red plums and raspberries along with a flurry of fine-grained yet penetrating tannins that linger.
With a majority of Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend, the wine is finely structured and filled with intense black fruits. It has a dry core that will allow it to age slowly and gently. The wine has juicy acidity, a tightly tannic core and great potential. Drink from 2021.
After an early aromatic blast of sulfuric matchstick, this turns for the better while providing scents of citrus, fresh-cut grass and minerals. The palate is zesty, with briny flavors of nectarine and orange. A minerally, slightly salty finish keeps this on course.
Sweet peas and gooseberries put a subtle mark on this full, soft wine that's only mildly herbaceous. The residual sugar is just at the threshold of perceptibility, imparting greater weight without making the wine taste sweet.
A cool, neutral wine that smells as much like mountain stream water as it does white fruits. Flavors of green apple and underripe nectarine are dry, clean, quiet and refreshing. Shows a mild almond-skin bitterness on the finish, but overall it's much like a good Viura from Rioja, Spain.
Crisp nectarine and apricot aromas meet hints of butter and lime in this clean and easy appellation blend from seven vineyards and four counties. The flavors are also familiar and pleasant, with key lime and lemon peel and a building acidity that carries those flavors deep into the finish.
A beautiful wine, from a winery that's piling up an impressive track record. Made from all five classic Bordeaux varieties, this 07 shows the balance of the vintage, with gorgeous tannins and focused characteristic of a mountain vineyard. The blackberry and black currant flavors have a firm minerality. Best now for its soft lusciousness, and should hold in the bottle for a good six years.
This wine from a Loire Valley clone is light in the glass and reductive at first, showing dried grass and sour green apple skin scents on the nose. That grassiness comes through on the palate too, until more rounded stonefruit pops on the midpalate. Prominent acidity carries those flavors into the finish.
Made from 100% Pecorino, this offers floral aromas of acacia and jasmine. On the palate, it shows tropical fruit flavors of pineapple and banana, accented by notes of thyme, mint and a hint of vanilla.
This is a variety Gerovassiliou does very well, with its aromas of pear, peach and lemon and its creamy but crisp flavors of pear, citrus and peach. The wine has weight without losing its delicate touch, and balanced acidity gives it a food-friendly edge. A great summer white wine.
Starts with interesting aromas of seared meat, blackberries and oak, and immediately turns rather tannic and sharp in the mouth. There's some nice purple stone fruit, and the finish is bone dry.
Ripe, sunny cherry pie, red currant and licorice flavors mark this dry, silky Pinot Noir. It shows the full-bodied character of Nielson Vineyard, along with the crushed hard spices that make the wine so savory. Drink now–2015.
From the celebrated 2004 vintage, this expression of Barbera offers solid and correct aromas of ripe fruit, raspberries, wet earth and leather. The wine is bright and incredibly generous in terms of intensity and purity of the fruit flavors.
Initially this one seems very dry, then richer black fruits come through, providing some weight. It finishes deliciously fruity.
Fruity, big, ripe wine, its tannins enveloped in the ripe forward fruit. There is sweetness here from black figs and berries, while red berries give acidity. Will it age? Yes, there are tannins to put it on the long road.
Dry, tannic and acidic, with some green minty flavors. Shows a sharpness and lack of generosity despite some good blackberry fruit and oak notes. Ready now.
In any given year, one or the other of Trignon's varietal cuvées excels, and 2013 is a Marsanne year. The delicate aromas of white pepper and spring blossoms immediately intrigue, and the flavors don't disappoint. This wine is floral, spicy and fruity all at once, with a long, mouthwatering finish. Drink now.
From 130-year-old vines, this is a densely layered, bigtime Zin. The flavor concentration is just tremendous, a critical mass of briary, wild blackberries, black currants, dark chocolate, licorice and fabulous Asian spice. True, the alcohol is on the high side, but the wine finishes balanced and dry. Will take up to 10 years of cellaring.
The two grapes here are more commonly found in the Douro. Here in the south of Portugal, they give a softer character—less mineral more ripe apple and pear fruitiness. The aftertaste does keep the delicious wine bright and lively.
From a warm vintage, this Syrah is raisiny and jammy up front but more staunch and structured as it opens. Aromas of baked fruits arrive at a big, saturated palate full of blackberry, vanilla and coconut flavors. Cherry, chocolate and graphite work the finish on this ripe, warm wine. Drink through 2016.
Raw-cut wood, vanilla, herbs and hard spice scents define the nose on this quality Carmenère. In the mouth, tomatoey acidity is offset by weighty berry fruit and creamy oak. Flavorwise, this is saucy, meaty, a touch stewy and herbal, just like the variety is known to be.
This opens with dry, traditional Tempranillo aromas of cherry, plum, tobacco and even some asphalt and woodsmoke. The palate is smooth and loamy, with mild tomatoey acidity keeping things fresh. Wiry cherry, plum and baked flavors finish with mocha and stewed notes. Drink now.
Tart flavors of sour cherry and cranberry add dimension to a mouthfeel that is characterized by balanced acidity, soft texture and creamy foam. The wine would make a great companion to buttery foods.
The nose on this Viognier is a touch off and slightly green, and on the palate, thin flavors lack the curvy allure of the variety. Still, the wine has a clean character and overall easy drinking quality that recommends it.
This concentrated and lush wine opens with notes of black cherry and berry, with supporting accents of baking spice, toast and cigar tobacco. It's velvety and filling, but with good grip and a solid structure to keep the palate focused and centered. An herbal accent lingers through the finish; drink now-2018.
An exuberant fruit nose leads this classic Chardonnay from Radford. The wine offers buttery and smooth flavors of toast and fruit on the palate and will please fans of bigger Chardonnays. A lingering finish adds to the depth. Pair with opulent dishes like lobster or steak.
Preda is a solid and dense expression of Barolo with oak-related notes of vanilla and spice that need a few more years to integrate fully. The quality of the fruit is evident and with 10 more years of cellar aging all those elegant Nebbiolo aromas of licorice and white truffle should shine through.
A white Bordeaux blend, handsome and richly accented with scents of toast and honey, the lemon drop fruit flavors are framed with lively acids. Quite delicious, beautifully balanced and despite its youth drinking quite well.
Coming from the oldest block of the oldest Syrah vineyard in the state (1986 plantings), this wine brings a pleasing assortment of herbs, blue plum, mineral and spice along with a kiss of smoked meat. It's focused and rich with densely packed fruit flavors and tannins that show a surprising amount of heft. Best after 2017.
Stone fruit and grapefruit flavors are plump and concentrated in this incredible value wine, but pierced by a streak of revitalizing lemon and lime. It's delightfully fruity and forward, but finishes long with just a murmur of white-tea tannins.
Opaque and thick in color, this bombastically powerful and concentrated wine has pruney sweetness lurking on the back palate, softened by sprinkles of vanilla and black pepper atop a sturdy helping of blackberry pie.
This is a ramato Pinot Grigio (which means “copperish” in color) that boasts pinkish highlights of peach and amber. The wine delivers a steady stream of pear, cranberry and citrus aromas and washes clean over the palate thanks to its lively acidity.
Moderately aromatic, this has notes of woodspice, dill, fruit leather and cherry. It's medium bodied with firm tannins and tart cherry and chocolate flavors that carry through the finish.
Spicy cracked peppercorns, light tar, fresh picked lavender and light purple fruits show on the savory nose of this bottling. More strong pepper notes show on the palate, as do tart elderberries, sesame, soy and hoisin elements, with a nice smoked meat character adding to the delicious complexity.
This flavorful, appetizing wine would be perfect with a wide variety of foods because it's so fruity and clean. The freshest, ripest peaches and nectarines float out of the glass, with similar fruity flavors; meanwhile, crisp acidity makes the wine bright and zingy. No wood mars the bright, pure flavors, which finish with a trace of almond-skin bitterness.
A structured, elegant and concentrated wine. It is dominated by tannins, by its mineral structure and its black currant fruit. There are juicy acidity, firm tannins and a great sense of style. Still young from a fine Douro vintage, it needs several years to mature.
This is a seriously good Pinot. It's easy to imagine drinking it at a great restaurant, with a fabulous steak. The tannin-acid structure is just perfect, and the texture is silky. Yet tasted at the age 18 months, it's a bit heavy in jammy cherries and raspberries, which suggests aging. Try holding off until 2011–2015.
This lightly sparkling red is earthy and tensely acidic. With its red currant fruit, mouth-filling acidity and tight tannins, this is meant to pair with oily foods—especially fish.
This is a Barossa wine, so there's a sense of warmth and sweetly ripe fruit, yet it's also Cabernet, so that's coupled with a sense of restraint and traditional cassis and cigar box notes. The tannins are soft, yet the wine finishes on a tart note. Drink now.
A pretty, pale salmon hue, this fresh and quaffable rosé brings watermelon and strawberry flavors, lifted with clean acidity and a lick of minerality. A burst of cherry fruit comes out in the finish.
A blend of four Bordeaux varieties with 25% Zinfandel, this wine shows its origin in the soft texture and raisiny midpalate. It's a plushly pleasant, full-bodied, tannic wine with Cabernet-esque qualities, while that Zin adds a wild, brambly, spicy note.
This is a big, meaty wine that wears its youthfulness on its sleeve, showing a touch of reduction and assertive oak. Beneath its wall of ripeness, black licorice, cherry and pomegranate characteristics are buoyed by a depth of thick tannin.
This crisp, tangy wine is packed with citrus flavors. Brightly textured with a mineral edge, it is fruity, hinting at spice along with a floral, fresh character.
Kind of vegetal, with a bell pepper edge to the blackberries. The wine is also quite tannic. The combination makes it astringent.
Sticky-resin aromas are derived directly from the barrel. This is cloying in feel, with heavy oak flavors and oily tropical-fruit notes.
Soft and cloying, this wine has medicinal cherry and chocolate flavors.
This is bold and assertive, yet mellow. Dominated by Cabernet Sauvignon, it shows the house style of soft approachability and complexity, offering tiers of blackberry, currant, sage, dried herb and smoky oak. Drink now–2015.

Bright yet concentrated notes of plum, blueberry, cherry and soft bramble grace the nose and palate of this ripe wine. Straightforward, yet juicy and attractive, this is medium weight with a vanilla-kissed finish. Mevushal.
Smells both nutty and warm as well as citric and sharp. The palate keeps that pace; it's citrusy and cidery in feel, with orange, banana and spice flavors. Finishes quick and a little heavy. 70% Chardonnay and 30% Sauvignon Blanc.
This polished, un-oaked Riesling shows the variety's petrol note riding high over citrus and honeysuckle flavors. It's off dry and brisk in acidity. With alcohol of 12.5% by volume, it's a lovely, delicate wine to drink now.
Shows cherry, cola, cocoa and coffee flavors wrapped in nicely balanced acids and tannins, with a pleasant mouthfeel through the finsh. This is a dry, very nice, coastal Pinot Noir, silky and elegant.
Soft, cushioned, apricot-scented ripeness plays on the palate, with edges of yeastiness, spritz and fresh citrus buffered by plump apricots. This is gentle, fresh and pleasingly long, always with the scent of apricot.
Cúmaro Riserva is a gorgeous wine that offers rich notes of ripe fruit and chocolate, followed by leather, tobacco and exotic spice. Its smooth chocolate richness that sets this wine apart.
A rich, smooth and spicy Chardonnay, very minerally and crisp, with flavors of wet stone, peach, citrus, white pepper and smoky wood. Feels tight and elegant and complex in the mouth. More food friendly than some of the creamier, sweeter Chards out there.
Deliciously fresh, this is almost delicate, certainly elegant. There is great balance here, the wood just lightly toasty over the smooth, creamy white fruit flavors. For a wine from a lesser Burgundy appellation, this is impressive.
This is a soft, ripely fruited Sauvignon Blanc, embued with hints of passion fruit and lime. It's plump and medium bodied, round on the palate, then tart and lingering on the finish. Drink now.
A beautiful sparkling wine, rich and refined in the mouth, with creamy flavors that show ripe, sweet California strawberries and limes. This bottling gets better and better with each new release.
Not particularly complex, but does a nice job with its cola, cherry, spice and vanilla flavors that drink soft and crisp. It's an easy Pinot that will be good with a wide range of food.
Briny cherry and raspberry aromas offer up a note of tire rubber. Muddled cherry and berry flavors finish short, and overall this wine lacks character.
Citrus and high toast aromas lead to a wine that is balanced, even if the toast element is slightly burnt. There are good fruit flavors, though, bringing sweet red apple juice and kiwi together with yellow plums. Give this wine a year.
Smells like cheap Port, tastes harsh and aggressive, with cherry cough medicine flavors.
This isn't the greatest Long Meadow Ranch Cabernet ever, but it is a very fine wine, considering the cool vintage, and shows the winemaker's ability to play with the cards he was dealt. The wine is dry, with rich tannins framing blackberry, currant and cherry flavors with earthy hints of sage and tea. Drink now–2018.

Gorgeously ripe fruit, full of pear, green plum and exotic spices. The wine is rich, with its smooth, rounded texture that is pierced with mouthwatering acidity and laced with steeliness. This is a wine with considerable aging potential.
A well-rounded, five-grape Bordeaux-style blend, the emphasis here is on forward-fruit flavors that mix tart berry with lemon and orange-tinged acids. It's made for near-term drinking, a most pleasant wine, though without the gravitas for long cellaring.
This is a satisfying Syrah with profound notes of white pepper that ease smoothly from the nose to the palate. Beyond savory, earthy characteristics, there is also bright raspberry too. Priced fairly, there's no reason not to give it a try.
This cool, mineral-textured wine has crisp fruit. It is refreshing while still tight, with a firm structure. It likely will remain nervy, taut and dominated by citrus. Drink from 2017.
All Chardonnay, this wine brings aromas of the underside of a pineapple along with apple and tropical-fruit notes. The flavors show the warmth of the vintage and bring a bit more sweetness than often seen on a brut.
Impressively dense, dark flavored wine, very rich and quite extracted. But it still keeps the elegance and some of the freshness of 2004, and there is plenty of blackberry flavor to push the wine along. Heavier than many 2004s, it still shows that great acidity.
A savory, fresh nose suggests all manner of green earthy things: wet moss, ferns, green pear and the slumbering power of ripe Conference pear. All of these appear on the zesty, fresh and light but full-flavored palate. The inherent savoriness makes you want to sip more and more.
Barolo Bricco delle Viole is a lush and generous wine with a bright ruby color and attractively intense aromas of cherry, wild berry, nutmeg, clove, powdered licorice and root beer. The oak influence is still obvious at this early stage, but will no doubt integrate with time. The mouthfeel is exceedingly soft, smooth and velvety. You don't need to wait too many years before uncorking this bottle.
Dry and crisp, with peach and citrus flavors and a touch of oak, this wine benefitted from a cool growing season in usually hot Paso Robles. It has the acidity of a true coastal white wine.
91-93 Barrel sample. Initially, this wine seems very soft, the ripe fruit just floating. But it is all suppressed at this stage, and suddenly you taste the tannins and the power that is held back.
Penetrating tones of stone, lemon and wax lend a stately feel to this dry, intensely mineral Riesling. It's full-bodied in style with a rich, rounded mouthfeel, but invigorated with acidity on the finish.
This is a luxuriously fruity wine to drink now with fancy beef dishes. Mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, it shows a juicy softness framing blackberry, cherry and oak flavors. Give it an hour in the decanter to aerate and develop.
One of Testarossa's best 2011 Pinot Noirs, of 14 released, this wine is, in a word, gorgeous. First off is the silky texture, as airy as a cloud. Then there are the flavors, complex and lush in raspberries, cherries, brown sugar, cinnamon and oak. The wine is so delightful to drink now, you might miss out on cellaring it until 2018 to see where it goes.
This delightful wine has aromas of dried violet, cocoa powder and cherry juice, with flavors of fresh cherry juice, dried herbs and pomegranate. It is balanced and has a touch of acidity in the finish.
This is a well-made wine, supple and soft with velvety, integrated tannins and a relatively light body and sense of power. Chocolate and brown sugar play off of black cherry and cassis for a richness that never becomes cloying.
Peach, canned tropical fruit and white flower aromas are pristine on the nose. The medium-bodied palate shows a balance of juicy peach and pineapple, with streaks of chalk and a vein of acidity. This is clean, succinct and perfectly enjoyable on its own.
This full-bodied, well-oaked wine offers vanilla, coconut, cinnamon and red cherry aromas that meet tart cranberry, strawberry, nutmeg and cream flavors. It's expansive, well balanced, spicy and delicious and will taste best after 2020.
Smoky, slightly nutty aromas dissipate with aeration to reveal fresher notes of apple, lemon and pear here. While closed and tight in profile, fresh acidity and juicy citrus flavors are easygoing and approachable.
Quite sweet on the nose, with cherry-cola, berry jam and other sweet berry fruit flavors. There's not a whole lot of dryness to this red-colored, red-riding Cava. But it's just balanced enough if you're looking for bold berry flavors and a splash of acidity.
One sip of this blend is all it takes to conclude that it's quite a good wine. Dry and balanced, with smooth tannins, it houses blackberry, black cherry, cassis, teryaki beef and sandalwood flavors. Gains extra points for sheer elegance of structure. Now–2013.
Subdued aromas of melon and apple lead to medium-bodied fruit flavors. It comes off as a bit generic, with the variety seeming to get lost.
This warm, ripe wine has spice notes, layers of wood and vivid blackberry fruit. Still young, it will be ready to drink from 2019.
While the alcohol is high and the wine powerful, it has managed to retain its linear, structured character. The result is a concentrated wine that also has acidity and a juicy blackberry fruit character. It does need to age, so don't drink before 2016.
Nicely done for an entry-level wine, with lovely fresh notes of green apple, spring flowers and lime on the nose, followed by apple, pear and pineapple flavors. It's light in body, with a soft finish that maintains its focus without being excessively tart. Imported by Billington Imports.
There's plenty of size, sweetness and fruit on the nose. It feels rich and ripe, with an exemplary weight-to-acid ratio, and it tastes juicy, fruity and friendly, with notes of black licorice and dark chocolate on the finish. A wine that properly blends Malbec's sweet and sultry sides.
Not bad, but given that it's a reserve-level bottling from a great vintage, you'd expect more. The nose displays interference in the form of barnyard, rubber and mild volatile acidity. It's only medium in terms of intensity and density, while the flavors rest on basic red fruit touched up by lactic vanilla and tomato. Not enough substance, clarity and oomph for a $36 wine.
The mysteriously named Inchinnan offers a flavorful mix of mint, berry, cherry, milk chocolate, Asian spice, cedar and cola. It's harmonious, with subtle power and excellent length.
The initial impression is of black fruits, chocolate and coffee flavors. These delicious tastes are supported by structure, intense tannins and juicy acidity. Age this elegant Blaufränkisch for another two years.
This very affordable wine from the Gregory Ahn portfolio begins with clean notes of blackberry juice, black iced tea and graphite. It's spicy, bright and juicy once sipped, proving very refreshing, and a great example of the stripped-down wine everyone talks about making.
A bit hot in high alcohol, with a chili pepper bite behind the enormously ripe raspberry and cherry jam, chocolate, beef jerky and pepper spice flavors. Drink now.
The aromas offer notes of cherry, baking and barrel spices and are topped off with partially amped-up volatiles. The flavors are lush and full bodied, lingering on the finish.
Here's a wine that advertises the Casablanca formula: pink grapefruit and orange on the nose, followed by lemon fruit with a fair amount of bitter zest. Being so citrusy, the finish is lasting albeit monotone. Fails to offer any richness.
Relatively plump and succulent for a “Dry Riesling”, with honeyed, musky notes that accent ripe peach and dusty mineral flavors. Not quite dry on the finish, but powered by crisp acidity.
Creamy and toasty in the mouth, with nice acidity to give it structure. A consistent sparkler with enough versatility to be consumed with a meal; not just for toasting. Imported by Prestige Wine Imports Corp.
This super Tuscan blend of Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot is showing so beautifully now. It opens with rich, lovely intensity and bright aromas of black fruit, cassis, spice, leather, mocha and tobacco. Drink it now or let it age 10 years or more.
Spicy, austere wine with serious tannins. It is very structured, the dense texture showing dry tannins and dark fruit. Dark, serious and severe.
A blend of two different vineyards, this ripe wine is now very mature. It has lost its primary fruitiness and developed toasty spice as well as a more funky, earthy character.
I far prefer this to the 30th Anniversary bottling. Complete, wholesome, healthy, very delicious. Smoky, ashy nose, cherry vanilla, char. Sweet cherry-mocha flavors, soft, velvety mouthfeel. Combines power with delicacy. Very fine. Now-2012 and beyond.
Begins with leather, earth and stewed plum aromas. The body is big and manly, with smooth tannins and a chunky mouthfeel. Flavors of plum, berry and rhubarb are lively, accented by a touch of milk chocolate.
We have not been impressed with this Cab in recent years. This vintage is mulchy, raisiny and baked, with prune-like core flavors and a medicinal, cooked finish. Hard, tannic and not that well balanced.
Mild citrus and grassy aromas are quiet, while this feels pithy and flat for a young wine. Tangerine and persimmon flavors are not on the money for Sauvignon Blanc, with a mildly bitter and pyrazinic finish.
Here's a modern and beautiful wine with warming tones of vanilla, spice, chocolate and blackberry. The wine is thick and dense with dark extraction and very solid tannins. Drink after 2010. A Marc de Grazia selection, various American importers.
Here's a nice cocktail-style wine that pleases for its dryness and crispness. It's basically a simple quaffer, with no oak at all, and rewards for fresh, ripe pineapple, Meyer lemon, fig and date flavors. Try with your best homemade Ahi tuna tartare.
A picture-perfect mix of fruit, acid, stone and tannin. The fruit is sweet and ripe, the acid provides a natural underpinning, the tannins are polished and there are hints of minerality, along with tobacco, licorice and chocolate. Nicely done; this is a new winery to watch.
This wine is an unusual blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (40%) with the rest Sangiovese, Syrah, Merlot and Mourvèdre. Aromas of fresh raspberries, cranberries and toast lead to fleshy red and black-fruit flavors that skirt the edges.
Simple and fruity, this Syrah has ripe cherry and chocolate flavors and a layer of caramelized oak. The finish is sugary.
Avoids the variety's opulent, often sweet side in favor of a leaner, drier, more elegant style. It has the weight and texture of a Sauvignon Blanc, yet offers rich but subtle tropical fruit, white flower and mineral flavors, with a smack of sweet oak. This is a complex wine, and you don't want to drink it too cold.
The opening aromas of reedy berries are gritty and crusty, while the palate is lively but feels snappy and raw. Flavors of cherry and plum are light, while the finish is straightforward, with a citrusy kick. Not as full and generous as past vintages.
This wine is so dry, sharp, and tart, it's like lemon juice. Some will like it, while others more used to ripe, sweet fruit may find it sour. One thing is for sure, it could use some food. One of those wines that's great with shellfish.
Leafy berry aromas suggest black pepper and asphalt. This has a rough mouthfeel with green tannins. Flavors of sawdust and hickory smoke sit on top of rubbery berry fruit notes, while the finish is buried in oak.
Quite closed up, this wine has weight and intensity that will give concentration to the potentially ripe flavors of apricots, mandarin oranges and a twist of lemon zest. All of these flavors are integrated with the developing honeyed richness.
This is smooth, round and Zinfandel-like in its fulsome toasty character and abundant chocolate and black fruit flavors. As it's aged in 100% new French oak for 17 months, the oak looms large and lasts a long time.
Nice and dry, with plenty of upfront blackberry, cherry and currant flavors. The tannins are thick and furry, and the acidity is sharp through the finish. It's a rustic wine that needs big, rich fare with which to do battle.
Earthy aromas of truffle, leather, tar, crushed plum and a hint of mocha lead the nose. The vibrant palate delivers black cherry, raspberry, graphite, tobacco and a licorice note alongside firm, polished tannins. Enjoy through 2018.
A brisk Pinot Noir—it's rich in citrusy acidity that gets the mouth watering. The flavors are fresh and young, suggesting raspberry and cherry jam, with a strong note of smoky oak. All indications are that this wine is too young now and will age for 5–6 years, mellowing but not necessarily gaining complexity.
Even though this Pinot Noir is instantly likeable for satisfying richness, it has some nuances. Flatters right off the bat with a soft texture housing lush raspberry and cherry pie filling, cola and sandalwood flavors that are easy to appreciate. But there are interesting mineral complexities. Drink soon.
With bright red fruits and acidity, this shows structure, piles of red cherry flavors, followed by firm tannins.
Named after a Roman centurion rather than a god of love, Saint-Amour produces structured Beaujolais. With its solid tannins and firm structure, this wine proves the point. It is concentrated, with acids and minerally red fruits dominating at the moment. It needs to age for 1–2 years.
Here is a fresh and youthful expression of Friulano with pretty aromas of yellow rose, almond blossom and peach. The main characteristic of this variety is excellent texture in the mouth and this wine lives up to that promise.
Steely in wet stone and high-toned citrus, this Chardonnay is from Hyde-Old Wente clones and deftly made in a light style that doesn't skimp on delicious complexity. Apple and herb figure prominently, as does a remarkable mouthfeel of minerality, a testament to the winery's cool growing sites.
Fruity and immediately accessible, this is a crisp and delicious wine. It is lively with citrus acidity and bright with a tangy texture. The wine finishes with a salty, mineral aftertaste. Drink now.

Aged in a combination of oak and stainless steel, this brooding, dark selection delivers strawberry, red apple, dark chocolate and crème de cassis aromas. It's thick and sweet, but it shows nicely balanced acidity.
Sweet oak tones come to the forefront of this bright Barbera d'Alba and add tones of vanilla, chocolate and cinnamon spice. There is enough fruit here, however, to balance out the wood tones and the wine is smooth and rich in the mouth.
Mature, oily aromas of melon and sweet potato lack vivacity. This blend of Albariño, Caiño Blanco and Loureiro feels mature, with lightly oxidized stone-fruit flavors. A plump, dry-tasting finish indicates that it should be drunk right away.
A very agreeable, satisfying blend of ripe fruit and firm texture makes this full-bodied wine a winner. It has enough concentration to drench the palate with blackberries and linger on the finish with cinnamon accents.
Rather lean, but with attractive red currant edginess, this is definitely a lightweight wine to be served chilled.
Beautiful and elegant, this has golden highlights, offering intense aromas of honey, toasted almond, pine nut and candied fruit. The finish is sweet and long, with a touch of crispness.
This is a Merlot-dominant blend, with additions of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Sangiovese. At first tight, spicy and herbal, it then blossoms with dark, deep juicy black fruits. The finish is long and trim, bringing in more complexity, with coffee, cassis and espresso. Drink now through 2025.
The aromas are bright, with notes of whole cantaloupe, candle wax and ripe sliced banana. The palate is bone dry, with tart, lemony acids providing the structure. Bitters linger on the finish.
The rosy floral overtones of Muscat are very evident on the fragrant nose. The palate, on the other hand, gives us the texture of Pinot Gris and the freshness of Riesling while floral nuances hover and swirl. This is a lovely blend of all that Alsace does well. Friendly and fresh with a dry finish.
This is a lovely, funky and earthy blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Sangiovese. Light bodied in style, it imparts touches of mushroom, bouillon and leather around its core of black fruit, remaining savory in personality throughout.
This is a big, dark and concentrated wine with exotic spicy, oaky aromas, rich and ripe fruit flavors, an absolutely creamy, mouthfilling texture and lingering finish. Deft touches of graphite and cedar in the aromas meet generous black plum, mint and cherry on the palate.
Aromas of mint, dark-skinned berry and roasted coffee beans lead the nose. The concentrated palate delivers baked plum, mocha, blackberry, chopped herbs and a confectionary note alongside fine-grained tannins.
This is actually Wahluke Slope fruit, though labeled simply Columbia Valley. Tart pomegranate fruit, a seam of clay and well-integrated highlights of herb and earth mark this extremely limited-production wine as special. Dolcetto does not have much of a track record in Washington, but what's here is quite promising.
This bright Chianti Classico offers cherry, forest berry and blue flower notes, backed by touches of wet earth and leather. The palate is smooth and firm, and it has a fresh, almost herbal finish.
A silky, medium-bodied selection, this features elegant notes of cherries, fine leather and baking spices. It's a soft, easy-to-drink wine for immediate consumption.
The nose on this Albariño deals tropical fruit and vanilla scents. It feels citrusy, with modest flavors of papaya, peach and white melon. After showing moderate vitality on the palate, the finish softens up and slips into the netherworld. Seems as though it's beginning to fade.
Offers very soft fruit, open and rounded. There is some acidity, some flavor of melon and pears complemented with toast and an edge of citrus. The finish is lightly mineral.
While it's not complex this is certainly well composed. It opens with subtle aromas of yellow flower and orchard fruit while the light, easygoing palate offers pear and citrus. Crisp acidity gives it a clean, refreshing finish.
Black plum and black currant are jammy on the brambly nose. The smooth tannins take a backseat to the jammy and plummy black fruits on the medium-bodied palate. There is just enough acidity to keep this wine from turning flabby. Black plum, a touch of baking spice and warmth linger on the finish.
A bitter, caramel-flavored wine, this is tight and peppery. A lean character leaves a sharp aftertaste.
Full honey- and melon-flavored wine, with a soft-textured character. It is full of ripe red apples, well made, if internationally anonymous.
Crisp red plums and sour cherries add a tart fruit character to this sheer Finger Lakes Pinot Noir. Brisk on the palate with a good dose of bramble in the midpalate, it finishes clean on a minty, herbaceous note.
Here's a classically rich, barrel-aged Chardonnay. With a beautiful golden color, it brims with pineapple, golden mango and lemon custard flavors, enhanced with bright, citrusy acidity. Very fine and classy, at a great price.
Rather full and deep in the nose. Some black fruit come across as being chunky but fresh. It’s quite the mouthful, with lots of oak in the backdrop providing a big serving of vanilla. Long, dry and oaky at the end. Interesting, though not overly complex or layered.
This bottling from a region known for savory, earthy wines fits the bill, with strong gravel, black pepper, elderberry and wet pine aromas. It's dry and dense on the palate, with forest spice, menthol and black fruit touches. Characteristic of the region and still very firm and tight in structure.
With candied, sweet and sour cherry flavors, this Syrah is pretty rustic. It's very soft, but okay for a big party.
Funky but not unpleasant aromas of game, scorched earth and cured meat are joined by whiffs of wild berry and leather. The palate shows dried cherry, aniseed, and grilled sage alongside firm, fine-grained tannins. Drink sooner rather than later to enjoy the remaining fruit.
Just wonderful, showing the great richness and complexity of a top Santa Rita Pinot Noir. Partial whole-cluster fermentation gives the wine a spicy earthiness and full-bodied tannins, yet the underlying red berry and cherry fruit shines through. Showing well now and over the next six years.
Honey, white flower, peach and lemon blossom are some of the pretty aromas on offer. Light and delicate, it also feels creamy, rich and sweet on the finish.
Starts off with scents of apples and citrus, and maintains that fruit-forward focus all the way through. It's medium-bodied, with a slightly creamy midpalate and a touch of lemon custard on the finish.
Roasted berry, dry oak, bacon, leather, graphite and spice aromas come together on the nose. It feels jammy, thick and chewy, with full tannins setting up flavors of baked berry and molasses. It finishes similarly, with a rich, full texture and a candied flavor. This is a blend of 80% Cabernet Franc and 10% each Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot.
I often find Leal's red wines to be too sweet and rustic in mouthfeel, and so it is with this Rhône blend. It has a roughly tannic texture and a sugary cherry finish.
As the production on this wine climbs (it's up to 35,000 cases now), the final product becomes more generic. An opening of bold berry fruit comes with a pounding mix of oaky vanilla and milk chocolate, while the palate has acidity for zest but also a lot of creamy oak. Very oaky on the finish, leaving a lasting impression that's more about resin and vanilla than fruit or individuality.
Briny, minerally, dusty aromas of white currant and crushed vitamins set up a foamy, lazy palate. Salty flavors of apple and persimmon finish flat, with a briny aftertaste.
Very dry and tannic, this has interesting suggestions of cherry, rose petal, red currant and mineral, all kissed by oak. It's light in body, like a Pinot Noir, but with some real complexity. Drink now.
The ripeness and heat are immediately noticeable in the liquorous nose. Supple and smooth in the mouth, it shows a blend of pretty purple fruits and polished tannins, layered with barrel flavors emphasizing espresso and strong toast. Classic Michel Rolland, inviting and generous.
Sometimes an annata Brunello can score higher than the riserva expression from the same vintage. With that extra year of aging, the ripe fruit on the already very plump and fruity 2007 vintage has dropped a tiny notch in intensity. But the elegance, balance and complexity of the wine remains the same.
This is a wild-yeast, barrel-fermented wine that makes one wonder why other producers' versions are so pricey. Silky textured and moderately weighty on the palate, it offers up complex aromas of smoky struck flint, subtle herbaceousnes and ripe melon and fig. Drink it now–2017.
Dark in color, dry and tannic, this 100% Syrah is rich in blackberry, dark chocolate, roasted meat and black pepper flavors. They combine with new oak to produce a wine of real complexity. This is one of the more interesting Syrahs to emerge from the Paso area.
This classic Brunello is slightly more closed aromatically and subdued at first, but opens to deep layers of berry fruit and exotic spice as the wine stays in the glass. Elegant flavors of almond and cassis appear as pretty accents on the long fade.
This new Artist Series red is three-quarters Cabernet Sauvignon, 18% Merlot, and the rest a mix of Cab Franc and Malbec, mostly from the Cold Creek Vineyard. Blue and black fruits are enhanced with barrel flavors of smoke, tobacco and espresso. Some additional years in bottle should help this wine knit together seamlessly.
Earthy berry and licorice aromas are composed, lightly oaked and attractive. This standard Priorato blend of Grenache, Carignan and Syrah is fresh feeling, with a bolt of bracing acidity. Juicy plum and raspberry flavors finish loamy, earthy and balanced. For a wine that's no heavyweight, this is strong throughout. Drink through 2018.
This wine starts off with an assertive aroma of brambly berry, followed shortly after by touches of warm compote and sweet spice. The tannins are structured but fine, lending support to the otherwise round palate brimming with fleshy dark-cherry and black-plum flavors. 100 cases imported; enjoy now–2017.
With its lively mousse, this wine is initially all about fruit. Gradually, the richness and well-balanced texture show themselves, giving a structured wine where the fruit is a delicious contrast to the hints of toast and tight acidity. Drink the wine now.
Though it hits the right notes of blueberry and plum, this Malbec is otherwise nondescript, hailing from the Red Hills Lake County subregion of the larger Lake County, where Cabernet Sauvignon has done particularly well.
A reduced character of diesel and strong oak mark the entry of this vineyard-designated wine. It's ripe and powerful, veering on sweet.
This grassy, very herbaceous wine is all crisp green fruits. Touched by a creamy texture under a layer of freshness, it shows some good weight and structure. There is light wood that rounds it all out.
Dry, tannic and impressive for its depth of fruit, showing blackberry, chocolate and currant flavors that veer into overripe raisins, which gives some bitterness to the finish. The mouthfeel is a little hot in alcohol, but creamy smooth. Hard to say where this wine is going, so drink over the next four years.
This smells like toasted bread and hickory smoke and tastes even more charred and smoky. Like a good barbecue sauce it has a sweet touch to balance the smoky, jammy fruit flavors. This is an extreme taste experience that will be a big hit with some.
Spicy red berries, cedar, vanilla and clove on the nose are followed by delicious, savory layers of smoke, spice and cherry and black currant fruit in this go-to Cabernet. Mouthfilling with a spicy backbone and fine-grained tannins, finishing with a smoky, savory edge. A distinctive red with heft.
A perfect mixing agent for Campari or peach cocktails, this bright Prosecco delivers stone fruit, lime and honey. Or, drink it on its own with spicy chicken wings.
The nose on this Syrah is ripe, with plum and raisiny aromas. It's lively in the mouth, albeit raw feeling, with red berry, plum and currant flavors. A short, mildly oaky finish closes the show.
This is a crisp, Syrah-based rosé, with some passion fruit on the nose, but then ripe berry flavors on the palate. It's plump and medium-bodied, yet finishes with a zing of refreshing acidity. Drink now.
Made with late-ripened grapes (85% Vermentino and 15% Viognier), this has aromas suggesting beeswax, pressed yellow flower and a whiff of honey. The aromas carry over to the round palate along with suggestions of apricot and nectarine.
This vibrant wine opens with aromas of red berry, cake spice and a hint of toast. The bright palate offers sour cherry, raspberry, white pepper and aromatic herb alongside assertive but refined tannins that need to relax. An aniseed note marks the close.
Jammy aromas of ripe but flat berry fruits and tree bark settle on medicinal and rooty. This feels solid but a touch soupy, with leafy, herbal plum and raspberry flavors. An herbal, saucy tasting finish is easygoing, with drying tannins.
Tart and brambly, this carries well-integrated streaks of earth and bark along with the light berry flavors. At first the tannins feel a bit rough, but the wine smoothes out and lightens up into a fresh, fruity finish.
Light in color, with some cloudiness. On the nose it's fairly lean and herbal, more similar to French Cabernet Franc or Pinot Noir than your typical muscular Priorat. Flavorwise, expect raisin and raspberry notes before a short, spicy finish.
Aged in acacia wood barrels, which give less wood flavor than oak, this is an attractive, lightly oxidized wine with a toasty edge, very dry with almond and honeyed fruit flavors.
This rusty colored rosado is flat and neutral on the nose. In the mouth, it's full but also flabby, while slightly bitter stone-fruit and melon flavors finish long but with a lashing of bitterness and burn.
This inky-dark red wine made from the hearty Aglianico grape shows chewy, rich berry flavors and determined alcoholic heat. This is a powerful red wine, with loads of black fruit intensity and a bold, chewy finish.
Grapefruit scents and flavors dominate this tasty wine. Some will find it identifies more closely with something akin to New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc, rather than a seasalty Albariño from Spain. No matter: It's fresh and zippy and best enjoyed within a couple years of the vintage.
While the nose reveals only faint whiffs of apples, nuts and brambles, the palate of this off-dry Riesling is crisply concentrated with fresh red apples and tart peaches. It's not a deeply persistent wine, but finishes brisk and bright.
This wine just steps over the line to get its' varietal label with the rest Petit Verdot, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Tempranillo. It has notes of chocolate, pencil lead and dried herbs with plump, ripe tannins. An enjoyable easy drinker.
This is smooth and accessible, putting a light chocolate frame around rhubarb and strawberry fruit. There's a hint of pepper, and the wine is fresh and youthful, good sipping wine for late summer/early fall.
A delicious Pinot Noir to drink now with upscale fare. It's very fruity, offering a burst of raspberries and cherries, together with a coat of sweet, smoky oak. But crisp acidity and smooth, silky tannins provide a balanced structure.
This young wine is finding its way, tight and grippy still, with a strong sense of oak and tannin. Leathery and savory, with a suggestion of the rustic, it offers a crispness of black cherry and plum on the finish. Drink now after a slight decanting.
Citrus, red plum and currant aromas are wild and gamy. This has an edgy mouthfeel with a rubbery sensation, while citrus and candied red-berry flavors hum along.
Lively fruit aromas are backed by loads of papaya, mango and grapefruit in this stylish expression of Sauvignon from northern Italy. The wine is smooth and compact in the mouth with more texture than expected.
This 100% Sangiovese opens with red-skinned berry and underbrush aromas. The easygoing palate evokes raspberry jam with a touch of cinnamon, framed by round tannins. Enjoy soon.
Smooth and soft in the mouth, this has rich cherry flavors and a generous amount of caramel and chocolate from barrel aging. It's a palate-pleasing wine, straightforward and probably at its drinking peak.
Here's a Bordeaux-style blend to snap up if you're lucky enough to find it. It's a definite re-issue in that it was first released at $25 in 2006 but was put back on the market last year at $15. And what a bargain it is: Earth, tar and tobacco vie with dried cherry and raspberry on the nose and palate; the finish is long, elegant and dry. A mature, classy wine to drink now.
The rock soils of the Kollmütz vineyard give a very lean, mineral, almost austere character to this wine, in its early development. This is going to broaden out—there are already the green plum, intense flavors and a bright, crisp acidity. Screwcap.
Here's a light-bodied casual wine that has subdued aromas suggesting white flower, orchard fruit and a hint of almond. You can find traces of the nose on the extremely simple diluted palate.
Rich, soft, ripe and juicy, this Cab shows all the hallmarks of the modern cult style. It's incredibly lavish in oak, blackberry pie, cassis liqueur and licorice flavors, and should drink well for the next six years.
This celebration of Tannat is a balanced while severe and structured wine. Plenty of juicy fruit is ready to come out from behind the dry, tannic structure. There is power here as well in this wine that is firm and needs to age. Drink from 2019.
Smooth wood and spice flavors give this wine immediate attractiveness. It has weight and richness, ripe fruit flavors and a spacious feel to the texture. With its complex structure, it's a wine for aging, so drink after 2016.
Shows the fine varietal characteristics of dryness, silkiness and fruitiness you want in a nice Russian River Pinot, with suggestions of cherries, currants, root beer and smoky oak. There's also a streak of wintergreen tartness that seems to limit the cellar-worthiness. Best now and through 2010.
90–92. Barrel sample. This is an herbaceous, cool wine that shows fresh pear and lime flavor. It does have a sense of structure that gives density and texture on the finish.
True to its legacy, K-J's V.R. Chard is almost off-dry and soft in style, with pleasant mango, peach, orange and vanilla flavors. It's an easy-drinking wine to enjoy with everyday picnic or beach fare.
This is a soft rounded wine. With a generous texture and warm white stone-fruit flavors, it is smooth with only a mild tang of clementine peel. The wine is delicious, ripe and ready to drink.
At first, this smells unexpectedly of almonds. But overall, this is a viscous bottle of raisin, blackberry and tar flavors.

Pear and honey scents presage luscious flavors of ripe pears, melon and dried spices. It's medium-bodied and dry with a long finish that shows a touch of alcoholic warmth, so opt for drinking it over the next few years.
A little sharp and angular, with a touch of cat pee on the nose. But with air and time this bubbly rises above the masses. Flavors of lime, orange and apple are cleansing and fresh, while the feel is comfortable and a touch foamy. Lasting on the finish, with some class that hints at Champagne.
Salomon makes wines from the vineyards they have rented from the Metternich family on the Pfaffenberg. This is a beautiful floral wine, flinty and crisp. It also shows supple acidity, fruit flavors and a long, intense aftertaste. Expect this to age well.
From the Alban “Powerblock” clone, this estate bottling shows elegant if still somewhat restrained aromas of black currant and violet on the nose. The palate is extremely well integrated and seamless, with dense black fruits lifted by kicks of purple flowers. Quite beautiful but nothing too flashy in any one direction.
Big and bold, with powerful aromas of apple, lemon curd, melon and toast. Features the ripest fruit going, and that results in tropical-influenced flavors of pineapple and pink grapefruit. Playing second fiddle is a cinnamon-spice undercurrent with a hint of banana. Imported by Beaune Imports.
This is Zinfandel on steroids, which is the Wilson house style. The wine is dry, full bodied and very high in alcohol, approaching 16%. Yet it's zesty and exuberant, with a wealth of blackberry, currant and pepper flavors. Distinctly Californian and Dry Creek Valley, it's a fine example of its type.
Pure Touriga Nacional gives a perfumed, ripe and richly juicy wine. Tannic structure offers a base for the acidity and black currant fruit, but it's soft enough to drink now.
With its fresh prickle on the tongue and off-dry character, this is an easy, lemon-candy flavored wine that is best drunk young and well chilled. The finish is fresh and crisp.
Melon and citrus aromas and flavors mingle easily in this cleanly made quaffer. It's a bit plump on the palate, yet refreshing on the lemon-lime finish.
The top rosé from Minuty is 95% Grenache, and shows a richly spiced nose that's almost musky or feral, balanced by pink grapefruit aromas. It's longer and finer in the mouth than the Cuvée de l'Oratoire, with more pronounced minerality and crisper acids.
Tastes a bit tired, with apricot and pineapple flavors that are losing their fruity flesh, showing herbal bones. Dry and crisp, it's unlikely to improve with further age.
They took only the best fruit they could find for this expensive wine, and made only 1,280 cases of it. Using every Burgundian trick in the book, winemaker Steve Test has created a rich, creamy wine, long on smoky oak and yeasty lees, with impressive spice and fruit that veers toward peaches and more tropical notes.
Spiced plum, blue flower, vanilla, French oak and balsamic aromas lead the way on this firmly structured red. Full-bodied and elegant, the youthful, enveloping palate evokes blackberry, black cherry, pipe tobacco and ground clove framed in tightly knit fine-grained tannins. Drink 2020–2032.
Everything about this white smacks of elegance: the slatey, citrus nose, the clean, refreshing slate, asparagus and lime flavors, the flinty, lemon-lime finish. Reserved and poised, it's fresh with a light, minerally touch. Pair with ceviche, oysters or sip on a hot summer day.
Sizable oak presents itself in this wine, before more delicate nuances of cedar, pencil shavings and firm, integrated tannin make themselves known. Full bodied and robustly built, this wine also has balance, offering a cooler-climate sensibility to the fruit and savory touches. Enjoy best 2024–2030.
Simple aromas may lack vibrancy but aren't offputting. And frankly speaking, it's nice to smell soft berry fruit and not much else (namely burnt or buttery oak). The palate, meanwhile, is plump, bright and full of clean but basic boysenberry fruit. Finishes thin but sturdy.
Some earthy elements mingle with the fruit, which has a ripe tomato edge. Good structure, without the harshness or heat that affects so many '97s. If anything, it's a little underripe, with bell pepper, beet and earthy flavors.
Cocoa powder is met by overfilling notions of wild blackberry and black cherry in this memorably textured and complex wine from the mountain. A smoothness on the midpalate roughs out the rockiness of the back tannins and fistfuls of supportive oak, finishing in a high-toned minerality that echoes volcanic soils and gravel.
This is dark, with a dominant wood flavor that covers the potentially ripe fruit. It is full of firm tannins, with a flavor of bitter chocolate. It may be that this wine will always have too much dry wood.
Some toasted notes of smoke and campfire emerge at the tail end of forest berries and blackberries. The wine is tonic and tight in the mouth with crisp acidity and a pleasantly easy feel overall. Nebbiolo grapes are called Spanna in the Colline Novaresi appellation.
Reminiscent of some Paso Robles red wines, this superripe Shiraz has some sweetly grassy or alfalfa-like aromas to go alongside blackberry and chocolate flavors that lean toward coffee and caramel on the finish. It's round in the mouth, the tannins ultrasoft; drink now. Imported by Pernod Ricard USA.
This pure Merlot wine suffers from excessive wood aging giving an extra-dry character. To compensate, the red fruit is perfumed and rich. Another year will help the softening process although probably not enough.
Very distinctive and unique in terms of its aromatic delivery, this beautiful Barbaresco boasts complex layers of licorice, root beer and white cherry that help support a lively vertical lift. A light ruby appearance is followed by tight astringency and crushed black pepper. Pajoré plays the elegance card very well.
Nutty, with a note of baked lemon, this affordable, approachable wine is robust in tropical ripeness yet retains enough acidity to remain fresh and fruity throughout.
This seems a bit oaky on the nose, where scents of baking spices and cedar dominate, but those elements are balanced out on the palate, where blackberries, plums and black currants comes to the fore. This is a full-bodied, ripe-textured wine worth a look. Drink now–2025.
Smells like old peaches and tastes a bit like tangy tangerine and grapefruit. It's pithy, lumbering and fails to show any purpose, clarity or crispness. Too strange to recommend, but not undrinkable.
This is a very likeable and approachable Prosecco with bright aromas of white flower, citrus and peach. The wine is tonic, crisp and balanced and because this is a Brut expression, the wine is dry and fresh.
Very laid back, the nose shows some mango and pear, but you really have to go looking for them. In contrast, the palate is almost pushy–this is a big, fat intense wine. Essentially quite simple, but very tasty. Short to medium finish.
Opaque and thick, this soft, black peppery wine is ripe and bright in clove, crisp red currant and cranberry, with a streak of eucalyptus-like mint. It finishes in a subtle flourish of cedar and tar.
From a producer in the same family since 1834, this rosé is crisp and poised. Attractive red fruits are sharpened by orange zest and filled out with an edge of tannin from the addition of red wine to give color. The wine is young, fruity and ready to drink.
Fleshy, unfocused aromas of apple and peach are a touch oxidized. This Chardonnay feels bland. Flavors of melon and peach lack tension and character, while there's not much flavor to the finish other than mild apple and some bitterness.
Blackberry and blueberry flavors are ripe on this easy drinking, off-dry wine. It's juicy and rich, but lifted by a spray of crisp red cherry on the finish.
This simple fruity wine is perfumed and attractively fragrant. With a blend that includes the unusual Perrum grape (also known as Pedro Ximenez in the Sherry region of Spain), it is smooth, refreshingly creamy and ready to drink.
The wine is soft, ripe and fruity with fine tannins and plenty of red-berry fruit flavors. Structured and spicy, it will develop well into a concentrated ripe wine. Jean-Michel Baudet's Blaye estate vineyards were the first to be certified sustainable by Terra Vitis. Drink from 2018.
There's a slightly gamy, pleasantly rustic touch to the nose of this hearty bottling, with a broad and deep boysenberry base spiced up by dark cola, nutmeg and wet gravel aromas. The mouthfeel is very full and the tannic structure is tight, propping up flavors of dark mulberry, tree bark and more roasted game.
As big as you expect a Howell Mountain Zin to be, offering rich, deep blackberry, currant, chocolate, licorice, bacon and cedar flavors that are sweet and dry at the same time. It's not just powerful in flavor, it's wonderful in structure, with refined tannins and balancing acidity. A minor criticism is some heat from alcohol, but that's the nature of ripe Zinfandel.
Finely structured, with rich tannins and pleasantly complex flavors of black currants, mocha, pepper spice and smoky oak. Loses a few points for its excessive, jammy sweetness.
From an 850-foot-elevation site four miles from the ocean, this offers a depth of dark cherry and Asian spice, lightly bodied and textured. It delivers a hit of bittersweet chocolate on the tangy finish, with an intriguing streak of charcuterie that's hard to shake.
Boldly fruity, redolent with cherries and pink grapefruit, this medium-bodied rosé does have a slightly candied quality to it, but remains a decent summertime quaff. Serve well chilled to help mute the apparent sweetness.
Raw, scratchy cherry and plum aromas are dusty and lightly herbaceous. A full, blocky, chewy palate deals roasted plum and currant flavors. On the finish, this wine tastes smoky, with a note of grilled meat.
Earthy berry, olive and latex aromas are sleepy and chunky. In the mouth, however, this is more grating and alive. Flavors of earthy, salty plum and raspberry finish similarly, with bold acidity, liveliness and a salty after­taste.
Corvino (a 100% expression of the native Corvina grape from the Verona area) shows light touches of spice and raw berry fruit that form an informal but inviting whole. The wine is compact, clean and fresh on the finish.
Although this wine sees contact with stainless steel only (no oak), there is a carbonized, toasted quality to the fruit regardless. The mouthfeel is characterized by ripe cherry, dried lavender and spicy church incense.
Lovely, fresh, clean, with pure apricot, honey, sweet-sour pineapple, caramel, smoke, vanilla aromas. Fresh and creamy, fruity, oaky. Notable for bright acidity. Finishes complex and spicy.
A powerful, intense wine. The fruit is green and crisp, but the wine is full-bodied, with flavors of toast and almonds over ripe grapefruit and gooseberries. This wine is still very young, only just beginning to integrate the fruit and the acidity—give it 10 years.
Each Jacob's Creek Reserve wine is now sourced from a specific region, and this Chardonnay shows solid improvement as a result. It's medium in body, with notes of grilled pineapple and sweet corn and a brisk, citrusy finish. Drink it over the next 6–9 months.
Prüm's 2007 Sonnenuhr auslese shows a typical youthful yeasty-leesy-sulfur funk, but also layers of ripe pear and citrus fruit lurking underneath. It's sweet but wonderfully balanced, plump and creamy in texture and long on the finish.
A pretty ensemble of floral tones, ripe fruit and toasted almond leads into drying touches of granite and mineral, with some root beer-like notes. Some raw berry aromas need time to soften. Shows a silky, polished feel, then turns compact, crisp, firm and clean on the close.
The name refers to the Seven Hills vineyard grapes, which deliver exceptional minerality to this sleek, elegant Syrah. Mixed light red fruits show pomegranate, wild berry and cherry, with refined texture and deceptive intensity.
This is the first release from this particular vineyard for the Syrah-focused winery. Its aromas, which pop with notes of strawberry and spice, have both herbal and copper-penny undertones. The fruit and savory flavors play well off of each other, showing a sense of elegance and deftness, with a touch of new wood that contributes to the flavor and feel. The finish stretches out. It still drinks quite young and if the aromas meld together could move up a notch or two.
This wine hails from the terraced heart of the Romaneira vineyard. Dark tannins and a concentrated structure are just the tip of this ripe and complex wine. With its acidity, spice and ripe black fruits, this is a serious, impressive wine that begs to be aged. Drink from 2020.
Big, powerful and rich, beautiful fruit and acidity along with densely structured tannins. This is a powerful expression of great Douro fruit, packed with intensity and concentration, likely to age for many years.
Underbrush, chopped aromatic herb, wild berry and a hint of new leather are the main scent notes. The bright, structured palate is full of layers of juicy red cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon, mint and tobacco set against a backbone of chewy tannins. It's already accessible, and while not loaded with complexity, it is delicious. Drink through 2020.
Made from a single vineyard, this is Franz Weninger's flagship wine. Pure Blaufränkisch, it shows all the exotic flavors of the grape—mineral, spices, black cherries—packaged with dark tannins and smoky, toasty wood. To finish, there is cocoa along with a touch of sweet citrus. Great aging potential.
High alcohol gives this Zin a hot burn, but it's part of the wine's personality. That's along with the chocolate, black currant, cassis and pepper flavors and rich, thick tannins. You'll either love it or not.
Though fairly light, as are many Walla Walla wines, this delicious effort has such pretty strawberry, raspberry and cherry fruit that it seduces rather than overpowers. Just the right touch with oak adds the slightest finish of cocoa powder.
One of a series of releases by this Port producer, this Colheita, or Port from a single harvest, is beautifully poised between red fruits and mature almond and an old gold character. It has intensity, a product of the aging in wood that has just concentrated the wine. Like all Ports of this type, it is ready to drink.
Aromas of red berry and crushed blue flower open this easy-drinking red. The bright, vertical palate offers sour cherry and a hint of cooking spice alongside vibrant acidity and sleek tannins.

Decima Aurea is a refined and elegant expression of Merlot with deep and long aromas of ripe cherry, blackberry pie, Indian spice, clove and old spice. The wine shows the sophistication of age, but also promises years of cellar aging.
This wine's peppery details act as counterpoint to its well-defined raspberry and cherry flavors. Streaks of toast and graphite add to the layers, suggesting further complexity will develop with another year or two in bottle.
Bottled in January 2012, this classic LBV has great perfumed fruit, soft and elegant. A blackberry jam flavor dominates, laced with black cherries and soft tannins. Immediately appealing and drinkable now.
Tall Tales is a new designation for the winery's reserve Syrah. It's unfined, unfiltered and unabashed—a potent, powerful wine which teeters on the edge of bitterness. But within its compact and textural body are lively flavors of boysenberry and coffee grounds, tobacco and vanilla, cola and rock. It pushes deep into the palate and extends into a complex and long-lasting finish.
Earth and mushroom dominate this lighter-style wine, offering aromas and flavors of forest floor and fresh soil, and even a taste of black tea shyly dancing in the background. Well-balanced and complex, it has a silky texture and long, smooth finish.

This wine displays attractive notes of bay leaf and thyme typical of the region, but they overshadow the cherry fruit. Some leathery flavors also show up on the palate. There's a silky mouthfeel, finished off by cocoa-powder-like tannins. Drink now–2025.
Tastes a bit sweet and jammy in sour cherry candy flavors, with high acidity giving it some sting. Doesn't seem likely to improve, so drink now.
A very successful Pinot Noir that shows the splendid characteristics of grapes well grown in the far Sonoma Coast, on famed Goldridge soils. Acidity marks it, crisp and vital and nervy. Yet wrapped into the silky mouthfeel are rich, elaborate cherry, raspberry, Dr. Pepper cola, pomegranate, persimmon and sandalwood flavors that are intricate as a tapestry. A great wine that should develop bottle complexities over the next eight years.
It takes a few minutes to get the best out of this wine. By then the initial cheesiness has worn off, and aromas of mineral, stones and fruit come to the fore. On the palate, the wine shows some good complexity although a short to medium finish.
Made with late-harvest Moscato grapes, this light amber dessert wine boasts evolved aromas of caramel, roasted chestnuts, honey and dried apricot. The wine stays in contact with the skins for three days to achieve thicker, richer structure and deeper texture.
Almost half of this wine's production of 1,800 cases came to the U.S., which should make this broad, mouthfilling white relatively easy to find. The largely neutral palate suggests pineapple, honey and cinnamon, with citrus and spice lingering on the finish. Drink now.
Full, soft wine, mouth-filling with its ripe quince, pear and white currant flavors. It shows some young structure, suggesting ageworthiness, while at the same time giving a delicious aperitif style of lifted freshness. Screwcap.

It's a beautiful expression of the variety with an impeccable mouthfeel and pristine flavors that ride strong until the very end.

This pure Cabernet Sauvignon is not a heavy wine, but within its sleek profile are interesting flavors of berry, leaf and earth. Tannins are crisp and proportionate, and the fruit carries through a graceful, moderately long finish.
Dusty, stony minerality penetrates from start to finish on this dry, full-bodied Riesling. The palate is austere in flavor with bristling notes of lemon pith and dried herbs, but the mouthfeel is rich and round with a luscious mineral-oil viscosity.
A flinty note precedes touches of lemon on the nose. The palate adds a richer dimension of stone fruit to the flavors, a fine fizz accentuating the ripe but bright freshness. Flavors come together beautifully on a fresh, dry and light palate that has convincing creaminess. It's an elegant, if ripe-fruited sparkler.
Stony apple aromas are mostly neutral and lead to a fleshy, semisoft palate with citrus, kiwi and notes of oxidation. Nice and easy but sort of plump and bland. The finish indicates that it's starting to bend and will break sooner rather than later. Drink now.
While the wine is very young, the potential is there. It has rich tannins and berry fruits that are packed with youthful acidity. The structure and the depth of flavor are there with a hint of the juicy fruits as well as the minerality that are both developing. Drink from 2018.
Made entirely from Cabernet Sauvignon, Nemo is hard to analyze. It has typical Cabernet plum and cassis aromas, but also the scent of pickles. The palate is very soft, especially compared to the estate's Chianti. Flavorsof soy sauce, licorice and green pepper make for a confusing palate. It has its virtues, but also some faults. Hence the rating.
This is the inaugural release of this wine, which is composed of fruit from Pepper Bridge and Seven Hills vineyards. It's aromatically generous, with appealing notes of sage, dried herb, cassis, dark chocolate, spice, pencil lead and dark fruit. The palate delivers a mouthful of dark-fruit flavors and tannins that are combined to a fine sheen. It shows a beautiful sense of balance capped off by a persistent finish. It drinks well now but is made with the future in mind.
Full in the mouth, this rich wine comes from vineyards in the hillside valley above Puligny-Montrachet. It has something of the same balance between ripe fruit and a steely texture. The acidity is there, embedded in the toast and ripe pear flavors. Drink from 2017.
This exceedingly light wine was given very subtle amounts of oak. It offers a sophisticated take on sassafras and Bing cherry within an earthy, structured shell that imparts a medium-bodied mouthfeel and plenty of acidity. From a site in Sebastopol, it needs time to open in the glass.
From a selection of old vines, this grand wine is rich and firmly structured. With dark tannins and powerful black plum fruit flavors, it is concentrated and with considerable aging potential. The wine is still young, packed with tannins and will not be ready to drink until 2019.
An ambitious Cabernet that's part of Raymond's program of highlighting individual appellations within Napa Valley. This wine is delicious, exhibiting rich, deep flavors of black currants with tasteful accents of oak. While it's fine to drink now, the tannins and long finish suggest up to eight years in the cellar will be beneficial.
A screwcapped, Rhône-style white, blends 43% Viognier, 39% Roussanne and 18% Marsanne in a tightly wound, fresh, lively wine. Spicy apple and pear fruit flavors run into a medium long finish with some near-term aging potential.
The 2006 Custodian blends slightly disparate pieces into a harmonious whole. Tart berries accent stewed fruit on the nose, while herbal elements highlight superripe fruit and chocolate on the palate. It's full and round in the mouth, ending a bit soft.
Still with intense tannins, this Merlot-dominated blend is young. The fruitiness is all there with ripe smoky fruit and blackberry flavors. It just needs a while for the tannins to soften into ripe generous fruitiness. Drink from 2020.
Soft notes of hay and chalk appear on the nose, nuanced with a hint of lemon. The palate follows with the same flavor-base, majoring on yeast rather than fruit in an elegant, grown-up way. The foam is soft, the finish is dry but utterly refreshing, leaving you with a lasting lemon note.
This is dark, almost black in color at the center, with greening evident at the rim. Syrupy, intense aromas of coffee and dark chocolate make an immediate impact on the nose, followed by syrupy, intense flavors of coffee and molasses. There's mind-boggling concentration here, but just enough acidity to provide a sense of balance. Still, it's hard to imagine drinking more than a couple of ounces of this at a time.
This serviceable, affordable wine is dull on the nose yet highlighted with deep black fruit, toasted oak and graphite on the palate. Its rounded texture adds richness.
A directly appealing wine with notes of peppery spice, stone fruit and citrus zest. It drinks just about dry, with fleshy stone fruit flavors and a good framework of acidity.
An opening act of spices, nutmeg and musk promises much. While offering up some appealing pear and apricot notes the palate doesn't quite deliver as both concentration and persistence are lacking.
This unoaked Chardonnay offers aromas and flavors of apples and almonds and a crisp, fresh structure. Elegant but easy drinking, it will pair well with seafood, poultry and lighter cheeses.
A crowd-pleaser that starts in fifth gear with generous smoky, cedar-like notes, vanilla, cherry, dill and white mushroom. Equally complex and creamy in the mouth with a lush, berry-filled finish. Imported by Vias Imports.
With a blend that is half Cabernet Sauvignon, half Merlot, this is as rich as the year. The weight of fruit is borne by sweet tannins and layers of wood toast. There is a very dense dusty texture along with fine acidity and final blackberry fruit. It is for aging over the next 4–5 years.
Aromatic herb, leather and camphor lead the nose. The firmly structured palate doles out red cherry, strawberry, white pepper and grilled sage alongside tightly wound tannins and bright acidity. An anise note closes the finish.
This is a less ripe, extracted version of Mataro than some others coming out of the Barossa, but because of that it's actually more drinkable. Dark cherry and plum notes form the core of the wine, dressed up by complex hints of mocha, sage blossoms and hickory smoke. It's smooth and streamlined in the mouth, with a long, mouthwatering finish. Drink now–2025.
This fabulous wine comes from a legendary Vintage Port year. Aged in wood and only bottled in 2015, it is so concentrated and intense. The old gold and wood flavors are dominant in a beautiful wine that may be old but certainly has every possible nuance of flavor. It is one in a succession of rare and treasured Ports that occasionally emerge from Port producers cellars. Drink now.
This is a cool vineyard site farmed by Steve Matthiasson. In this small-production offering, anise, lemon and lime rise to the fore of a lengthy, complex texture of tangy acidity and light body. It'll linger in the mind, too.
This makes three knockout vintages in a row from Sol Rouge. The wine has richness, roundness, power and finesse all rolled into a balanced package. It smells gutsy, ripe but also smoky and savory, and tastes deep and layered with cassis, chocolate, and tobacco. A good wrapping of fine tannins pulls everything together.
Thick and viscous in the glass, this densely loaded wine shows buttery, vanilla-laced French toast on the nose as well as black cherry, blackberry, crushed lavender and marjoram notes. The round palate is relatively tight with elderberry, espresso and black-peppercorn flavors, lifted elegantly by purple flowers.
Te Awa's Bordeaux-style red is a blend of 68% Merlot and 16% each Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. Dried herb, plum and mocha notes give an almost St.-Emilion flavor to the wine, but the fruit is definitively New World in style. Supple and creamy enough to drink now, but should also hold a few years.
Full, heavy, chunky wine with a powerful bouquet of black fruit and chocolate. The palate is about as full and concentrated as they come, but there's good balance and aging potential along with cassis, blackberry and mild herbal shadings. Savory and strong as it is long on the finish. Drinkable now but better from 2011–2014.
A Riesling, Pinot Gris, Gewürztraminer, Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and Viognier blend, with aromas that are most reminiscent of Viognier and Gewürz with that mix of crisp citrus and bright, floral fruit. Packed with tasty fruit flavor of melon, apricot and peach, this lingers gracefully through the finish.
Interesting and well structured, this can age a few years or more. Aromas of honey, stone fruit and butterscotch candy give this wine a sophisticated edge.
A slightly smoky, rock-dust component adds a layer of minerality to this wine's spiced pear and melon aromas. On the palate, it's off-dry, zesty and refreshing, with green apple and citrus flavors that end on a tangy note. One of the more lithe examples from the Rheinhessen.

Faintly herbal or green bean notes seem to fade a bit with airing, giving way to cassis fruit and oak-derived elements of vanilla and brown sugar. This is full bodied and richly textured, with a long, velvety finish. Drink now–2020.
Attractive and complex aromas like dried figs and lemon meringue fade to leaner, crisper flavors suggesting green apple and white peach in this light-bodied, well-balanced wine. It's best to drink after 2018 when it will have opened up to more richness.
Savory pepper and raw-beef notes mark on the nose of this tightly wound bottling, as well as nut brittle and teriyaki aromas. Plum skins, lavender and carpaccio show on the sip alongside a wash of flowers and herbs, from lavender to rosemary. The tannins are mouthcoating and need time to develop. Drink 2018–2028.
The Ravazzól vineyards produce fruit with intense aromas of blackberry, chocolate and spice. In the case of this wine, those tones are further enhanced with red apple and mesquite wood. The mouthfeel is smooth and very polished.

It has a raw, nervous quality that will relax with a few more years in the bottle.
Although this wine does not come from a premier-cru vineyard, it hails from a single vineyard that regularly produces delicious white wines. This bottling, rich as befits the year, also has an attractive bright, crisp edge that contrasts with the warm yellow fruits. Drink the wine from 2019.
Powerful, driving Merlot with spice, cherry, herbal olive notes and some meatiness to the bouquet. The palate is racy and forward, with cherry-berry flavors, cola, mocha and oak notes on the finish. A solid, strong-boned wine.
Hot, raspingly dry and pretty tannic to boot, this Grenache, from a high mountain vineyard, also is a little funky and barnyardy. There are some concentrated cherry, currant, Tabasco and pepper-spice flavors, but those strong tannins really get in the way.
This 100% Syrah is tight, young and sappy, and the tart fruit tastes of salmonberries and blueberries, with hints of mineral and flint. Call it a Euro style, with that sort of grip and detail. It rewards airtime and attention, yet still hints at a slightly green edge.
Using fruit sourced from a 20-acre vineyard in Castillon, this is dominated by Merlot, with a touch of perfumed Cabernet Franc. It has an age-worthy structure, showing good balance, firm tannins and ripe fruit.
Oak extract dominates the nose on this wine together with aromas of Golden Delicous apple and lemon zest. The palate offers lemon, oak, vanilla and clove, but it lacks the fruit richness needed to support the oak.
Initially demure notes of pressed apple and pear are amplified on the palate of this deeply fruity Gewürztraminer. Medium sweet in style, it's unctuously citrusy, but marked by exotic hints of tea leaf and potpourri. A lingering, slightly sugary note marks the finish. Drink now through 2020.
Layered aromas of blackberry, cassis, leather and dried cheese are inviting. In the mouth, this Garnacha from vines more than 100-years-old is jammy and friendly. Candied almost syrupy flavors of blackberry and black cherry finish dense and chocolaty, with modest acidity. Drink through 2017.

Drink now through 2015.

Despite a good track record producing California Pinot Noir, Tangley Oaks' foray north into the Willamette Valley does not impress. It tastes and smells of mushroom compost, with no hint of any definitive fruit, no suggestion of varietal character. Two bottles tasted, same results.
Very big, very rich, almost a fruit store in itself.

This Cinsault is a departure for Michael David in that it's hardly oaked, leaner and more subtle in flavor and aroma than many of its other signature wines, a testament to both the 130-year-old Bechthold Vineyard and fine farming.

Notes of poached pear, peach and spice lead to elegant, lightly creamy fruit flavors and a lemony finish. The concentration is light but what's there possesses a good sense of balance.

Sourced from vines planted in 1847, this is a full-bodied, open-knit wine, supple and velvety in texture. Vanilla cream and black cherries mark the nose, while the flavors are more savory, resembling black olives and grilled meat. It's long and lush on the finish. Drink it now through 2025.
Pretty scents of white spring flower and orchard fruit rise from the glass. The off-dry refreshing palate offers sweet white peach and candied citrus peel alongside bright acidity and a soft mousse.

A rich, oaky Chardonnay, fairly standard issue. It's sweet and opulent in vanilla, caramel, buttered toast, pineapple marmalade and ripe pear flavors, in a creamy texture.
Enticing scents of jasmine, wisteria and white stone fruit lead the way. The vibrant palate doles out green apple, juicy pear and white peach accompanied by a soft mousse. A white almond note closes the crisp finish.
Deep and delicious with inviting layers of raspberry and berry cobbler, Big John is a brambly, structured Zin, with bright zaps of black pepper and clove, plus a long, satisfying finish. This is perhaps the best Zin in all of Calaveras County right now.
Tropical, honeyed fruit on the nose. Sweet, but rather dilute fruit. A pleasant, easy wine, with wood flavors. Soft aftertaste.
Toasty aromas are followed by intense black plum fruits twisted with tannins and polished with wood. It's an impressive, powerful wine, with a complex structure. Firm at this stage, it need 4¬–5 years at least to age.
Herb aromas mix with notes of blue and black fruit and sweet barrel spices on the nose, showing smoked meat in the background. The dark fruit flavors are broad in feel and linger on the finish.
Peppery and gingery upfront, delivering the spice that Gewürz is noted for, but in a slightly tame, restrained format backed by pineapple and pear flavors and a soft, off-dry finish. No doubt this is an interesting rendition of NZ Gewürztraminer, but perhaps an earlier release or quicker consumption would serve this wine better?
Sweet and candied, with raspberry and cherry pie, vanilla, dusty chocolate truffle and cinnamon spice flavors. A bit hot, too, with high alcohol that burns in the finish. Drink now.
Muskmelon and lime flavors start off tasting sweet, but are quickly reined in by brisk acidity, finishing chalky and tart. This is a fine Riesling, yet slightly disappointing in the context of previous vintages.
Rich, ripe scents of cherry pie and cherry cola waft from this profoundly aromatic Merlot. It's boldly alcoholic and full bodied, but the palate shows restraint with crisp red berry flavors highlighted by a streak of acidity. Soft, furry tannins coat the finish.
In keeping with a cool year, this '04 has layered acidity, pepper and an intense lemon zest and light, poised flavors. It's vivid, fresh and ready to drink.
Rubbery on the nose, then sharp in the mouth, with herbal, sour plum flavors and weird funk as well. Bitter, tart and hard on the finish.
Mild raisin, black cherry, anise and burnt tire aromas lead to a plump, balanced palate that's full but not overloaded. Earthy baked black-fruit flavors show a hint of oaky coconut, while this Tempranillo finishes with depth and density.
This Zin shows classic Sonoma County character, but it's also a tannic, young wine that wants a little time in the bottle. Tasted at the age of two, it's astringent and jammy, with pepper-infused blackberry and mulberry flavors and a gamy touch of smoked beef. Give it until mid-2009, when it will be fantastic with grilled beef.
Grown only in Croatia, the Zlahtina grape is light, refreshing and redolent of lemon and citrus—akin to a Sauvignon Blanc. This one has a spicy lemon nose and a blend of lemon and orange flavors that stay light on the palate. Friendly and unique, it will pair with seafood.
Imagine sniffing barely ripe peach and guava through their skins to understand the brisk and subtle nose of this wine. The flavors are also subtle, but quite refreshing, with squeezed citrus and poached apple shining brightest.
A wine whose real quality lies in its great fruitiness and open, soft tannins. With just a touch of wood, its stalky black-fruit flavors are all ready to drink. Screwcap.
Malbec with 30% Merlot; Numina starts off with dark mineral and crude oil aromas that give way to floral scents before flavors of cherry, blackberry, chocolate and pepper. There's a lot going on and overall this attempt at a high-end, powerful red blend is successful. It's much better balanced than many of Salentein's “bigger” wines, including Primus.
Loved the 2008 but at this point in time I can't say the same about this bottling. It's vegetal, with heavy bell pepper and asparagus aromas and flavors. Low-volume zest and kick indicates that it has turned; best to wait for the 2010 because this is too green and flat.
From a hot, sandy site in the heart of the Wahluke Slope, this was barrel fermented in neutral oak. The aromas are an inviting mélange of spice, clove, lime and light tropical fruits, and the wine has natural poise and balance. Green apple, lime and peach come into play, along with streaks of butterscotch.
Light and frothy in the glass, this beautifully perfumed dry sparkling is redolent of orange blossoms, apples and pears. A blend of Pinot Noir, Pinot Meunier and Chardonnay, there's a delicious hint of buttery cashew nut and bitter almond amidst the floral, fresh apple and lemon flavors.
Simple fruit and citrus flavors segue to soft layers of creamy mousse and tangerine. This playful Italian sparkler would taste great next to toasted bread with smoked salmon appetizers or grilled shrimp.
Bread crust, citrus, chopped herb and orchard fruit aromas lift out of the glass. The vibrant palate offers lime, nectarine and toasted hazelnut alongside vibrant acidity. An elegant mousse carries through to the crisp, bone-dry finish.
With fruit coming from the Ancient Lakes appellation, this pungent wine has aromas of flowers, tire rubber, berries and herbs. The floral and plum flavors are sweet with a plush feel.
Kicks off with hints of vanilla, honey, melon, peach, spice and citrus flavors. The wine is full bodied and viscous. It finishes with moderate length and a touch of spice at the end. -J.M.
Soft and fruity, with tobacco and smoke aromas, and fresh, vibrant red fruits, topped with fruit tannins and fresh acidity. There's the possibility of aging for 2–3 years.
True to the winery's style, this wine pulls no punches, with aromas of black licorice, dark cherries and woodspice. It's rich and full bodied with a grainy feel.
This wine shows its high alcohol with pepperiness and too much fruit richness. There is certainly power there, followed by superripe plums and dark tannins that are almost enveloped by the fruitiness. Drink from 2015.
Crafted from 50% Chardonnay, 45% Pinot Gris and 5% Pinot Blanc, this straw-colored wine offers aromas of lemongrass and almond blossom. It is balanced in the mouth, with flavors of tropical fruit, pineapple and understated flowers.
Glitzy notes of lychee, pink flower and yellow plum skin mingle on the luscious, pliable palate. A blend of Traminette, Vidal Blanc and Viognier, this is full bodied and a touch sweet, with exaggerated flavors that cling to the finish.
90-92 Barrel sample. Owned by Château Angélus, a soft and gentle wine, wearing its fruit on its sleeve, the tannins light, followed by a juicy texture.
This is a new vineyard from the owners of Bien Nacido, located within sight of the Pacific. The vines are young but promising. This low-production Pinot is dry and racy as the latest clones have given it huge, pure cherry pie, raspberry, cocoa and Fig Newton flavors. Hard to imagine a more delicious young Pinot. Drink this racy wine now.
Profound enough for serious contemplation but with enough broad fruit appeal to serve to a crowd. There's loads of upfront Asian spice and lychee, afloat on a luxurious, sensually textured palate. Notes of geranium and macadamia nuts keep the taste buds entertained and carry over to the lingering finish. The noticeable residual sugar suggests pairing with something slightly sweet, like Tilapia in a mango salsa. Drink now to 2011.
This half Zinfandel and half Barbera from Iscander Borjón, the young owner of Borjón Winery, is a stunning introduction to his wines. Soft, spicy and sexy good, it deftly shows off the one-two punch that is Zin and Barbera in the Sierra Foothills, a mouthful of dusty blackberry and bright, lush cinnamon-cassis.
A soft, rich wine with delicious flavors of pear and red apples, lifted by pineapple acidity. It is ripe, but still young, with touches of yeast and almond. It will age well over the medium-term.
Dark and raisiny, and pushing the ripeness meter to the max. This is a dense, sweet, semihot wine with raisin, stewed berry and jammy black cherry flavors. It's big and broad, more simple than complex, with a raisiny DNA and a boatload of sweetness. Personally, I prefer Cassone's less expensive, more balanced reserva to this wine.
Honeyed richness gives this wine its allure. It's fabulously sweet and unctuous, with apricot-and peach-infused flavors enriched with vanilla and crème brûlée. Could be crisper in defining acidity, but it sure is decadent.
The youngest red in the Couly-Dutheil range is just such pure, exuberant Cabernet Franc. It is perfumed, ripe with black currant fruit and a layered with acidity. Its fruitiness makes it a wine to be drunk young, its tannins giving structure rather than aging potential.
This single variety Ansonica is crisp and fresh and represents the best in Sicily's long tradition in highly drinkable and seafood-friendly whites. This interesting expression puts more emphasis on texture and complexity with notes of crème caramel, honey and vanilla beyond fresh peach, apricot and acacia flower.
Stemmy, stalky aromas cloud over dilute fruit notes, while the palate is on the acidic side, which causes citrus and pithy peach flavors. More pith on the finish, with a hint of banana. Just o.k., with limited character.
This is a Petite Sirah you want to decant to let the air soften it. After a while in the glass,  sweet blackberry, plum, grilled meat, tobacco, pepper and cedar wood flavors emerge. There's a funky edge that adds a wild, feral, mushroomy quality. An interesting wine to drink over the next three years for freshness.
Owned by the Hessel family since the 15th century, this estate has produced a dense and solid Merlot-dominated wine. It is big and bold with ripe berry fruits and dark tannins. The black plum skin and berry flavors are concentrated and firm. It needs to age, so drink from 2018.
This wine is slightly austere at the start, despite its fuller body and style. Leathery and dusty in tannin, the black and blue fruit remain elusive, teasing in between bouts of coffee and chocolate.
Mild comfortable aromas of burnt orange and spiced pumpkin lead to a tight, focused palate of moderate weight. Dry melon and peach aromas are on the money, while this finishes clean as polished glass, with a touch of spice.
Finely balanced, a wine that exudes class and freshness. The green and yellow fruits fill the mouth, round but always with a layer of crispness. Everything comes together, the fruit, the acidity and the rich undertow of spice. Screwcap.
This is too oaky, but it's dry and crisp in acidity, with interesting citrus, tropical fruit and pear flavors. The heavy application of oak results in buttered toast and caramel accents.
Minerally raspberry and cherry aromas come with a touch of latex and rubber. This is lively and scratchy on the palate, with spicy, oaky, peppery flavors of red-berry fruits that lead to a dry, juicy finish.
Thin in flavor but dry and zesty, this blend of five varieties delivers modest orange, peach and vanilla flavors.
Aromas suggest red and blue fruit along with butterscotch and wood spice. The fruit flavors are sweet and rich with abundant woodspice accents and chewy tannins.
Fruity frills of strawberry surround a core of black New Mexican chiles, with cinnamon and clove emerging the longer one sniffs. There's nice tension between the fruit flavors and the nearly bell pepper greenness. Throw a chill on it and serve with barbecued pork.
The lifted, pure scent of damask rose after rain hits you first. It is then joined by riper notions of Mirabelle but always with fresh, airy lift. While the palate weighs this down with perceptible sweetness, the aromas rise unfettered. This is a beautiful wine singing with rose and orange aromatics that persist with a lingering perfume.
Amarone sometimes benefits from a tiny dash of volatility (that usually comes across with aromas that resemble red apple or cider), but in this case those notes have turned to apple sauce and ultimately distract from the overall picture. The wine is chewy and bright in the mouth with firm tannins.
Starts off with scents of slate, pineapple and vanilla, then delivers apple, melon and lime sherbet flavors. It's off-dry, light in body, and easy enough to drink now and over the next six months or so.
Dark plum and berry aromas come with a touch of rubber. It feels bright, healthy and juicy, with good body and earthy berry and dark plum flavors. While it's not complicated, it's accurate and flavorful.
Surprising to find a Cabernet this mature released onto the market. It's a good wine, softly tannic and mellow, whose blackberry and cherry fruit flavors are drying out. Drink up.
This wine is only made in exceptional years from the green grapes in botrytised bunches. There is certainly some sweetness, but the wine is dominated by acidity and apples and cream flavors. The aftertaste, however, is soft.
Dry Creek Vineyard keeps turning out the most drinkable, delicious Cabernets, at such a good price, and hardly anyone notices. Why? Because it's not from Napa. This wine is soft and rich, with briary blackberry, dark chocolate, coffee and spice flavors that finish completely dry. A sophisticated wine.
Gets the job done with a silky texture and crisp acidity. The slightly Porty flavors are of cherries, cola and spices.
Gumball, berry and horsey, rubbery aromas announce a hard, briny style of Tempranillo. Earthy flavors include stalky berry fruits and burnt coffee, while the finish follows with hard, peppery toughness.
Baked black cherry, rare roast beef and light sage aromas show on the dynamic, earthy nose of this bottling by Winemaker Paul Clifton. Garrigue is prominent on the tip of the sip, with strong but not overripe black cherry and plum flavors. These lead into forest floor, juniper, pine needle and mulling spice on the finish.
Made from organically-farmed Nerello Mascalese, this simple wine does show true varietal characteristics of wild fruit, dark mineral and cola. The aromas are mild and the mouthfeel delivers medium intensity.
Smells heavy for a Pinot, with aromas of fresh cement, earth, and—faintly—blackberry. Tannins are light enough, and there's some fruit there, but the overall impression is heavy-handed. Very dry; finishes a bit rough.
A good wine, with honest varietal flavors and easy tannins. Turns dry and rich, with upfront black currant fruit flavors lightly seasoned with oak.
This wine is crisp, tight and mineral while also full of lively apple and citrus fruit. It offers concentration from old vines and a fresh, forward character that demands instant drinking.
The '03 vintage is a particularly good year for D2. The warm, ripe vintage means that this second wine of DeLille  has unusual sweetness and richness across the palate. Toasty and laden with cherry/berry flavors, good weight and concentration, and enough stuffing to hang in there through a long, satisfying finish.
Pungent, feline aromas of sweat and cactus set up a sharp, citric palate that's loaded to the brim with acidity. Austere flavors of passion fruit and lime end with a note of mango along with a wave of citric burn.
Lees aromas are at the fore. The palate is thick in feel, showing a good sense of balance that intrigues.
While the wine is obviously rich, there is a sense of the natural style of Touriga Nacional. The tannins are present, although enveloped by the ripe berry and plum fruits. Touches of dark chocolate go with acidity to finish.
Here's an easy and affordable Ripasso that makes an excellent choice for informal, home-cooked meals. Pasta, risotto or fried pork chops would work well against the wine's fresh acidity, medium build and bright fruit flavors.
A very pretty Sauvignon Blanc that can pair well with a wide variety of foods. Dryish and crisp in acidity, it has brisk, mouthwatering flavors of lemons, limes, pineapples and smoky vanilla.
The vineyard is just east of the Silverado- Trail, below Dalla Valle and just up the street from Screaming Eagle. The wine, which is 100% Cabernet-, shows the intensely concentrated, ripe fruit of this neighborhood, packed with flavors of black-berry preserves, cassis liqueur and a touch of chocolate, wrapped into fine tannins and brightened by acidity. Give it at least eight years in the cellar.
Loureiro has made the region of Ponte de Lima its home, and this full and rich wine brings together the crispness with a more serious perfumed character. It is a wine that could age for a year, although its extreme vibrant fruit is already in great form.
Here's an austere and sophisticated wine from Romagna in Central Italy with deep tones of mature black fruit and spice. It boasts an elegant and stylish air thanks to its velvety texture and generous spice overtones. Pair this wine with meat-stuffed eggplant or succulent lamb chops.
Rustic in the best sense, an honest country wine that's clean and satisfying and meant to gulp now. Shows rich berry and spice flavors and is fully dry. The equivalent of two regular bottles at $7.50 each, it's also one of the most charming bottles in California.
Rather pulpy in texture, but the flavors are fresh and fruity, with bold notes of pineapple, lime and fruit salad. Crisp and clean on the finish.
A bold ripe wine that is full of dark fruits and tannins. It is warm, rounded with spice as well as fine acidity and blackberry flavors. The wine is now fully developed, ready to drink.
A comparatively serious Villages, its tannins firmly in evidence. There is a touch of woodiness as well. Only gradually does the red fruit come through. The aftertaste has fruity and acidity, but still those tannins.
So dry, so clean, so acidic and minerally, just a great version of a Loire-style Sauvignon Blanc. With little or no oak, it shows brilliant lemongrass, peach, vanilla and spice flavors. A wine that cleans and stimulates the palate, and a welcome addition to the top tier.
Unfortunately, this wine is a step down from previous vintages. The nose is pickled and herbal, and throughout there is a pounding vegetal quotient that can't be ignored. Good mouthfeel, but too much green bean for what should be an opulent, rich, full-fruit style of wine.
Elegant and tight, this blend offers savory tones of cured meat and dried fruit, followed by green notes of curry leaf and herb. The wine is tangy, thick and persistent on the palate.
This shows rustic aromas of barnyard and wet fur combined with espresso and toast. Despite a dense core of black fruit, this is bitter and astringent, with an abrupt finish.
Woodsy, lightly floral raspberry aromas are mild. This wine revolves around a light-framed, dilute body, while flavors of cranberry, raspberry and dusty earth finish woody but shallow, with a preserving shot of acidity.
Bright pink in color, this rosé is full in the mouth with red berry flavors and intense acidity. A touch of bitterness gives a sharp aftertaste.
Tastes too oaky and extracted, making the sweet wood, butterscotch, pear jam, peach cobbler and pineapple custard flavors a little obvious. But it will satisfy fans of this style.
This extended skin contact experiment from winemaker Ed Kurtzman was a success, its chamomile, lime and meringue-like scents framed by chalky minerality on the nose. The palate is tightly wound with saffron, lemon peel and grapefruit touches upheld by a persistent acidity that seemingly crescendoes on the finish.
Full bodied, flamboyant and opulent, this is a ripe, exotic rendering of 100% Marsanne. Honey, apricot and mandarin orange notes ease slowly over the palate, finishing with a lush richness that suggests drinking over the near term.
This wine is fresh and vibrant in acidity and structure, yet penetrating on the palate with sweet, ripe stonefruit and yellow floral notes. Hints of lime pith and jasmine tea add texture and astringency on the long, mineral-laden finish.
Rich and smoothly textured, this is rich with red berry fruits balanced by intense acidity. The structure is ripe, full of concentration from low-yield vines and ready for aging. Drink from 2017. This is from the Fer Servadou grape, similar to Cabernet Sauvignon, and known in Gaillac as Braucol. The estate, which spans both sides of the Tarn river, has been in the Hirissou family for six generations.
A blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Franc, this is a forward, fruity, almost sweet-tasting wine, considerably fruitier and less compelling than the previous vintage. Broad and accessible, with a pretty milk-chocolate finish, it's an easy sipper to enjoy while it's still in the bloom of youth.
The Kallisti offers exotic pineapple and tropical fruit aromas leading to a soft, layered palate of roasted nuts, citrus and vanilla. For fans of wines with a softer touch and some oak, this will be a hit. Pair with chicken, cheeses, richer dishes.
Aromas of reduction and overripe fruit are followed by off-dry flavors that lack cohesion.
With its light color, this is a soft and fruity wine that is now beginning to mature. Its red berries are acquiring a more barnyard character, while acidity is merging into the ripe texture. It's ready to drink.
Fine perfumes, some toast along with vanilla, and sweet, rich ripe fruit. Together, these attributes make a finely structured wine, packed with black fruits and soft tannins, with just a core of dryness. Screwcap.
Truffle, new leather, ripe plum, tilled soil and chopped herb are some of the aromas you'll find on this impressive red. Polished and powerfully structured, the palate delivers morello cherry, ripe blackberry, star anise and clove set against a backbone of tightly knit, velvety tannins that lend firm support and a smooth texture. Drink 2021–2031.
This wine brings out the variety's richness and depth of fruit flavors, while keeping the texture smooth and pleasing. It's very firm with tannins and acidity, yet not overly full-bodied. The ripe blackberry and cassis flavors have the intensity to match the structure and make for great balance overall.
Always a splendid wine, this 2010 does not disappoint. Complex, intense and fruity, it has tangy fruit; a tight, minerally texture; and an intense, steely character. As the wine develops over many years, it will deepen and round out.
A blend of Santa Cruz Mountains, Santa Lucia Highlands and Edna Valley, this is a tasty, easy-drinking Pinot. It's soft, with cola, cherry, raspberry, tea, licorice and cinnamon spice flavors, and finishes dry.
A taut wine with dense tannins and tight black-currant flavors. There is a stalky element here, although the wine's structure should soften over the next 2–3 years.
Alain and Céline Vidal's second brand (they also own Château Dubraud) is a fruity blend of Merlot (60%), Cabernet Sauvignon (25%) and Cabernet Franc (15%) although the smoky wood flavors also have an important place. Red berries and black currants partner with acidity and firm tannins. The wine is still developing so drink from 2016.
Aromas of hawthorn, flowering mint and sage lead the way. The palate offers green apple, lemon zest, and alpine herb alongside brisk acidity and a refined perlage. It finishes on a note of white almond.
This powerful white has an intriguing nose of toasted almonds, spiced orange and almond cookies while the mouth is an explosion of intense nut, cinnamon and honey, set against a noticeable level of residual sugar. A good wine to savor on its own. Drink over the next three to four years.
A very interesting Chardonnay, and easily worth the price. It was fermented in 50% new French oak, which gives it a creamy, smoky richness, while the underlying fruit flavors are ripe and rewarding, suggesting pineapples, Asian pears, green apples and Meyer lemons. A beautiful, complex and balanced wine.
Fresh-pressed boysenberries and blueberries meet with lilacs, Vietnamese coffee and a touch of cedar on the ripe, showy nose of this blend of 60% Grenache and 40% Syrah. The thick, coffee-laden palate is full of deep blueberry fruit, sure to be an attention-grabber yet serious enough with bitter espresso and sour-plum skins.
There are equal parts strawberry and earth in this Pinot, sourced from the who's who of vineyard sites in Russian River, including Toboni, Hallberg, Floodgate, Rochioli and Bacigalupi. The components come together in mesmerizing ways, making for a balanced and restrained Pinot that's fresh in strawberry and cherry as well as seasonings of herb and cinnamon spice, building power as it goes.
A new effort from Jigar Vineyards, sourcing some very good grapes, Sedition is light, clear and lingering on the palate in cherry-cola, mint and dried herb. Balanced and on the lighter side in terms of body and tannin, it's ready for the table, with a juicy, persistent finish.
Cadenzia is the term coined by McLaren Vale producers to describe their proprietary blends; this one is roughly equal proportions of Grenache, Shiraz, Mourvèdre and Tempranillo. The result is a dark-fruited wine laden with hints of cola, cedar and spice. Moderately firm in structure, with a long, slightly dusty finish; try 2012–2020.
From estate-grown grapes, this impressive bottling is moderately spicy, showing a floral flair on the nose. Medium bodied and soft on the palate, it shines in a depth of plum, leather and black pepper.
Lush and delicious, this is rich with complex berry, currant, cola, spice and cedar flavors. It's earthier and more rustic than the modern style of extreme softness and sweetness, but that's exactly what gives it such charm.
Soft and easy, with very ripe blackberry and currant flavors that veer into chocolate-covered raisins. Finishes a bit hot, but dry.
Dark berry and a light, tropical fruit quality on the nose add to the appeal of this Pinotage. On the palate, the flavors of juicy berry and banana are rounded and smooth, offering assertive spice but in a gentle package.
Mendocino's Anderson Valley is one of the best sources of Gewürztraminer in California, and this polished bottling shows why. The wine is brisk and clean, with potent flavors of tropical citrus fruits, flowers and a wild array of Asian spices, all wrapped into a creamy texture. It's a little sweet on the finish.
Named after the late Antonio Mastroberardino, this stunning wine opens with aromas of underbrush, dark cherry, tobacco, exotic spice and blue flower. The radiant palate seamlessly combines structure and finesse, delivering mature black cherry, juicy raspberry, white pepper, clove and licorice while bright acidity and firm, polished tannins provide balance. Hold for added complexity. Drink 2018–2033.
An austere nose gives way in time to smoky tobacco, red currant and minerally acidity, the wine intense on the palate without being over the top. Along the way, hits of cedar and milk chocolate complement the proceedings.
The bouquet has a lot of burnt character, particularly rubber, and the palate has too much corn, citrus pith and peach pit. Shows vibrant acidity but little finesse.
There's a beautifully aged quality to this luminous vin santo from Montepulciano, Tuscany that recalls etched stone or finely crushed white pepper. Beyond that are generous tones of resin, butterscotch and candied orange. The mouthfeel is creamy, soft and rich.
This is a ripe, fruity wine that has both tannins and generous of black fruits. The combination has produced a rounded, fruity wine that is sustained by its structure although it is very ready to drink now.
This pale, cotton candy hued wine contains muted aromas of strawberry hull and raspberry. The flavors are ripe and fruity, with a hint of orange blossom. It's light bodied, but the ripe-fruit sweetness is almost textural.
The wine has fine, juicy fruit over smooth tannins. Its smoky flavors, touches of wood aging and rich tannic structure are integrating well. It will be ready to drink from 2020.
An ambitious wine that doesn't live up to its reserve status. Most of the parts are here, from the ripe tannins and fine acidity to the moderate alcohol and toasty oak, but the currant flavors finish too thin for ageability, or to justify the price.
An amazingly perfumed wine, which shows great tannins and ripe fruit. It has a fine structure, packed with smoky wood and blackberry flavors. It is still young, but wait for its dark fruit to open out, and for its ripe, intense violets and tarry flavors to balance, and it will be an impressive wine.
On the dry side for a kabinett, with the alcohol weighing in at 11%. Yet even though the alcohol is relatively high, the wine gives an impression of lightness, balancing melon and white peach flavors with touches of spice and minerality. Drink now–2012.
One of Geoff Merrill's newest wines, the Liquid Asset's label is designed to look like a bank check. It's a pretty sophisticated blend for its intended, entry-level market, with black cherry notes dominating. It's an easy, enjoyable quaff and a red that I could even (gasp!) imagine chilling. 80% Shiraz, 15% Grenache, 5% Viognier.
Waxy aromas of dried stone fruits and potent oak open this classy barrel-fermented Viura. A refined palate with cutting acidity energizes woody pear and apple flavors. On the finish, resiny oak and a wave of oxidized Sherry notes are highly complex but maybe not for everyone.
This second wine from the estate offers spice and mushroom aromas that indicate it's now mature. Ripe and smooth, with attractive secondary flavors, it's spicy, meaty and ready to drink.
Crushed mineral and dried sage aromas belie the intensity of fresh nectarine and apricot flavors in this spry, invigorating wine. Striking acidity lends a delicate, lacy mouthfeel accentuated by a sheen of minerality.
Gerbino is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Nero d'Avola and Syrah that offers an awkward bouquet of red fruit, bitter almond and tangy dill. A charred burnt note also appears on the close.
A rich and developed Chard with notes of toasted brioche, almond skins, lightly baked red apple and orange oil on the nose and mouth. Well balanced with a full but not flabby mouth, moderate acidity and a lingering finish.
Dark yellow in color, this wine shows tangy green apple and a richer, more concentrated element of apple-spice cake, with supportive, balanced acidity. With a bright, lifted finish, this less-expensive offering compared with many of the producer's single-vineyard designates never lets up on complexity or deliciousness.
This offers subdued aromas suggesting orchard fruit and pressed yellow flower. The straightforward, rather lean palate offers citrus, saline and a hint of green pear alongside fresh acidity.
Generic black fruit aromas are accompanied by mocha, heat and lemony oak. Feels tannic and choppy, with herbal berry fruit flavors. Lively but pointed and jagged on the finish.
Marked by ripe flavors of raspberry and cherry jam, blueberry pie with the crust and black pepper, this Zin's fruit is the star. It's a little on the soft, direct side, but sure is delicious. Drink now.
Notions of very ripe peaches lead onto a tight, fresh and zesty palate where you can still catch glimpses of that peach. A rounded and fruity number, not without precision.
Here's a light and tonic expression of Nebbiolo (in a specially designed curvy bottle) with pretty aromas of wild berries, moist earth and forest floor. The color is a light and luminous ruby and the mouthfeel is equally streamlined and fresh. Firm tannins and intense flavors of smoke and cedar build momentum on the palate.
With rich tropical fruits and a ripe, opulent feel, this is a full-bodied wine. It has weight, layers of toast and apricot and peach flavors. Soft and round, it could be drunk now, although it would be best to wait until 2015.
A blend of Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling and Pinot Gris. It's crisp and clean in acidity, with zesty flavors of pineapples, oranges, mangoes and vanilla. If only it were drier, the score would be much higher.
Without any dosage, this bone-dry wine has shocking initial acidity that then opens up to allow the attractive white fruits and mineral character to shine. It is six years old, but it still tastes young and should be kept until 2017.
Gorgeously aromatic with notes of white blossoms and waxy lime and lemon skins, this dry, delicately composed Riesling is a stunner. Tart mango and and tangerine flavors are juicy on the palate, accented with lemon verbena and a lingering waxiness. It finishes remarkably long with a streak of lemon acidity and a zesty astringency. Delicious now for its youth and exuberance, but likely to develop well over through 2021–2024.
This blend from Matthews is 47% Merlot and 33% Cabernet Sauvignon, with smaller amounts of Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Malbec. It's thoroughly New World in style: thick, smoky, tannic and concentrated, with notes of black cherry and cassis at the core.
This informal red shows subdued iris and baking spice aromas. It's easygoing on the palate, with raspberry fruit, a bitter almond note and smooth tannins. Enjoy soon.
A juicy, jammy blend of 50% Sangiovese, 25% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Montepulciano and 8% Zinfandel sourced primarily from Contra Costa County that's packed with blue and blackberry fruit, tobacco and plum. Clean and bright with a chewy texture.
Late harvest fruit and 12 months of oak aging give this wine a deep, full and sophisticated personality. It exudes notes of apricot, lemon curd, vanilla and white almond paste.
Maybe you've seen the cool yellow wrapper with a shapely woman that   adorns this versatile Cava, but what's inside merits attention as well. After melon, banana and spice aromas the palate takes over with citrus and mango   flavors. Distinguished due to its solid mouthfeel and good natural carbonation. Pour on its own, with food or in a mimosa.
Mainly Cabernet, with some Merlot and Malbec added for depth and complexity, this rich, dry wine has jammy blackberry, dark chocolate and oak flavors. It's compromised by sharp acidity that rattles the palate. Drink soon.
A distinctive aroma like ripe peaches and fennel and full, almost sweet fruit and spice flavors give this medium-bodied wine personality. The texture is soft and luscious rather than lively, and practically coats the mouth from sip to sip.
A more intense version of Carraovejas's Reserva from 2012, this also includes more than 20% Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. Thus it's spicy and prickly on the nose, with road tar and peppery notes in addition to potent berry fruit. A rich saturated rumbling palate deals coffee, toast, blackberry and herbal flavors that are much like the Reserva but more amplified. A charred finish has a lemony ring to it. Drink from 2020 through 2030.
This screaming vintage of Secreto is the living definition of pungency. Immediately it hits with fierce gooseberry and nettle aromas along with passion fruit and grapefruit. The palate is acidic and searing, with tangy, cool-climate flavors of lime and passion fruit. On the finish, this zinger is firm as concrete.
The western slopes of Sonoma Mountain, hit by cool maritime breezes, are ideal for Pinot Noir, although little is grown there. This excellent example is dry and in structure and enormously dense in flavor, offering masses of cherry pie filling, plum sauce, sandalwood and spice that are a touch hot in alcohol.
The latest vintage of this popular brand continues the same ripe, soft character as before. Red berry fruits, balanced acidity and a rounded aftertaste all contribute to a wine that is ready to drink.
L'O is designed as a lean, approachable wine and consequently delivers cherry cola, lightly toasted nut and pencil lead. It is thorny and nervous at times but comes together nicely in the mouth.
This is a frothy and foamy sweet-smelling Prosecco with pretty aromas of chopped fruit, kiwi and white peach. The active bubbling helps make the wine taste very creamy and smooth in the mouth and that characteristic sweetness kicks in on the finale.
88-90 Barrel sample. A ripe, smooth, almost velvety wine that has big depths of flavor and solid tannins, but seems one-dimensional in its profile.
This is overripe and raisiny, no two ways about it. Hailing from a very hot year, this feels flat and flabby, while raisin and prune are the dominant flavors. Blatant overripeness and a ton of weight render this out of balance.
Aromas of dark-skinned berry, exotic spice and wildflower lead the nose on this concentrated but refined wine.

A soft, round Merlot made from what tastes like extremely ripe fruit, slightly sweet with flavors of spicy cinnamon, cola and plum.
Super-tannic, one of those dry Napa red wines that makes you wonder why you opened it now. It's just so tough and astringent, offering more pain than pleasure, which leads to the question, will it age? Well, there's good cherry-blackberry fruit. But this is Merlot, not Cabernet. Risky.
A wine to remember for its spicy pepper scents and vibrantly fresh acidity, this is complex and layered, moderate in acidity yet amply juicy in blackberry and blueberry fruit. Hints of spice, sage and lavender linger impressively on the finish.
Ripe apple and peach aromas are numbed by a heavy mineral note. Generic but very pleasant flavors of citrus, melon and white pepper do the trick. Stony and crisp, and clear as polished glass on the finish. Just not terribly complex, however. Imported by Weygandt-Metzler.

Dry and rather rustic, this Syrah has some green minty flavors alongside the blackberries, and the tannins are on the harsh side. But the price isn't bad. Give it a chance with babyback ribs.
A dry, gritty red wine, lusty and tannic. The blackberry, cassis liqueur and smoky oak flavors suggest pairing with charred steak.

This riserva Brunello offers plenty of dark intensity and fruity concentration with tones of tobacco, cassis, plum, cigar box and blackberry preserves. The thickness and fullness of the bouquet is broken down by the freshness of the mouthfeel and those dry, elegant tannins.
The flavors of this Cabernet are enormously rich. Blackberry and blueberry jam, black currant, dark chocolate and cassis come in waves. Few wines on earth are this ripe. The issue is balance and complexity, both of which could be stronger. Drink over the next few years.
Lutum is a project from Santa Barbara vintner Gavin Chanin. The brand sources fruit from well-known vineyards, in this case Rinconada, situated in a favorable terroir in the southern part of the appellation.

Delicious now, it will age well until at least 2022.
A medium-sweet sparkling wine, this bursts with a ripe apple flavor on the palate. The wine is crisp, deliciously clean and refreshing. Think of it like Moscato.
This vintage aged Brut Prosecco offers a sophisticated twist of mature melon and apricot lavished over a creamy, soft mouthfeel. Pair this wine with spicy barbecue chicken wings.

Hard tannins make this wine difficult to approach now, as they usually do for young Duckhorn Cabs. But it's quite a success for the chilly 2010 vintage, showing lush blackberry and cherry fruits and fine acidity. As tough as the tannins are, they're well structured, a strong suggestion that the wine, which includes Merlot, should have an easy time aging.  Start drinking it in 2016.

A decadent, extroverted style, with sweet flowers, overripe apricots and a honeysuckle character that is saved from being cloying by a shining streak of acidity. Try with Malaysian food. Drink now to 2014.
This is a smooth, rounded wine, showing the elegant side of this Portuguese version of Tempranillo. It certainly has richness, but this is well handled, leaving a delicious, fruity wine to drink now.
From the celebrated Cannubi Boschis cru, here's a bright and luminous Barolo that opens with a deep ruby color and aromas of cherry, cola and cassis. Black fruit, tar and spice appear on the palate and the wine tastes tart, plumy and surprisingly succulent compared to most Nebbiolo-based wines.
Aromas of red-skinned berry, underbrush and leather lead into a medium-bodied palate that offers cherry, tobacco and a hint of white pepper. It's rather straightforward and already approachable so drink over the next few years.

Aromas include ripe black fruit, spice, savory herb and a balsamic note. The tight palate offers black raspberry, crushed blackberry, menthol and sage alongside a firmly tannic backbone. A licorice note signals the finish. It's still young and a little astringent on the close. Drink after 2016.
Quite saucy and spicy upon first blush, with a heavy bouquet. Here's a wine that holds nothing back; it is compact, tight and hard on the palate, but it tastes meaty, big and generous, with plum and chocolate flavors. Finishes with heat, rusticity and peppery power. A brawny wine that shoots high but doesn't hit every target.
This doesn't taste true to the grape variety, but it's a good white wine with orange peel, jasmine and tangerine aromas, fairly quiet fruit flavors and then a floral, citrus finish. Light to medium bodied, it has an appetizing texture.
A fruity wine, it's packed with citrus, freshly peeled apples and white peaches. Acidity cuts through the ripeness, giving total freshness at this stage. It's a wine to be drunk for its fruitiness now, or aged until 2018 for more complex flavors.
This Slovenian sparkling wine is made from 100% Ribolla Gialla in the Charmat method. It has aromas of green apple, brioche, toast and hazelnut. In the mouth, the bubbles are pleasant and prepare your palate for flavors of apple, hazelnut and toasted almond.
Aromas of toasted nut, citrus and oak lead the nose. The linear, rather lean palate shows yellow apple skin, bitter almond and lime zest. A mineral note signals the finish.
Michel Laroche has been branching out of Chablis in recent years and his southern French effort has some chlorine notes along with aromas of mint and sweet wood. The power is up there, but there isn't suppleness to match. The palate pulsates while the finish is dark and sharp, with a burnt flavor.
This bargain-basement Australian is oddly lacking in fruit, offering up herbaceous and pine scents instead. Flavor is likewise scarce on the crisp palate and the short finish. No tannins in sight.
Red berry, crushed stone and herbs aromas open. The vibrant, polished palate delivers tart cherry, strawberry, tangerine and a hint of pastry alongside zesty acidity and small, persistent bubbles.
Made from several high-class sites, including Hyde Vineyard and Beckstoffer's Carneros Lake/Las Amigas Vineyard, this is a cooler-climate, 100% varietal wine. Juicy in crisp red fruit, it also has elements of pencil lead and cedar, giving an edginess of savory complexity that's interesting and long-lasting.
Subdued pineapple, lemon and orange blossom on the nose give way to similar notes on the palate, plus a slight guava note. Thin in feel, it does have a crispness that lasts through the tart finish.
From a 250-acre vineyard on the slopes of the Entre-deux-Mers above the Garonne river, this wine is silky smooth, attractively balanced with wood and soft but dry tannins. Flavors of dark chocolate, black plums and spice from the wood all blend together well. To finish, there is good acidity.
Smells and tastes a little weedy, with green, stalky notes, but saved from disgrace by the pretty blackberry flavors and rich texture. Dry, with firm but easy tannins and good acids, this is a nice everyday sipper at a fair price.
Easy to ripen, hard to achieve balance and elegance. That's Viognier, and Iron Horse does one of the better jobs. That's because in addition to tropical fruit, citrus, flower and spicy flavors, the wine is very dry and acidic. In this case there's a bit of oak but just enough to add a touch of cream.
Cola and red-cherry aromas grow more complex with touches of rose, nori wrapper and purple flowers on the nose of this bottling. The mouthfeel is soft and the flavors are broad, with candied red cherry, rose petals and an elegant hibiscus-thyme tension, like an herb-laced fruit punch.
The purest scent of fresh, ripe red cherries is the first pleasure to be encountered on this elegant wine. On the slender palate this lovely fruit expression is joined by earthier tones of undergrowth and peat. There is a central seam of freshness that pulls fruit, silky tannin and soft texture together. If there was just one attribute I could name it would be elegance. Lovely and fresh now but Rosenberg ages most gracefully. Drink 2016–2024.
A good, supple red wine, made from an unusual blend of Cabernet, Petite Sirah, Zinfandel and Mourvèdre. It's soft and fruity in raspberries, vanilla and toast, and is slightly sweet. The alcohol is 15.5%.
Another stellar El Puntido, this time with excellent concentration and full-load aromas of black fruit, leather, fine dried cheese and cola. The palate is tight, properly stretched and racy, with bursting black raspberry and cassis flavors. Coconut and resin on the finish is the first and only glaring announcement of oak. Drink now through 2014.
Seems as though St. Lucas's white wines are more sturdy than its reds. This Chard is fleshy and won't last much longer, but for dense melon, peach and cider-like flavors and relatively good balance, it's making the grade. Plump and tropical on the finish as it battles to stay in line.
Cranberry, pomegranate and a touch of bramble are found in the nose. The palate reveals fresh fruit flavors of sour red cherry, cranberry and red plum with a pleasant acidic backbone. Drink now or hold through 2016.
Light-bodied, straightforward red, with blackberry aromas, this wine could be accentuated with chilling and is a solution for cuisine such as mixed charuterie platters or liver terrines. A friendly, uncomplicated red made for the moment, with gracious, cheerful fruitiness.
Light in body and pungent almost to the point of sweatiness, with leafy, herbal flavors that soften on the finish.
100% Cabernet Sauvignon, this opens with aromas of cassis, cedar, tobacco and dried Mediterranean herbs. The concentrated palate delivers licorice, black currants, dried plum, coffee, clove and chocolate alongside bracing but fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2016–2022.

Viscous and wildly concentrated, it leaves a lasting impression on glassware and palate alike.
A blend of Touriga Nacional and Tinta Roriz, with big, dusty tannins, ripe new wood and black, jammy fruit. The exuberance is held in check by minerality, but the final effect is of a ripe, satisfying wine, the spicy new wood showing strongly.
Rubbery and leathery smelling at first, with berry and cassis aromas resting below the surface. Feels tannic and closed on the palate, with syrupy, reduced plum, berry and currant flavors. Not too much shows up on the finish other than thickness and a subtle plum nuance.
The winery has sourced this wine from their coastal vineyards, which accounts for its acidity and long hangtime raspberry, persimmon and sour-cherry candy flavors. With a silky texture, it's lovely to drink now.
Lightly roasted and stalky on the nose, this shows dry aromas of cherry and raspberry along with earthy spice notes. The palate offers proper balance and nothing complicated. Flavors of oak-driven spice, cinnamon and pepper accent earthy plum and berry, while the finish is smooth but a touch hot. Drink through 2017.
A very fresh, very crisp wine that has initially shocking acidity. Then, as it opens up, more subtle apple and citrus fruits appear, keeping the cool character of the wine while adding more complexity.
Structured in firm tannins, this seamless wine offers juicy red cherry and strawberry most significantly, followed by dried herb and hits of baking spice. Layered without being overly concentrated, it's made and owned by Chris Pittenger, who also makes Rhône-inspired wines for Skinner Vineyards in El Dorado County. The name honors wife Sarah's rounded belly while expecting the couple's first child.
Light in flavor, with pale red fruits, this includes 17% Cabernet and 6% Merlot. It has an underlying herbal, green olive character, but it's a decent, all-purpose bottle of red.

A bit voluptuous in style, this bold, round Chardonnay accents fresh apple and pear with slick tones of buttered popcorn and toast. It's rich and silky in mouthfeel with a lingering kiss of warmth on the finish.
This is a full-bodied, fruit-laden wine that sells for a bargain price. Guava, citrus and peach flavors mix on the palate, which features low acidity and a dusting of tannins that adds a touch of grip to the off-dry finish. Drink now. Imported by Trinchero Vineyards.
There's quite a bit of oak on this wine, in the way of smoky, ashy toast and dill notes. Lees aging adds richer winemaker complications of cream and sourdough. With lemon, lime, nectarine and peach flavors, it's dryishly sweet, soft and easy to drink now.
Round, simple and easy to enjoy if you don't mind a lack of Viognier typicity replaced by chunky apple aromas and flavors. There's also some citrus and apricot to bulk up the flavor profile. Overall it's a full-bodied but indifferent white. Drink right away for best results.
Deep ruby in the glass, this wine has a bouquet of black currant, flint and bell pepper. A restrained tannic structure supports flavors of blackberry, damson plum, elderberry, violet and espresso with an added touch of bramble. The finish is marked by a note of fresh summer plum.
Well defined citrus and apple flavors abound, along with touches of yellow and green fruit. There's a hint of unripe papaya also, and if the wine spent any time in new oak, it's not evident.
A soft style, indicating a higher dosage, that produces simple fruits but also a level of bitterness. The wine is a disappointment from such a famous name.
The name means “Sea of Vines,” and that's what you see in Rías Baixas. Here, we have a dry, crisp white with apple and apricot on the nose and a bit of roundness, weight and chunkiness in the mouth. Tastes of pithy apple and apricot, with mild bitterness on the finish. Drink now.
This is a very aromatic wine, full of rose-petal aromas. A palate of ripe strawberries, soft acidity and a rich texture finishes on a high note of tangy lemon and raspberries.
After wading through some burn and heat on the nose, things settle on basic red fruit. The feel is fresh and zesty, while flavors of plum and berry are about as average and normal as they come. Feels racy, slick and quick on the finish.
This is going to be a fine fruity wine once its firm tannins have calmed down. It has enough black-fruit flavors and acidity to ensure that it will be perfumed, ripe and fresh at the same time. Drink starting from 2017.
The winery offers this bottling as a counterpart to their dry Riesling, but there's not much separation between the two. Its 10 g/L of residual sugar is certainly above threshhold, but with the searingly tart acidity underneath, it barely makes a dent. Citrus and apple flavors come through, but the sour lemon acidity is what dominates.
Sweet and simple. Shows crisp acidity, but tastes like melted apricot and pineapple jelly.
Black fruit and taut structure are joined with black currant acidity and a core of the driest tannins. The wine has the cool 2007 feel to it, and is certainly ready to drink now.

Here's a Riserva Barolo from the excellent 2004 vintage with elegant and traditional characteristics and evolved aromas of smoked meat, pressed fruit, chopped spice and moist earth. The wine seems older than it is and ends with meaty flavors of cured beef and honey roasted ham.
While ethereal in structure, there's a seductively penetrating appeal to this light-footed Pinot Noir. Initially pronounced notes of smoke, dried herb and cedar fade into a dusty rose and cherry perfume. Blossom and sage aromas extend into the palate, lending a sultry flair to brisk Maraschino cherry and raspberry flavors. The finish extends on a pleasant bite of bitter almond.
This Pinot's acidity, tannins and juvenile fruit suggest time in the cellar. It's rich in raspberries, plums and cherries, with the interesting note of sweet heirloom tomato you sometimes get from Carneros. The narrow window of drinkability is 2015–2017.
This wine begins with a clean and cool nose featuring green banana and other subdued tropical notes as well as salty seaspray. Once sipped, the tropical side emerges more, with papaya and guava, as well as overripe peach. Altogether, the alcohol feels a bit high.
As the name implies, it's a soft, gentle wine. Quality has varied over the years. The '04 is one of the better vintages, a complex but accessible wine with polished black currant, dark- chocolate truffle and anise liqueur flavors. Drink now and through 2010.
The main nonvintage wine from Veuve Doussot is soft, creamy with plenty of ripe, fresh fruits. Pears and apricots come to the fore and are attractively cut by the lime acidity. Around this fruit, there's good mineral tightness and finishing acidity.
There's a nice, melony center to this wine, with suggestions of lightly spiced pears and green apples. The fruit is lively and pure, and the wine has a nice lift to it. The spices kick in at midpalate and carry through a long and thoroughly satisfying finish. Very good winemaking in an elegant style; the alcohol clocks in at a sensible 13%.
This is a delicate, peach-colored rosé from Mount Etna with fine layers of mineral, stone fruit, wild flowers and freshly picked raspberries. There are no sharp edges in the mouth and this smooth wine slides down the palate with elegant determination.
What distinguishes the Stony Block from the winery's other selections is its minerality, but also a fluidity in the wine—as if the rocks were melted into the fruit. The raspberry, pomegranate and cola flavors are classic. This surely is a wine to age. Drink from 2016 and beyond.
A captivating Chard that shows impeccable balance, and the price is very good for this level of quality. The fruit is brilliantly ripe in green apple, kiwi, Asian pear and lime flavors, with a deft touch of smoky oak. A firm minerality undergirds the structure.
Young and tight, this is packed with bright berry fruit annotated with brown spices. There are streaks of sandalwood and mocha, and the flavors smooth out nicely as it glides into a lingering, delicious finish.
The historic Ceretto estate excels in the production of crisp whites and important red wines. That same attention to detail is paid to this informal expression of Dolcetto. Aromas here recall cherry cola and blueberry and the wine boasts a bright, saturated color and a palate-cleansing finish.
Rustic and dry, this has flavors of berries, currants, licorice and spices. Made from Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon.
Basic tropical-fruit aromas settle on pineapple. This unoaked chardonnay is melony on the palate, with ample acidity. Heavy, ripe flavors of peach, melon and pear turn towards mango on the finish.
Motto Piane delivers a huge and sophisticated style (thanks to late-harvest fruit) with enormous intensity and thick glycerin streaks visible down the side of the glass. Aromas here include crushed white peppercorn, dried sage, almond paste and mature fruit.
This shows elegant and linear traits of smoky mineral and dried berry, backed by savory layers of cured meat and leather. Having spent 18 months maturing in oak, this has a soft, rich approach on the palate.
This Shiraz is medium-bodied and full of black cherry aromas and flavors. Dry, tealike tannins complete the picture. An enjoyable pizza or pasta accompaniment, though its price may prohibit casual, everyday consumption.
91-93 Barrel sample. Full, ripe fruit, showing pear jucie, some wood spice and ripeness. It feels fat, full-bodied.

A blend of 80% Sangiovese, 10% Canaiolo and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon, this starts with aromas of red berry, blue flower and spice. The juicy palate serves up black cherry and cinnamon-spice along with notes of espresso. It's soft and one-dimensional but delicious none the less.
This wine's bouquet is peppery, meaty, spicy and altogether honest. The palate feels frisky and juicy, not heavy or flat, then tastes of char, black coffee, cola and spiced, herb-tinged berry. The finish is long, toasty and snappy.
This opens with aromas suggesting grilled herb and ripe orchard fruit. Bright and linear, the palate offers pear, peach and aromatic herb while a hint of citrus zest marks the finish.
The label points out that this is barrel fermented, but a sniff and sip will tell you that much. The nose pumps petrol at first and then plenty of smoky wood. In the mouth, it's immensely round and chewy, with vanilla, coconut, banana and peach flavors. Broad but zesty enough, which allows the heavy toast element to work.
Here's a concentrated and bright Barbera d'Asti Superiore with aromas of cherry, tobacco and tea leaf that are delivered in an intense and immediate manner. The wine is soft and velvety in the mouth thanks to the high extraction and despite the natural acidity.

The name Gemischter Satz means a field blend of grapes, often old and rare varieties, an Austrian tradition. The wine is light, fresh and crisp, with just a slight prickle on the tongue. There is a creamy character, lying well with the spicy element. Screwcap.
A lovely Chardonnay, dry, elegant and minerally. Displays real control, with the pineapple, lemondrop candy, apricot and oak flavors balanced by crisp acidity. Easily as good as Chards costing far more, which makes it a value.
With this brut-style wine, Domaine Carneros competes against California's most serious sparkling wine contenders. It is certainly the finest Le Rêve ever, glamorous and provocative, massively flavored in lemon, lime and tangerine flavors, yet balanced and elegant, with the doughy tartness of Champagne. A great achievement.
Nicely perfumed on the nose, this Merlot has 10% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Syrah blended in, giving it a well-rounded composition and bright black cherry around firm, still prominent tannins. It could use some time in the cellar, through 2018, or a decant.

This opens with sensations of underbrush, tobacco, espresso and toasted notes. The extracted palate displays stewed fruit sensations, oak, vanilla, roasted coffee bean and searing alcohol. It's already evolved and ends on an almost sugary-sweet note.
Crusty on the nose, this has an asphalt note that transitions into hard spice and sour berry notes. It has flavors of creamy, minty oak and medicinal berry fruit. A lasting flavor of oak-driven spice and a hint of green carry some heat.
Highly complex and intriguing, given that it's also quite rich, extracted and modern. The color is violet, while the nose is bloated with cured meat, vanilla and dark cherry fruit. Rather thick and chewy, but balanced by proper acidity. A gem of wine, with a luscious mouthfeel.
All-stainless fermented, this flavorful Pinot Gris displays fleshy, ripe pear flavors, with a light dusting of cinnamon spice. Simply delicious, and ready right now.
Examples of this variety are rare in the state. Aromas pop with heaping amounts of fresh flowers and orange peel that are reminiscent of freesia in their intensity. The coffee and blue-fruit flavors are smooth and sultry, showing pleasing depth.
As the entry-level Chardonnay from one of Margaret River's most highly lauded producers, this has a creamy opulence to it, with notes of buttercups, lemon drops and toasty oak. The palate is of medium weight, with a viscous texture and a good lick of acidity to keep things fresh, but the oak is a little flashy, particularly on the finish.
A full-bodied, bold and dense selection. Upfront aromas of all-fruit preserves and brambly berries are warmed by hints of licorice, curing spice and game.

It's attractive now, but will shine with a bit more maturity; try after 2018.

Rich and dry, with a wealth of flavor that immediately takes over and doesn't let up. Raspberries, cherries, mocha, vanilla and crushed hardspice notes are wrapped in a silky texture leading to a long, refined finish.
This is a wine made for the cellar. It's dark, and smells rich, with ripe blackberry and plum fruit and a hefty dose of vanilla-scented, smoky oak. Full-bodied, but the tannins are hefty now, and the acidity is high. Probably best to put it away for four or five years and see what happens.
At this stage, this wine is closed, tight and mineral in character. As befits a great Perrières, it will be a serious, structured wine, textured and full of nervy, steely feeling, softening later into mature spice and toast. Drink from 2016.

This is two-thirds Grenache, the balance divided equally between Syrah and Mourvèdre. It's a fruity mix of berry and plum flavors, with added spice and a lick of chocolate from aging in once-used French oak barrels. Relatively light, very clean and best for drinking young.
Despite its youth, this is a complete and satisfying wine. Woodward Canyon reds virtually always develop well in bottle, and so you can assume that this will continue to improve. At the moment it is tightly wound, firmly built, a complex weave of purple fruit and tobacco leaf, leading into white chocolaty tannins.

This winery produces a slew of Pinot Noirs each year, and this specific clonal study shows clove and cardamom on the somewhat subdued nose. The flavors are more forward, dominated by black tea and cherry, with a touch of tannin.
A vitamin pill scent greets you immediately, somewhat masking the fruit. In the mouth it's rather light, watery and showing green apple fruit with plenty of acid. The finish softens up but doesn't add any depth or flavor.
Apple custard, green apple peels and a bit of barrel warmth entertain the nose on this reasonably priced wine from a highly reliable appellation. Flavors are straightforward, with ripe golden pears and lemon peels.
The wine comes from a large estate east of Aix-en-Provence. With its light fruitiness and attractive acidity, the wine is ripe with red-berry fruits and finishes with a fine crisp aftertaste. The wine is refreshing and very drinkable now.
For a sense of class, elevation and style that doesn't cost an arm and a leg, this blend of Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon is very much worth a go.

Beautifully balanced, this offers the perfect expression of Washington State brightness and a Bordeaux-like herbal component. The tannins are fine and drying, and the wine is polished, with plenty of astringent, herbal flavors in the finish. Don't look for big fruit here, but for a Euro style, this is a sure bet.
Quite ripe for a traditional crianza. The bouquet starts out on the stewy side but soon sheds its weight to reveal flavors of blackberry, black cherry and earth. The mouthfeel is a bit creamy due to the wine's mild oak and overall ripeness. Drink now through 2010.
Aromas of rubber, leafy red fruit and herbal raspberry are solid. It's crisp in the mouth, with raspy tannins supporting tight cherry and raspberry flavors. Finishes like it flows, with firm acidity and zest more than richness, leaving a hint of creamy vanilla and heat as it fades away.
Delightfully perfumed wine, revealing all the richness of 2009 while preserving the red fruits and acidity. Lively, ripe and ready to drink.
The Fire Red is a four grape Bordeaux blend, with an interesting flavor mix that runs through red and black berries, cassis, cedar, smoke and dark chocolate. The 21 months in barrel (French and American) shows well, and the fruit and acids balance nicely against the roasty toasty espresso in the finish. Give it an hour or two to breathe and the midpalate fills in nicely.
Here is an utterly irresistible wine—spicy, sensuous and layered with beautifully ripened citrus, tree and tropical fruits. A whiff of pine needle continues as a flavor thread, along with vanilla, buttered nuts, lemongrass and macaroon. This wine just keeps on going.

It's firmly textured with gripping tannins and a long finish.
Straightforward Australian Shiraz, combining mulberry fruit with vanilla oak. It lacks richness and expansiveness on the palate. A solid effort, but a bit of a disappointment given the history of the label and the suggested pricing.

Following the current fashion in Portugal for single-varietal wines, this is a rich, structured take on what has become the country's national grape. Powerful and with a dense structure, it retains some of the perfumed elegance that is one of Touriga Nacional's hallmarks. The tannins will age further and the fruit will come out more strongly. Drink from 2018.

This gorgeous expression boasts an intense bouquet of stone fruit, flint and Mediterranean herbs. The juicy palate delivers concentrated peach, citrus and pink grapefruit flavors, accented by mineral and mint. It has structure, elegance and incredible energy.

Trentadue's La Storia bottlings are their reserves, and the designation is justified for this Zin.

What a step up this is from the winery's Are You Game? bottling. The acids are a little edgy, but they serve to highlight the wine's savory complexities and brighten the fruit well into the red spectrum. Cherries and earth glide to a long, finely textured finish. Drink now–2020.

The blend is Syrah and Petite Sirah.
This is a very pale Pinot Noir—you can almost read through it. It's also light and simple in texture, with some polished flavors of raspberries, Dr. Pepper and spices. It finishes dry and crisp in acidity.
Varietally typical aromas of grapefruit and green onion start it off, but the palate is more citrusy, as it emphasizes flavors of orange, grapefruit, passion fruit and some pickle.

Rather lean, with high acidity, the wine has red currant fruits, a taut texture and a light spice character.

Aloof and resistant, this Pinot is almost rustic. The vineyard is at the coolest “deep end” of Anderson Valley, and the chilly vintage has accentuated the acids and tannins. There's a complex core of flavor, however, suggesting cherries, pomegranates, sautéed wild mushrooms and cured meats. All indications are of ageability; give it 68 years in a proper cellar.

A brilliant wine that shows the world how delicious young Napa Valley Cabernet can be. Just dazzles with the richness and purity of blackberry, mocha, leather and cedar flavors, with a finish you can measure in minutes. Bordeaux yearns for such ripeness. Terrific now and through 2015.
Shows the ripe pineapple fruit, acidity, minerality and above all sweet, smoky oak that mark a rich California Chardonnay. But there's something off. Hard to say exactly what, but it's in the taste. Like a smattering of mold or shriveled grapes that's off-putting.
Shows off the TL barrel regime, with toasty, mealy notes and hints of vanilla that come close to overwhelming the honeyed pear fruit. Turns fresh and pineapple-y on the finish, so give it another year in the bottle to knit all its pieces together.
Tightly closed like a fist, the only intimation of flavor is the seam of lemon-zest acidity. Purity and precision are stony straightjackets that this wine will never escape, but its aromatic development will yield ample pleasure for the patient. Drink as of 2017.

Open after 2012.
Very oaky, with scads of toast, caramel and smoky vanilla, and the Cabernet Sauvignon fruit stars with its cassis flavors. This is a dark, rich wine, young in tannins, bone dry, and easily on a par with the wonderful '01. This bottling is raising the Cabernet bar in Paso Robles.
The Alvarinho grape, more at home in northern Portugal, makes a fine wine in the Alentejo hill country northeast of Lisbon. Here the flavors are tropical: ripe pineapple, a touch of spice and just the right amount of acidity. The wine will be better from 2017.
The rare ripeness of the 2009 vintage is shown in the high alcohol, for Beaujolais at least, of this wine. Not that it shows, except in weight. The acidity is right there along with ripe plums. An ageworthy, finely concentrated wine.
Seems very well made, with impressive flavors of blackberries and black currants, touched with smoky oak, and encased in firm tannins. Texture and balance are everything in these Cabs, and this wine is not lacking in either. The tannic astringency strongly suggests midterm aging, through 2013, at least.
This contains a higher proportion of Roussanne than Nalys's regular white cuvée, and more barrel influence as well. Toast accents pineapple, melon and honey flavors, finishing clean and pleasant.
Intensely herbal, this is a crisp, cool wine. Layers of citrus, grapefruit and gooseberry mingle with grassy, herbal flavors. Green, fresh and drinkable now, this is a fine apéritif style.

From the estate vineyard on the Silverado Trail, this is always one of the better Napa Valley Chardonnay bottlings. The wine is rich in pineapple, pear, green apple and oak flavors, and is a little sweet. But it has brisk acidity and a nice scour of minerality. Drink now.
This is the second label of Young Inglewood, a blend of 93% Cabernet Sauvignon, 4% Cabernet Franc and 1% Petit Verdot that spent 20 months in all-French oak, one quarter of it new. Meant to be approachable young, it is, while retaining a concentration of licorice, black currant and blackberry wrapped in dark chocolate. Firm tannins give it structure.
This wine has tannins and a solid structure that is balanced by the bright red fruits. The wine is juicy, fruity and ready to drink.
Tastes too oaky, with overwhelming smoky caramel, vanilla extract and buttered toast notes that swamp the underlying pineapples and peaches. In this case, you're better off with Gainey's regular 2007 Chard, which costs a lot less.
Bright, fragrant, youthful and fruity, this is an attractive wine. Almost purple in color, it has soft tannins that add just a light touch of texture. Enjoy this wine now. Screwcap.
This blend of 72% Rousanne, 16% Viognier and 12% Marsanne is creamy and lush, powered with flavors of pears and pineapple, light spice, light floral and citrus. A creamy, vanilla bean character is emerging as the wine gets some extra bottle time, and there is just the right touch of citrus rind on the finish.
The aromas are surprisingly light considering the variety, with whiffs of both lime and peach. It drinks dry, with the variety difficult to discern.
The blend in this wine is as whimsical as the name, with Tempranillo and Grenache alongside Portugal's Tinta Cão and Souzão grapes. The result is an aggressive, powerful wine with a broad palette of aromas and flavors, ranging from vanilla, forest floor and animal sweat to cigar, flint, blackberry jam and coffee. Big, bold tannins. Better after 2011.
Opens with rustic, red-fruit and herbal aromas along with smooth leather. The palate is creamy and full, but healthy despite mild buttery oak notes. Flavorwise, we're talking chunky berry and fresh tomato, while the finish is long and correct, with a hint of leftover tomato.
Taut and tense, this opens with aromas of red berry, crushed herb, clove and whiff of menthol. The firm, tightly wound palate offers bright cherry, licorice and ground black pepper alongside assertive tannins and nervous acidity. Give this time to unwind and fully develop. Drink 2019–2031.
Ripe red-cherry and blossom aromas are accented with char and toast on this aromatic, spirited Cabernet Franc. The palate is brisk, with fresh black-cherry and plum flavors wrapped in fine-grained tannins and a savory herbal edge.
Yes, that is the correct price. This Applegate Valley Zin might be considered the Turley of Oregon. The bottle alone must weigh several pounds. Concentrated raspberry and boysenberry fruit retains enough acid to keep it from becoming syrupy. The  supremely oaky flavors carry streaks of Kahlua and dark chocolate. But the density that might balance the 16.5% percent alcohol just isn't there.
Rustic, leathery aromas of brandied cherry, red currant and resiny oak set up a full, round palate. This Monastrell tastes earthy and a bit flat, with mild spice notes accenting core prune flavors. A beefy, loamy, thick finish brings herbal notes.
Not drinkable now or anytime soon, due to the tannins. Scours the mouth with a hard astringency, like the Cabernets of a generation or two ago. There are rich, ripe flavors of blackberries and currants swimming below those depths, as well as lots of sweet, smoky oak. But you'd need a crystal ball to know what this Bordeaux blend will do in 10 or 15 years.
There's a slightly charry, roasted or asphalt top note to this wine's aromas, but the wine's flavors are an intriguing mix of cola, rhubarb and red berries, ending with mouthwatering raspberries coming to the fore. It's a full-bodied, creamy-textured wine that should be enjoyed over the next few years.
Classic scents of dark-skinned berry, chopped herb, dark spice and new leather take the lead in this wine. On the firm elegant palate, youthfully assertive, noble tannins support dried Marasca cherry, licorice and clove flavors while bright acidity lends balance.
This is a lovely white made by Chris Dearden. Whole-cluster pressed and fermented in once-used French oak, the grapes are sourced from a 12-acre parcel planted to Old Wente clone Chardonnay. Dark golden in hue, it has graceful acidity and a burst of lemon blossom on the nose that evolves into a sublime lightness and crispness on the palate.
This wine's strawberry and raspberry flavors carry a slightly funky bouquet, but call it a feature, not a flaw. It has salted caramel notes from aging for nine months in 30% new French oak, and it's creamy and focused on the palate, finishing on a hint of cola.

A rugged Cabernet Sauvignon for everyday drinking, this is dry and smoothly tannic, and it deals blackberry jam, sage and cedar flavors.
A bit lean, although it's very clean and elegant. Marked by acidity, and with a silky texture, it shows flavors of cherries, raspberries, cola, herbs, golden tobacco and sandalwood. Drink now.
Adastra is an organically farmed vineyard and the wine shows an earthy profile that's substantial and defining. Full bodied and ripe, it rides a tension of acidity that provides freshness, seasoned in tart cherry and pomegranate.
Domaine Houchart is one of the top estates in Sainte-Victoire. This ripe while deliciously fruity and fresh wine is full of raspberries, ripe red currants and a refreshing line of acidity.
A touch stewy, with molasses and sherry aromas on top of earthy fruit. Flavors of pie cherry and cranberry are more austere than the bouquet might indicate, yet that tight, starchy fruit will do well washing down pizza or rigatoni alla vodka.
This is pure Cabernet that was sourced from four vineyards, with vines averaging 31 years. True noninterventionist winemaking is in play to make this chewy, tight and dark effort.This is grainy and dense, with notes of cassis, coffee and cacao.

Blackberry and blueberry jam and sweet oak flavors mark this young Syrah. It's dry, tannic and juicy, but a little soft in acidity. Drink it now and over the next few years.
There's nothing elegant about this Cabernet, but it does score high on the deliciousness scale. Shows Dry Creek's rustic tannin structure, with a scoury mouthfeel, but the blackberry, blueberry and currant flavors, which are accented with smoky oak, are incredible. Drink it over the next few years, and watch it change as it breathes in the glass.
With plenty of weight, but weight that is concentrated around a tight, firm tannic core. The wine has great ripe plum and black cherry fruits, brimming from the glass. The acidity is a strong presence, and with the tannin promises several years' aging.
A small percentage of Petit Verdot was added to this Cab, the grapes sourced from throughout the Napa Valley. Cedar, mint and chocolate cassis come foreward on the palate, the wine slightly thin though oaky.
Spicy-sweet notes of dried orange peel and mango waft from this aromatic late-harvest wine. Lip-smacking marmalade sweetness is countered by a piercing strike of lemon acidity. Juicy and quaffable, it would be a lovely accompaniment to spicy Asian cuisine or a cheese plate.
Opens with spicy, almost smoky dark fruit aromas, which are followed by a healthy palate with freshness, good berry flavors and a touch of creamy oak that leans toward vanilla and lacticity. Good all around, with depth and a solid mouthfeel. Nice wine for the price.

The winery's larger production offering, this is made from a handful of vineyards, including many used in vineyard-designates. Blending prowess shows in this wine that explodes in plum and clove. Tight, bright acid buoys flavors of strawberry, cranberry and orange, with a twisted funk of earth on the finish.
Soft and simple and as sweet as something you'd pour over ice cream. The flavors are terrifically ripe—cherries, raspberries, dates, vanilla fudge, butterscotch. And look at that alcohol, 16.6%!
Easy-drinking, this vibrantly crisp wine shines with well-etched lemon and grapefruit flavors and a grassy-herbal edge. Great acidity makes it clean and tart. Well made, it's a pleasant sipper and would be good with shellfish. —S.H.

Enticing scents of pressed rose, wild berry, scorched soil, leather and menthol take shape in the glass. The juicy, savory palate doles out red cherry, crushed raspberry, licorice, baking spice and grilled herb alongside ripe, velvety tannins. It's already approachable and will drink well for several more years. Drink through 2022.

A tremendous wine that easily merits being Barnett's most expensive release. Shows the ripe blackberry and black currant flavors and new oak that are so easily achieved, with yet near perfect tannins and a dryness unusual in a Cabernet this fruity. The combination of opposites makes this mountain wine noteworthy, as well as ageable. Now–2017.
This elaborate wine totally satisfies for its rich, creamy texture and forward pineapple custard, kiwi, honeydew and tangerine flavors. As if that weren't enough, toasty new oak carries it over the finish line. Dry and balanced, lots of quality here for the price.
From the rocky Stagecoach Vineyard atop Atlas Peak, this Cabernet is hearty in tannins and built to age through 2020, the dense black berry and cherry fruit flavors needing time to mature. For now, the wine's character is all savory and leathery, with tight tannins.
Sweet and simple, with candied orange, pear and pineapple flavors, wrapped into a syrupy-soft texture.
Heavy, tannic and dense now, but clearly well-grown, this Bordeaux blend wants a little time in the cellar to knit together.

It's fantastically rich, a wine of deliriously decadent flavors, ranging from blackberry jam and crème de cassis to mocha, blueberry extract and buttered cinnamon toast. Yes, it's soft, but it's the softness of fine velvet. After all that richness, the finish is amazingly dry. Drink over the next few years to enjoy its youthful beauty.

There have been 19 (dix-neuf) generations of Mellots making wine in Sancerre; at least one of them in each generation has been named Alphonse.

Drink this very fine wine now, although, like the Mellots, it will also age.

The nose spells delicacy and the palate proves it: this is a light-footed filigree and yet has a firm, straight backbone of spice and zest. Its midpalate texture slowly grows on you and draws you in with mossy notes of pear and ivy.
Toastier and smokier than the other bottlings, with clove and coffee accents dressing up sturdy plum and earth flavors. Finishes long, with hints of tart plum skin and dusty tannins. Seems as if rare duck breast would be a perfect match.
A bit grassy and green on the nose, probably due to the Carmenère portion in the blend. The palate is narrow but firm, with tight tannins creating some roughness. Flavors of red fruits and green herbs conflict a bit, while the finish is of carob and red sucking candy. Good but a little green.

Lemon blossom, apple and mineral aromas meet in a regular place. The palate is chunky and shows just enough acidity, and the flavors run towards generic citrus, apple and green melon. Falls off on the finish, so drink as soon as possible.
Kind of clunky now. Bigtime tannins make it astringent, and the fruit flavors, of blackberries and sour cherry candy coated with oak, feel ripely heavy on the palate. Yet it's a clean wine, and could surprise down the road. Try after 2012.
A very flavorful wine, rich in blackberry jam, chocolate, white mint and buttercream. The tannins on this Syrah, Grenache and Mourvedre blend are thick and soft.

This wine's dense complexity is immediately apparent in the nose; offering hints of Asian spice, cinnamon, cardamom, along with supple layers of purple and black fruits.

There is a balance point here—it has not reached too far; it's just right.

This is soft, young and fruity, with a dominating red-plum flavor. It makes for a fine apéritif, with its open, warm and ready-to-drink character.
This is a classic Napa Valley floor Cabernet, enhanced with handfuls of Petit Verdot and Merlot. Dusty in red currant and herb, it offers mellowed tannins and a peppery underbelly.
Disappointing considering the source. The nose reeks of chocolate mint, marshmallow and burnt leaves, while the palate is tannic, sour and shows only citrusy red fruit notes. One of Lurton's weakest wines to date.
As the name Sasyr suggests, this wine represents a successful blend of Sangiovese (60%) and Syrah that is sensual, spicy, savory and perfect for hearty meat dishes. This vintage shows great quality with ripe fruit tones, leather, tobacco, black olive and a plush, velvety mouthfeel.

Nice and dry, with firm, hard tannins and rich flavors of blackberries, cherries and dark chocolate. The oak is pretty strong, offering a coating of caramel. Shows a full-bodied, masculine Cabernet character that needs a good decant to aerate the tannins. Should age though 2013, at least.
Cedar, tobacco and berry aromas are more general than specific. The palate is on the heavy side, with grabby tannins. Flavors of roasted berry fruits and cocoa finish dense, steady and with depth. While this is a bit heavy and ripe, it speaks of Rioja in a positive way; drink through 2020.
This opens with aromas of toasted oak, yellow apple skin and a confectionery note. The aromas carry over to the firm palate along with butterscotch and a mineral note but it doesn't have quite enough fruit richness to stand up to the dominant oak sensations.
An intensely fresh wine, touched lightly by spritz that brings out the lemon character. The acidity lifts the whole wine deliciously.

Tight and bright, with sharp acidity, the Knight's Gambit bottling shows tangy raspberry fruit, juicy and primary. You might be tasting right out of the barrel; it's that young and fresh. Let it air out if you want to put some flesh on it.
A high-acid, weighty and complex white, this vintage is even better than the last, gorgeous in a golden tannish color. Tropical guava and white flowers weave seamlessly through a web of minerality and freshness, without compromising body and texture. This is a delicious wine.
Initially shy on the nose, this eventually opens up in the glass to reveal dried yellow fruit, toast, chamomile flower and a whiff of sage. The palate offers toasted oak, walnut and a buttery note, but it lacks fruit richness.

This wine's distinct and intriguing nose pairs cola and cinnamon with cranberry, chopped chaparral scrub and wildfire smoke. That scrubby character of green sage and mugwort extends to the palate, spicing up the beet juice, ripe raspberries and a pencil-lead backbone.
Its red fruit-driven nose gives way to a significantly earthy palate, which also shows dried mushrooms and exotic spices.

Rich and almost liquorous in its texture, this is powerful stuff. It has weight, with intense, concentrated flavors of tropical fruit, spice and a smooth character. The acidity lends lift on the finish. Screwcap.

The nose is white pepper, sweet plums and rich blackberries, while the relatively light palate is all pepper and verve, with darker hints of leather, tobacco and espresso. It's a great food wine.
This has an edge, a frame of herb and skin flavors that tightens the mouthfeel. Green pineapple, cilantro, cucumber and lemon verbena are in play, with a penetrating attack and a pleasantly soft finish. The wine has a density that somehow recalls extra-virgin olive oil.
Aromas of game, medicine cabinet, Band-Aid and herb are followed by creamy-feeling fruit and barrel flavors. Game notes linger on the finish.
Lots of charred oak and leathery fruit start it out, and then you get runaway berry flavors and screechy, almost grabby tannins. It finally settles and smooths out with airing, but requires too much compromise on the part of the drinker. Has its good points but not enough of them.
This is a very pretty Amarone that shows medium intensity in terms of aromas and elegant tones of ripe fruit and spice. There's a slight tannic bite on the close and the wine spreads long and consistently over the palate.
Hard and mossy, and not bearing much resemblance to Cabernet as we know it. This wine has thickness and a creamy definition, but also lean fruit flavors that hint at raspberry and cranberry.

Strong veins of licorice, vanilla and tobacco run through this wine. Light plummy fruit, supporting acids and smooth tannins roll into a finish with more heat than the listed alcohol suggests.
The second vintage of this declassified barrel wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot, Merlot and Syrah. It provides aromas of blackberry, pencil eraser, coffee, strawberry and herbs. The palate boasts plump, flavorful fruit and savory notes before a lingering finish.
Rich, ruddy peach and tangerine scents are fleshy and ripe on this lavishly fruit-forward Riesling. Semi-sweet in style, it's unctuously juicy, but a jolt of grapefruit acidity adds balance and vibe. The finish is marked with a spray of citrus blossom.
From the winery's most pebbly five-acre section of vineyard atop Diamond Mountain, this is dark black-purple in color. The tannins are soft but powerful, eager to age through 2025–2027, while the fruit lies on the currant and plum side of things, with a bit of cedar lurking through.
This is a tasty Chardonnay, showing lots of pear, orange, mango, vanilla-cream and butterscotch flavors. It tastes on the sweeter side.
The use of 100% Syrah gives a deep pink color that borders on purple. Aromas are rather strong too, with the flaky, buttered crust of a hot cherry pie running into the more bitter elements of citrus rinds. Those characters play leading roles on the palate as well, cherry candy toying with just-ripe grapefruit, providing tensions that keeps the sipping interesting. Just 72 cases produced.
Earthy, leathery aromas are herbal and loaded with creamy oak. This feels solid but lacks complexity, while herbal, salty black-fruit flavors end short, with an herbal reprise and a hint of licorice on the finish.
Tight and oaky at first, with aromas of lemon rind, maple and leather. Next up, cassis and black cherry appear in the mouth, which precedes a tight, chocolaty finish that features good length and manly tannins. Very tightly wound, and powerful.
A firm wine, with dark chocolate and coffee flavors. The fruit flavors are  dark fig and stewed plums; there is a bitter edge to the tannins.
This is one of the most popular Chablis premier crus, and this soft wine shows why. It hints at minerality, but the main flavors are a great burst of apple and citrus. It has just the right vivid green character, the vanilla from the wood a very subtle afterthought.
The reserve is still tightly wound, but expressive, with firm, focused flavors of cassis fruit, backed with a refreshing minerality. Chewy and stylish, its briary fruits carry through a long, sculpted finish with light accents of herb.
This straightforward wine opens with aromas that recall underbrush, white mushroom, dark berries and blue flower. The one-dimensional palate is a bit shy on freshness but offers ripe black cherry with hints of white pepper and espresso alongside tightly-knit tannins.
This is definitely herbaceous, with gooseberry and citrus flavors and a crisp, cool feel. It dances lightly on the palate with vibrant acidity.
The winery's first varietal Merlot is a blend of fruit from the Canoe Ridge, Stone Tree and Cold Creek vineyards. The aromas are locked up at present with notes of dark fruit, crushed flowers and spice that lead to ripe, plush fruit flavors backed by a firm spine of tannins that need time to unwind. It's the most unabashedly forward wine this winery has made to date. Give it plenty of time to open up; it delivers.
Grapes come from heritage selection off the Osgood farm, and the wine shows licorice-berry-chocolate syrup aromas, as well as espresso with condensed milk and pipe smoke. The tannins coat the mouth and tickle the tongue in a pleasant way, offering rich plum fruit, graphite minerality and lifting mint, all balanced with strong acidity.
Grassy, reedy aromas accent core plum and berry scents. This feels tight and juicy on the palate, with a mix of raspberry, plum, savory spice and chocolate flavors. The finish is varietally typical, with herb, mint and olive notes.
A ripe, soft wine that is packed with strawberry fruits. It is smooth with a creamy caramel texture that contrasts with the fruity acidity and crisp aftertaste. Drink now.
Preserved cherries, cedar and smoke aromas lead the nose on this wine from the exciting Caliza team. The well-rounded flavors combine blackberry and cherry with tar and charred meats, and the strong tannins should calm down by 2016 and make for an even more delicious wine.
Herbal, peppery, tannic and slightly green, but very flavorful and interesting. Green coffee bean flavors are pure varietal; the tannins are tight and compact, with penetrating flavors. The fruit is dark, dense and very compact; the herbal flavors are there, but so is the ripeness, the smoke, the roasted earth and the chocolate.
Made entirely with Sangiovese, this hearty red opens with aromas of ripe berry and toasted oak. The dense solid palate delivers black cherry, French oak and white pepper alongside chewy tannins but the heat of evident alcohol dominates the finish.
If what you're looking for is a medium-weight red wine with bright fruit and bounce, this is it. It's not complex or weighty stuff; instead it's focused on jumpy cherry and raspberry flavors and a snappy feel. Totally pedestrian but good in its price category.
This is both fruity and deliciously crisp. It has the light touch of the vintage—red fruits attractively balancing with the acidity and the tangy lemon edge. The aftertaste is both fruity and herbal. Drink now.
This single-vineyard expression opens with enormous purity and intensity. The aromas recall blackberry, spice, leather, tobacco and Spanish cedar. The finish is rich, well structured and longlasting.
Waxy plum is given ample richness from a taste of milk chocolate in this luxuriously full-bodied voluptuous wine. Big lush tannins are met by a smoky backdrop of robust oak and a spicy hit of clove on the finish.
Apple-y on the nose and palate, with just a hint of dust and green leaves, this blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Feteasca Alba is refreshing, with striking acidity. Dry and medium bodied in style.
Classic Santa Lucia Pinot Noir, big, bold and delicious. What it lacks in delicacy it more than makes up for in ripe, jammy fruit. Raspberries and cherries star, with pretty notes of vanilla and toast from oak barrel aging. Drink now, but decant it for an hour or two.
Though it's 100% Merlot from Red Mountain, this seems more generic than representative of what that AVA can produce. It could be any modestly priced Bordeaux red variety or blend—red fruits, stiff tannins, and a seamless, yet one-dimensional mouthfeel.
This is the best Cab from Two Vines to date. It's got real concentration and fruit flavor, enhanced with the addition of 11% Cab Franc and 7% Syrah in the blend. Berries, cherries, cassis, plums, coffee and smoke filter through the palate, with just a little bite to the tannins. Very impressive.
Violet-red in color, this semisweet wine has a nose of blackberry and vanilla. It is soft on entry, with flavors of black cherry, blueberry and creme brûlée. It is smooth on the palate, while the blueberry pie finish is brightened up by a brief but not unwelcome tart note.
Rather heavy and soft and overtly sweet, but delicious, with a swirl of pineapple, Meyer lemon, apricot, peach, vanilla, cinnamon, white chocolate and honey flavors. Nice as a cocktail sipper, and maybe with spicy Vietnamese or Thai food.
There is a significant change in the flavors of this wine following the outstanding 2009 version. Case production has almost doubled, but the light aromas and flavors seem heavily scented with black pepper, with additional herb and cherry flavors on the finish.
A real success, Maryhill's exceptional cab franc shows dark, black fruits laced with licorice and streaks of tarry tannin. Structured and supple, dense and just hinting at decadence.
Hard cherry and nail polish aromas rise up from the glass. The palate is high in acid and clampy, with tart, leafy, rubbery berry fruit flavors. Dry and reasonably fresh on the finish.
Spelled with a backward “P,” Pipoli delivers dark fruit nuances of blackberry and prune, with light touches of cherry soda and raspberry at the back. There's a subtle impression of sweetness that helps soften the grape's tight tannins.
This wine starts off with a nose of fresh grass and subtle rosewater. These translate well on the palate, alongside additional hints of ginger and lemon. Tingling with acidity but thin in weight, the midpalate is slightly disjointed. A zing of citrus on the finish brings a bit of focus.
Plums, dusty earth and dried spice mingle on the nose of this older release that actually seems more ageworthy than Portal's 1997 and 1999. It's supple, medium-weight wine, with plum, prune and spice flavors that finish with modest tannins and pleasing berry and spice notes.
Cedar, savory balsamic, blueberry and cherry lead on this vibrant red blend from Bilton. Lots of spice, crushed herbs and berry on the palate. A touch of chocolate in the finish adds depth.
Black plums and Mission figs stewed with cinnamon, cloves and vanilla make for an intriguing nose on this bottling from a longtime Italian winemaking family. The palate shows cola, black cherry, coffee bean and dark chocolate, though proves quite grippy with a structure that will let down its guard with patience.
Delicate but pretty aromas of violet, dark berry, brown spice and a whiff of sun-baked earth emerge in the glass. The firm, forward palate doles out ripe black cherry, licorice, mint, clove and tobacco alongside tightly knit but refined tannins.
A blend of Merlot (58%), Syrah (35%), Petite Sirah (5%) and Primitivo, this hedonistic wine offers appealing suggestions of coffee, vanilla and cherry. Ripe, silky soft milk chocolate flavors finish warm.
The hot climate in which the grapes were grown shows in this wine's extreme softness and jammy ripeness. It's almost sweet, like a cherry and raspberry pastry.
A juicy wine, rich, ripe and sweet in jammy fruit and caramelized oak flavors. Black raspberries, blackberries and mocha, spiced with cinnamon and pepper, flood the mouth, wrapped into beautifully sculpted, sweet tannins. A lovely wine to drink now. The wine is mainly Syrah, with 5% Cabernet Sauvignon.
Pleasant and tasty, this has the raspberry, lime, dough and smoke flavors typical of a fine California sparkling wine. It's a little scoury, especially by the standards of Iron Horse, with a sand­papery roughness to its bubbles. Drink it now, well chilled.
Classic Russian River Pinot, made in a drink-me-now style. Light in body, it's fully dry, with a silky texture framing cherry, cola, pomegranate and sautéed Portobello mushrooms with a splash of balsamic. A hint of oaky toast adds complexity.
This Cabernet is enormously extracted in blackberries and cassis, and oaky, too, while the tannins are rich, hard and refined. It's a flashy wine. Drink now–2018.
This blend of Zweigelt, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot seems well suited to the Thermenregion, south of Vienna. This is a rich, perfumed wine, with juicy berry fruits and spice. There is a balanced wood element, giving richness and extra roundness. Age for 3–4 years.
Interesting fruit flavors of grapefruit, orange and citrus lead the way, bolstered by lots of bubbles and firm acids. There's a fair amount of sweetness as well, nicely balanced against the powerful, bracing fruit. This wine is probably best served at the end of a meal, with a light dessert of fresh fruit.
This wine includes Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and (somewhat unusually) Malbec. It's floral on the nose, with additional aromas of baking spices and blueberries. Full bodied, intense and relatively tannic, it finishes firm and dusty. Drink 2018–2030.
Made entirely with native Gaglioppo grapes, this vibrant rosato offers a delicate fragrance of white rose and red berry with a light anise note. The savory, refreshing palate delivers red raspberry, morello cherry, orange zest and white pepper brightened by tangy acidity. It's so fresh and easy drinking, you may need two bottles.
A lively, impressively fresh Aligoté, packed with green and citrus fruits, bubbling with bright vivacity.
The 2003, though still just 13% alcohol, seems to have more stiffness to the structure, more tannin and more density than the 2002. It's harder, chewier, less open and more challenging. It may also age more slowly. Right now there is a certain stemminess and bitterness to the tannins that keeps the fruit at bay, though the aromas seem to promise more. It may profit from an hour or two of breathing.
Situated on the plateau of Saint-Emilion, just east of the city, Château le Prieuré has produced a finely structured 2007, not big, but well balanced. Touches of cocoa and cinnamon spice cap the solid fruit and dry tannins. Age for 3–4 years.
A wonderfully refined wine, with firm, ripe tannins that fream an elegant blend of rich plum, balckberry, coffee, chocolate, cassis, black cherry, cedar and spice flavors. The finish is long and smooth, with a bright cherry boost at the end. Francis Coppola's benchmark wine.
This warm-climate wine is fulsome and hearty in baked Asian pear and candied ginger. A dried-fruit quality stands out on the buxom palate, a buttery taste of dried apricot drizzled in honey and brioche.
The fruit is from the Eola Hills, and it has an interesting bloody character, like raw meat. It's a more Burgundian style than most Sineanns, and riper than most Eola Hills fruit. It hints at earth, leather and marrow, with pretty, plummy fruit laced with cinnamon. An elegant, yet distinctive wine.
Nearly equal amounts of Cabernet and Shiraz are rounded out by a touch (8%) of Merlot in this soft, round, mouthfilling red. It offers plenty of sweetly ripe fruit with an herbal, medicinal edge.
This shows vanilla, clove, barrel spice and dark fruit aromas. Its fruit flavors are full and laced with upfront barrel notes. It seems a little boozy.
Juicy in tutti-frutti blackberries, cherries, plums, raspberries and milk chocolate, this soft, smooth Zin is also very peppery. It's a somewhat rustic wine to wash down with barbecue.
A smooth, wood-aged wine that shows concentrated fruit, a mineral edge of tannins. It is dense, with the structure dominant, giving some aging potential. Toast and black plum skin join acidity on the finish.
This négociant based in the Northern Rhône has turned out a meaty, savory Châteauneuf-du-Pape. It's full bodied and firmly structured, with plenty of clove, leather and peppered beef. Drink 2014–2020.
Rather dull, soapy wine, its fruit missing the right crispness. There are flavors of pear, yellow fruits, just not enough acidity.
Vivid, bright red cherry and cranberry notes create the main aroma and flavor impressions, while crisp acidity and lip-smacking tannins make a firm texture. On subsequent sips, more complexity and depth come out as the crisp, austere structure holds its ground. This is tantalizing, and should improve through 2019.
This rich, structured wine is packed with both firm tannins and rich red fruits. Still young, it has all the makings of a dense, balanced wine that will reflect the great fruit of the vintage. Age this smoky, full-bodied wine and drink from 2017.
This is a soft, simple Chardonnay, sugary sweet in vanilla, caramel, peach and pineapple jam and spice flavors. A good coat of acidity provides needed balance.
With some blackberry, cassis and oak flavors, this is a pretty good wine. It's a little green, and the acidity is sharp. Drink up.
From the St. Peter of Alcantara Vineyard in the Templeton Gap area, this blend of 62% Petite Sirah, 19% Grenache, 13% Syrah and 6% Zinfandel shows blueberry, boysenberry, slate minerality, uncracked peppercorns and a wild mint/woody shrub character on the nose. The palate offers dried black cherry and blueberry, tobacco, black loam, dried herbs and pencil lead.
Heady aromas of citrus and orchard fruit almost jump out of the glass. The savory, medium-bodied palate tastes of ripe pear, mature apple and creamy peach interspersed with energizing mineral notes. Fresh acidity brightens the creamy flavors.
Here's a bold, ripe offering that delivers savory blackberry and black cherry flavors, with layers of white and black pepper. The brawny, tightly-knit tannins are balanced by vibrant acidity, giving this an ageworthy structure. Drink 2019–2029.
This wine smells and tastes overripe and oaky. It starts out with the aroma of raisins, and then tastes like caramel, chocolate and blackberry jam. The finish is hot and porty. Still, it does define this big, baked style of Zinfandel.
The aim here is an unoaked, brisk white wine, and that's exactly what this is. Don't look for nuance. It's an easy sipper that's citrusy and spicy, the kind of wine to toss back with cioppino, broiled halibut or just a simple salad.
The third vintage of this wine is 100% varietal, with the fruit coming from Stone Tree, Cold Creek and Beverly vineyards. Aromas of coffee, vanilla, clove, dark plum and spice lead to concentrated, layered but still elegant fruit flavors.
This is a creamy and layered wine (made with the Grecanico variety) that offers pretty aromas of banana nut, exotic fruit, chestnut honey and mature notes of melon and stone fruit. The wine is naturally rich with generous flavors and good length.
Winemaker Matthias Pippig brings Syrah to a whole new level with this stunningly dramatic bottling. Don't worry about the California appellation, a peculiarity of the winery's ownership. It's made entirely from Santa Barbara grapes, namely from Watch Hill in Los Alamos and Bien Nacido in Santa Maria Valley. The intensity of fruit defies description. It suggests enormous blackberry and creamy-sweet chocolate, larded with bacon and sprinkled with black pepper—and that doesn't even begin to describe the toasty sweetness of the 100% new oak barrels. This is the best California Syrah of the vintage, and one of the greatest Syrahs the state has ever produced. This opulence comes at a cost, however: The alcohol is high.
This wine is a success for the vintage with its ripe Cabernet flavors and dark, dense tannins. It is fruity certainly, with a juicy, perfumed background. However, the structure and texture show best—firm and dry, indicating a good potential. This concentrated wine will not be ready to drink before 2024.
Limarí is proving itself to be the right region for floral, cool-climate Syrah. This one from Tamaya is minerally and flowery smelling, with bright flavors of black cherry, plum and boysenberry. It's structured and zesty, with good tannic grip and a full finish of kirsch, pepper and coffee. Not outrageous but still one of the best wines we've tried from this producer. Imported by Ecovalley Quality Wine Group and National Refrescos Import Company, LLC.
Dense, yes, but this is also a handsome wine that balances complex tannins with pure black currant fruits that shine. This biodynamic wine has a generous, full and rich feel, ripe with just a touch of restraint. The greatness of the wine shows in its purity with a deceptive simplicity that hides the final complex tannins and structure.
Featuring the Wädenswil clone, this block selection carries a whiff of wintergreen and lavender. That minty lift elevates the palate's pretty cherry fruit. It's a harmonious wine, with perfectly proportioned acids and a faint truffle note as it fades gracefully.
Green plum, mowed lawn, pungent green apple skins and a touch of candied peach ripeness make for a classic Sauv Blanc nose on this bottling from one of the region's oldest producers. The palate is zippy with persistent and penetrating acidity, showing tight green apple and well as riper pineapple flavors, with a flash of vanilla toward the finish.
This is a tight, structured and stalky wine. Smoky black-currant flavors are freshened by acidity in the 79% Merlot and 21% Cabernet Sauvignon blend from 15 acres. A firm character keeps the wine tough. Drink from 2016. A member of Alliance Bourg.
A wonderfully drinkable beerenauslese, which makes it a serious accomplishment—sometimes these wines can just be too much. This one balances its intense dried apricot and golden raisin notes with tropical and citrus fruit and lively acidity.
Dark, concentrated, mildly charred aromas of black plum and blackberry are toasty, strong and minerally. Following the nose, this Malbec is chewy, extracted and fairly rich. Blackberry is the lead fruit flavor, backed up by a lot of oak and vanilla.
This wine delivers plenty of honey and peach notes upfront, then closes with lime and mineral notes from the tiny proportion of Eden Valley Riesling that's been blended in. Crisp and steely.
Soft, and rich with glycerine and alcohol, this Zin is almost a Port wine on the palate. Drunk on its own, it's simple and awkward, but paté is kind to it.
This comes from Quinta do Portal, well known for its Douro table wines. It is a fine, concentrated Port which shows tannins, fresh fruit and flavors of cherries. It is spoilt by the stalky aromas, but the taste is good compensation.
This fragrant, light-bodied and savory Sicilian red opens with intense aromas of blue flower, rose and red berries. The bright, silky palate delivers juicy strawberry, crushed red cherry and white pepper alongside fresh acidity. Chill this for 20 minutes and sip on the deck for a perfect summer red.
Vines that are more than 50 years old are the backbone of this wine. It is called Epicurean, meaning it is made to go with food and its extra dryness, almost extra brut, puts it firmly in that category. Structured and tangy, the wine could do with some more bottle age, so drink from 2017.
A fully ripe wine, that has black-currant and blueberry fruit, fine acidity and balanced tannins. It is juicy, fruity although with a good structure that will allow it to age longer. Drink from 2017.
While this wine comes out of the chute loaded with toast, mocha and brown sugar-inflected oak, the wood falls appropriately into the background on the palate, allowing cassis fruit to come forward. It's firm and tannic, with a powerful structure that requires a few years to come into perfect balance; try it after 2020.
Not showing very well and smelling like sweet soda. Spring for Klinker Brick's 2008 Old Ghost instead, a much more stellar version of Lodi old-vine Zin, double the price but worth every additional dollar.
This is an attractive, ripe, spicy and fruity wine. Its acidity is just right, producing a clean balance in its rich, full Gewürztraminer character. This is delicious to drink now, even better in a year.
This sparkling wine, a blend of 60% Chardonnay and 40% Pinot Noir, is dry, creamy and rich in flavors of citrus, yeast and vanilla. It feels refined and silky on the palate, with a honeyed finish.
Mostly Cabernet Sauvignon (94%) along with Malbec and Petit Verdot, it has the flavor of a Mounds bar with sweet notes of chocolate and coconut along with dark cherry, herbs, and moist soil. It's rich and full bodied with tannins adding a gritty mouthfeel.
Sugary sweet and cloying in raspberry jelly flavor. More of a simple dessert wine than a rosé.
For a first effort with rosé, Los Vascos has done a good job capturing fresh raspberry and cherry aromas along with punchbowl flavors of berry skins, watermelon and red apple. The finish has grip and acidic balance, while the overall package is quite positive, especially for Chile. Cab Sauvignon, Syrah and Malbec.
A lush, rich  Port with a smooth texture and flavors that range from black cherry, blackberry, cassis, cinnamon, anise, chocolate, toffee, butterscotch and thyme. It's complex yet delightfully easy to drink.
This six-year-old blend of 46% Syrah, 32% Cabernet Sauvignon and 22% Merlot is showing its age, with aromas of reduced cherry sauce, tar and cocoa dust. The rustic palate is full of leather, tobacco, dried cherries and dusty earth flavors. Still interesting, but drink up soon.
Tight-grained oak, vanilla, graphite, plum and cassis aromas are attractive as a whole. This feels good but a bit tartaric and scratchy. Ripe black-fruit flavors are pure Peumo, while touches of licorice and chocolate add to the fun. A saturated finish tastes of blackberry, black currant and peppery spice. Drink through 2022.
Quite light, in both mouthfeel and flavor, this has simple, rather generic fruit and a bit of butter.
Hailing from Canyon Vineyard Ranch, this wine has aromas of milk chocolate, herbs, spice and leather. It's restrained in style, with citrusy acids, abundant vanilla and cocoa flavors, with firm, lightly dry tannins.
This is done in a style that walks the line between Kabinett and Spatlese; it's just 11% alcohol but the fruit sweetness is largely hidden behind the tangy natural acids. It's got the mixed fruit flavors of peach, apricot, citrus and even a hint of tropical, along with the edgy definition of citrus peel that gives it a crisp finish.
Aromas of toasted nut, smoke, dried wild flower and mature orchard fruit lead the nose. The medium-bodied, rather evolved palate shows notes of honey, yellow apple skin and a hint of hazelnut. Drink soon to capture the remaining freshness.
Rugged and aggressive, but that's just fine considering how big, broad and tannic this Carignan is. Look for fiery licorice aromas with notes of citrus peel and black cherry. The palate offers tons of weight, richness and spice.
90-92. Barrel sample. This is a big, ripe and fruity wine that's packed with flavors of spice and blackberry. It needs to age for its dry core of dense tannins to soften.
This wine tastes like a superripe, late-harvest and lavishly oaked version, so that all the aromas and flavors seem to be in overdrive. It smells like cinnamon and vanilla, tastes like strawberry jam, and has a little white pepper in the finish.
This underrated village, which is located next to Savigny-lès-Beaune, has produced an attractive, fruity wine that has a fine structure, a red berry flavor and a twist of acidity on the finish. Keep this for 2–3 years.
Violet, black cherry and berry aromas are elevated by mocha and coffee aromas, while the palate is deep and layered. Flavors of boysenberry and plum are creamy and rewarding, and the finish offers plenty of fruit in addition to oak. Maybe not super complex, but the wine's bold meatiness makes up for that. 1,000 cases produced.
It's amazing how veteran winemakers like Adam Tolmach are able to extract such deep flavors from a wine and yet keep it fresh and light. This awesome bottling shows boisterous pomegranate, hibiscus, fig, crushed graphite, black pepper and dried tarragon on the ripely layered nose. The lush and soft palate buttons it up a bit, offering light licorice, minty cola, black cherry and vanilla dust.
Made as a barrel and block selection from the producer's own estate vineyard along River Road, this is an inaugural release. It impresses in spicy rose, black tea and geranium, supple in tannin and structure with a robust, full-bodied lushness on the palate that lingers.
This pale-hued blend of Grenache and Syrah starts off a bit confected, offering up scents of cotton candy. Yet it's less so on the palate, where the fruit resembles underripe melon and the finish is stony and less generous.
This is a rich, sweetly decadent Barbera that offers a richness seldom seen in the variety, although the tannins are thick and classic. With blackberry, leather, teriaki beef and spice flavors, it will be a good companion for smoky ribs.
Along with its richness and opulent sweetness, this wine also has a fresh orange-zest character. Balance the two aspects and the wine is a complex, bright and sweet wine that would go with fruit desserts as well as by itself. Beware: There is no sweetness indication on the label.
Under the management of Jean Merlaut, this estate has lost some of the super-opulence of the wines of the 90s, and gained finesse and elegance. That has stood the 2003 in good stead, emphasizing solidity and dry tannins to balance the wood and cranberry flavors of the fruit. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates.
This Cabernet-led blend has leafy, stalky, dried-out aromas of rubbery berry and compost. It feels raw and rubbery; leafy red-berry flavors are roasted and stalky. It finishes with a mixture of burnt and green flavors.
Try giving this Pinot Noir 5–6 years in the cellar. It's not that it's undrinkable now, but it's immature, offering just a hint of what it wants to be. The fruit is ripe and jammy, suggesting red cherries and pomegranates, and the acidity is juicy and tart. Pinots from this vineyard are known to age well.
Aromas of black plum and mocha prepare the palate for flavors of blackberry, cassis, pomegranate and thyme. Offering ample mouthfeel and full-fruit flavors amidst slightly grippy tannins, this wine wraps up in a lasting cherry finish.
Refreshing and straightforward, this presents delicate aromas suggesting exotic fruit and a whiff of spring blossom. The bright palate offers banana, green apple, juicy citrus and a light mineral note alongside fresh acidity.
Not the most successful Rosella's Pinot ever. The flavors are rich enough, suggesting raspberries, cherries and cola, and the wine is dry and silky. But there's an acidic sharpness, reminiscent of mint jelly, that deranges the palate.
Plenty going on here. The nose is more oblique than fruity, with herb, anise, vanilla bean and baked apple. Unexpectedly crisp and stony on the palate, with bright, full-force pineapple, yellow apple and stone fruits. Not heavy, and finishes clean. A lively, balanced wine. Excellent for the region.
This Reserve holdover from '05 is '0 well-oaked, so there are clear-cut coffee and mocha aromas to go with adequate fruit scents. But the forceful oak leaves a lemony, hammering flavor on top of simple cherry fruit. With some oil and shoe polish on the finish, this wine doesn't impress.
A hint of reduction obfuscates this wine's nose. With a little air, it begins to show some of its red plum and red cherry notes. The palate is smooth, fresh and generous with fruit. Make sure to let it breathe.
This wine is an unusual blend of Grenache (59%), Cabernet Sauvignon (29%) and Syrah. It brings aromas of herbs and red fruit that lead to a full-bodied palate, chock-full of plump, ripe cherry and raspberry flavors, with the tannins giving a squeeze. It's a unique interpretation of these three varieties.
This restaurant favorite struts its stuff in the nose, providing an ample blast of pungent grapefruit, passion fruit and mint. The palate is mildly grassy, with yet more grapefruit along with touches of flint and stone. The finish is clean and proper, with citrus flavors flowing on a stream of vital acidity.
Soft, fruity wine, a perfect foil for grilled meats with its light tannin structure. Ripe and very fruity, generous and juicy.
Grilled peach meets exotic yuzu citrus on the nose. Lively yet rich, the palate houses bright notes of white cherry alongside buttered popcorn. The lightly textured finish is reminiscent of supple white tea.
There's a very attractive ashen quality to this wine that sits like a veil over a base of stone fruit, honey and pear. The mineral notes come from Campania's rich volcanic soils and this Falanghina does a great job of portraying the variety.
The Shaw and Smith M3 Chardonnay continues to be a reliable performer, with the 2007 showing more restrained oak influence than in the past. It's still smoky and toasty upfront, but backed by ample apple and citrus fruit, and on the palate there's more of a toasted-grain note rather than overt vanilla and spice. Acids are crisp, elegantly extending the finish.
From the same vineyard that provides fruit for John Duval's Plexus, this is a blend of approximately 50% Grenache, 30% Shiraz and 20% Mourvèdre. There's a slightly lifted, vinyl quality to the aromas on first nosing, but once accustomed to it, it's no longer bothersome, leaving the way open for chocolate, cherry and cola flavors. Coffee and spice notes mark the supple finish. Drink now–2012.
Simple and watery, it has oaky flavors of citrus fruits and peaches. There's not much going on, but it is dry and crisp in acidity.
Out of balance and lacking freshness on the nose. Baked aromas and old leather scents don't impress, and the palate is saucy and heavy, with tomato paste, cooked plum and green herb flavors.
Earthy and perfumed berry aromas get this off to a good start. The palate is chewy and medium in size, with straightforward blackberry flavors backed by a blast of coffee. The finish dries out quickly, leaving a peppery aftertaste.
Crisp and tangy, this is a tightly knit wine. Apples and crisp citrus flavors are part of a package that also includes spice, a strong minerality and a perfumed aftertaste. The wine should age a few more months, so drink from 2017. This is a “village” wine in the northern Maçon area.
It's a shame quantities of this wine are so minuscule (20 cases imported), because it shows the enormous potential of the appellation and producer. Intense aromas of smoke, espresso and black olive lead to a palate that's full bodied and creamy in texture. There's some oak influence, but the notes of vanilla, cinnamon and clove are just an accent to the harmonious whole. Drink now–2020.
From a vineyard sited near the winery, this is the most supple, balanced and evenly detailed of the 2007 red wines from Fidélitas. The lightly muscled, compact fruit flavors bring black cherry, cassis, and plum together, with a strong minerality providing subtext. A suggestion of smoke suffuses the finish.
Dramatically rich and full-bodied in blackberry, cassis, dark chocolate and oak flavors. With thick, fine tannins giving it a youthful astringency, this Bordeaux blend needs to be cellared. Should develop bottle notes over the next ten years.
The price makes this a relative bargain for a cuvée sourced from 100-year-old vines within Le Crau, one of the appellation's most renowned lieux-dits. Notions of leather, cedar and cocoa accent bright red-plum fruit in this full-bodied wine, adding a hint of cracked pepper on the richly textured finish.
This pretty Pinot combines aromas of cherry and clove with fresh strawberry and cherry flavors, a lively texture and lingering finish. Refreshing and complete, it would pair well with everything from salmon to steak.
After a shaky start, Ortman is beginning to get its Syrah act together. It's not easy making a high-quality Syrah for this price, but this one manages to do it. Dry, soft and lush, it shows opulent blackberry, cherry, plum, coffee and chocolate flavors, with a spicy finish. Drink now.
Here's a pure expression of the Garganega grape that sees (in part) 8 months of oak aging for extra density and thickness. The wine shows spicy notes of cinnamon and white pepper backed by peach and candied fruit.
Another solid Chardonnay from Gloria, continuing a string of recent successes. At more than three years of age, the wine is holding nicely, with oak, buttered toast, pineapple, crême brulée and custard spice flavors, brightened with exceptionally brisk acidity.
Fresh creamy fruit gives this wine immediate appeal. It has tropical flavors, a light touch of green and fresh, crisp acidity. Great summer drinking.
Another Symington family brand that often shows well, Smith Woodhouse's 10-Year Oldis big and firm, quite tannic even, and very rich and dry. This is a good, solid, powerful wine, with great finishing acidity.
Smells young, fresh, and oaky, with flamboyant black-cherry fruit as well as roasted coffeebean and oriental spices. Very rich and extracted, with dry-cherry fruit and a creamy texture. It's a bit hard now with tannins, so give it a few years, or drink it sooner with duck or lamb.
Simple and light, with orange blossom aromas. The palate is clean, zesty and citric, with apple, lime and lychee flavors. Chalky on the finish and cleansing. For casual sipping.

Made in a very ripe, very oaky manner, this Chardonnay is extraordinarily rich now, if not very subtle. It's all about power. Buttered toast, caramel cream, pineapple marmalade, lime, orange and spice flavors flood the mouth, snapping to an oaky finish.
A well-balanced Champagne, its apple and citrus texture going well with the bottle-age toast. The wine has richness and bitter almond flavors with a crisp, dry aftertaste. It shows all the fine structure of the vintage.
The vines of Saint-Tropez are often within sight of the sea in the hills above the famous resort. This single-estate wine from a property managed by the Saint-Tropez cooperative contrasts fresh fruit and acidity with a generous ripe texture. It is soft, fruity and ready to drink now.
Seems sort of waxy and baked, with mildly acrid aromas of burnt corn leading the way. The palate has an o.k. feel but the flavors are rather bitter and burnt, and the fruit isn't pointed or expressive. May already be past its prime. Imported by Winery Exchange.
A blend of Sangiovese, Sagrantino, Merlot and Cabernet, this offers aromas of cherry-berry and dessert spices that carry over to the palate, along with a licorice note. It's ripe and round but also a bit tired, with a drying, tannic finish.
Intense aromas recall fragrant jasmine and honeysuckle alongside whiffs of exotic fruit. The round palate delivers juicy green apple, citrus and hints of yellow peach that end on a mineral note.

This Bordeaux-style blend showcases the intensity of the vineyard's grapes, with aromatics suggesting bright berries and iron filings. It's still a tight, compact wine, sharply acidic, and will require further bottle age to really deliver on its potential. Try after 2018.
There's a modern twist to this traditional wine of northern Italy that comes forward aromatically as spice, vanilla, leather and loads of black fruit. It shows fine texture and density and would make a good match to oven-roasted pasta.
While a bit restrained in style, this dry easy-going Riesling offers delicate shades of tangerine and yellow-apple flavor augmented by zesty lime and lemon acidity. Crisp texture and a soft bristle of lime zest lend a vibe to the finish.
Bright pomegranate and red cherry flavors penetrate this bracingly fresh Lemberger. The palate is primary and fruity, but nuanced by wisps of smoke, nuts and a lingering ruffle of tannins. It's an elegantly structured yet refreshing, quaffable wine.
A mix of 70% Sangiovese and other international red grapes, this would pair well with pizza or pasta with meat ragù. It shows flavors of cherry, forest berry, cola, almond and a touch of mild tobacco.
This almost pure Carmenère (there is a little Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend also) sneaks up on you. At first herbal and green, it fills in with a few hours of breathing time, lengthens and shows unsuspected complexity. Cranberry, a whiff of smoke, a bite of pepper, and fresh, not dried herbs, nicely blended into a seamless, satisfying whole.
An intriguing but offbeat wine, with some of the traditional character of Australian dry Riesling—austere, minerally aromatics and screeching acid levels—but also sweet flavors of peach and lime. Imported by Epic Wines.
Caramel and toast aromas lead to a wine where wood is, surprisingly for Sancerre, an important element. It has weight, a creamy texture, suggestions of mellow peaches, soft and ripe.
Very few producers make a varietally labeled offering of Sémillon in the state, with this one including 14% Sauvignon Blanc. It's a shame as the variety clearly succeeds here. The aromas bring notes of fig, almond butter and spice followed by dry fruit flavors backed by lemony acidity. It needs some time to fully come together.
This is a fat wine with light, juicy acidity. Honey and spice notes add interest to its broad melon and apple flavors.
Sweet and simple, this Chard tastes like peach, pineapple and pear juice with a couple spoons of white sugar.
In the hands of master blender Dirk Niepoort, even a straight tawny style has depth of flavor and intensity. The wine has red fruit, layered with concentrated acidity, a hint of wood aging, and remains fresh and fruity.
This is a gravel- and mineral-textured wine that has a very structured feel, with red berry flavors and firm tannins. Still young, it is a wine that should soften, so wait until 2016.
A blend of Tempranillo, Grenache and Syrah, this toasty, supple, seductive wine has a Zin-like focus of pure raspberry fruit. Elegant and stylish, with sculpted tannins and a hint of herb.
Generously oaked, with crème caramel and butterscotch from the barrels, this Chard also features very ripe underlying fruit flavors of golden mango and pineapple marmalade. It's fancy and generous, if a bit straightforward.
You can do better for the price. The wine is soft and hot, with peppery flavors of stewed fruits, but it offers plenty of rustic Zin personality.
Vegetal notes, mild citrus and sulfuric aromas make up the nose of this fresh but limited SB. Herbal, peppery green-fruit flavors are lean and finish with notes of rosemary and other green herbs.
Notes of ripe yellow apple play enticingly on the nose. They expand to full force on the palate and fill the mouth with their mellow goodness, supported in this by rich notes of shortbread and wonderful lemon freshness. The bubbles are creamy and disperse the lovely flavors to great effect. This is classy and delicious.
Medium intense aromas of tangerine citrus and crushed yellow flowers transition to flavors of dried grass, red apple and a touch of mushroom powder. Drink now.
Seemingly fully mature, this wine features lots of savory, meaty notes to go along with dried fruit aromas, then adds brighter, tart berry flavors on the palate. Vanilla, tobacco and crisp acids seem to be taking control of the finish, so drink up before the fruit fades.
The aroma shines with Syrah perfumes, while the palate brings together great ripe perfumed and spiced fruit, smooth, rich and dense. There is just an earthy element that needs to soften over the next two years.
This velvety red blend of 75% Syrah and 25% Grenache is dark and heady but approachable and easily drinkable now. Boysenberry and black cherry flood the bouquet, accented by notes of purple flowers and cola. Balanced and lush in the mouth, the black raspberry fruit and peppery spice carry through to the long, evolving finish.
Big and bold, this lives up to the reputation of richer Meursault. Yet crispness, a core of tight structure, toast and fresh fruits are always present. The play between the characters is delicious and likely to allow the wine to age over several years.
Strawberry and raspberry aromas are muddled by a burnt stalky character. In the mouth, it has good weight and flavors of fresh herbs, mint and slightly burnt, sulfuric cherry and raspberry. Shows a candied raspberry finish along with notes of herbs.
At the time of tasting, the nose of this dry white was still quite closed, but its buoyant, almost tropical, expressions of mango, cantaloupe and stone fruit on the palate were already quite irresistible. Penetrating and juicy, it wraps up elegantly with a zesty mineral finish. Drink through 2018 to enjoy its fresh, fruity style.
Made from estate fruit, this wine offers tart blueberry and plum flavors along with drying tannins. The nose displays some volatile aromas, which carry onto the palate. Depending upon your particular sensitivity, this may or may not enhance the experience.
This is a rich and smooth wine, creamy and full of baked apple and ripe pear flavors. Rounded with warm flavors, it carries just the right amount of citrus acidity and a touch of toast. Drink now until 2018.
Nice wine for this price. It's dry and full-bodied, and rich in plum, coffee and herb flavors. Very balanced. The sturdy tannins call for rich fare.
This vibrant, sunny wine opens with aromas of blue flower, red berry and a whiff of Mediterranean brush. The elegant palate delivers black cherry, crushed raspberry and hints of white pepper and herbs alongside firm, fine-grained tannins. Enjoy soon to capture the juicy fruit.
Lovely scents of violet and black fruit open this dark, sappy Syrah. The mouthfeel is sleek and citrusy, with sharp acidity and a finish amplified by barrel-influenced flavors of coffee and licorice. Give this some extra decanting time and it will open up further.
This is 100% Barbera, from the Milbrandt Northridge vineyard in the Wahluke Slope. Tight, tart, acidic and vanilla-streaked, it seems at once unripe and over-ripe. Barbera in Washington remains a bit of an experiment.
Produced by Jonathan Maltus, who also makes the superstar Saint-Emilion wine, Le Dôme, this is a beautifully crafted wine that brings together tropical fruits, flavors of quince and creamy vanilla. There is some good acidity, despite the hot year, which brings everything into balance.
This is a very pretty, polished wine for drinking now. It has rich, creamy flavors of tropical fruit and sweet, smoky oak that are brightened by crisp acidity.
Almost black in color, this wine shows persistent oak and green notes, accented with cedar, graphite and dust. The tannins are dry and woody, contributing to its food-friendliness.
Make room in the cellar for this heavyweight! Talk about a monster wine; but there's also finesse, character and style to it. Alabaster is the top wine from the Eguren family's new Toro winery, and it's big, tannic and loaded with spice, molasses and syrupy black fruit flavors. Rich, long and fierce on the finish, with tannins and heat to resolve. Best from 2012 through 2020.
This has a deep, dense red-black color and quite smoky aromas. Herbal, almost thick flavors resemble plum juice, black pepper and roasted mild chipotle chilies. Plenty of tannin adds grip to the texture. Despite the bold flavors, this is light in body.
Fruit aromas that recall citrus, nectarine, peach and tropical fruit carry over to the round palate. The juicy fruit flavors are supported by fresh acidity, giving this a clean finish.
This spritzy, sweet wine could serve well as a mixer for many hot weather punch drinks.

Floral scents float above a chunky, cherry-fruited, single-vineyard wine. It's quite refreshing, with appealing texture and underlying minerality that compensates for the overall impression of palate lightness. Drink now through 2018, while the freshness remains at its peak.
There's a lot of barrel influence in this acidic Viognier that finishes with a metallic taste.
Aromas of ripe berry, toast, chopped herb and coffee lead the way. On the palate, assertive, fine-grained tannins support raw red cherry, fresh raspberry, vanilla and aniseed.
Dusty mineral and herb tones lend complexity to the plush, sunny peach and apricot in this bristling semidry Riesling. It's juicy and plump yet revitalizing and fresh, marked by tangerine acidity and a lacy fringe of sugar that lingers on the finish. Drink now through 2025.
This is an inaugural release for the winery, established in 2013 where a former part of Buena Vista Winery stood. The grapes come from rocky Durell nearby, and take on its signature concentration and celebration of fruit. Golden in color, this is a ripe mingling of pear, baked apple and caramel that is entirely full bodied.
Soft and direct, this Pinot Noir offers easy flavors of cherries, currants, cola and spice, wrapped into a silky texture. Drink now.
This is a textured, steely wine with considerable acidity as much as fruit. Tight and with green apple and green plum characters, this structured wine has a salty, chalky texture. Tasting of the soil, it needs to age. Drink from 2018.
This is an inky black and impenetrable expression of Montepulciano from central Italy with dark spice aromas lavished over Maraschino cherry, blackberry and prune. Oak notes of spice, vanilla and black pepper fill in the background. The wine is firmly tannic on the close.
Open-knit aromas of apple, pear, green melon and mineral are perfectly good, while the palate is high in acid and kick. Flavors of grapefruit, generic citrus and grass are solid, as is the finish, which keeps its line. A snappy, alert, easygoing wine.
Ignore the silly name and focus on the important particulars—old vine (planted 1976), wild yeast, biodynamic farming. Absolutely bone-dry yet bursting with complex minerality, citrus rind, and penetrating acidity, it has phenolics that give length, breadth and detail.
Good Pinot character, but dry and unyielding. If you search for richness, you'll find a core of raspberries and cherries. Die-hard Burgundians will like the earthy, subtle complexities. Drink now.
Just an edge of butter gives this wine roundness and extra richness. Along with this character comes ripe peach fruit, lifted with acidity. Ready to drink. Screwcap.
A simple but pleasant Ribera red with berry-cherry aromas. The palate has a staunch, tannic grab to it as well as flavors of raspberry, black plum and earth. A wine that has o.k. length and solidity to the finish.
Vavsour's entry-level brand goes by the name of Dashwood, and offers a light, crisp introduction to NZ Sauvignon Blanc. Aggressively herbal on the nose at first, it tones down to yield grassy citrusy flavors and a focused finish.
This is a solidly built wine with ripe black-fruit flavors and lots of texture. It looks deeper than usual, smells like blackberries and black pepper, and tastes dry, full and firmly tannic.
Light in color, with slight, tart, pickled aromas. The palate is sharp-edged, with sour-leaning pie cherry and citric flavors. Scores points for freshness but loses ground with its thin, hollow structure and light, tart flavors.
This 100% varietal wine comes from The Rocks region of the valley. It offers brooding aromas of herbs, dried cherry, licorice and green tea, while the flavors are restrained with cranberry-like tartness and grainy tannins.
95-97. Barrel sample. Showing new wood spice, this rich and full-bodied wine also has weighty fruit, with creamy and herbaceous qualities.
Abelé lays claim to being the third-oldest Champagne house in Reims, and this stylish, sophisticated and thoroughly excellent bottle provides ample evidence that this is an important producer. From the textured, elegant, densely layered nose to the richly toasted flavors and the lingering, sensuous finish, it shows a confident touch with a continental flair.
This medium-dry wine offers a drier core of spice and pepper. Around this, yellow fruits and creamed pears come to the fore. The wine is ready to drink now, although it will be worth waiting until 2016.
This is an attractive, relatively light Sauternes. It has a fine botrytis character that's already well integrated with the orange peel and honey flavors. Not for aging; ready to drink.
This oxidative style of Grillo shows notes of candied fruit, dried apricot, honey and toasted almond. It will appeal to those who enjoy bold, creamy wines.
A blend of three new Syrah clones that were fermented separately, then blended into a satisfying, though still young and somewhat jagged wine that will benefit from more bottle age. It comes out toasty and gamy, with undertones of cured meat, stiff tannins and moist earth. The classic Boushey vineyard flavors of herb, green tea and cured meats are here in abundance.
Tremendous value is offered by this nicely concentrated and intense expression of Barbera. Pure aromas of berries and white cherries emerge from the nose and the wine offers a blast of piquant freshness that would pair with spaghetti carbonara.
Fresh and grassy, with a background of lemons and figs. Drinks clean and vibrant in acids, and finishes dry and clean.
Right now this is a big, tough Cabernet. It's very dry and oaky, and the black and red cherry flavors have a jammy edge. Despite the apparent simplicity, you find yourself returning to it, a good sign that suggests complex ageability. Give it 4–6 years in a cool cellar.
This Bordeaux-style blend is fresh, showing aromas of red currant, tomato leaf, licorice and mint. These notes continue onto the palate along with shots of tart cranberry. This is zippy and enjoyable but needs a little more tannic structure to balance.
Andis's 100% Barbera tempts with ripe, dried black-cherry and mint flavors, and toasty layers of coffee and toffee that linger until the finish.
Rich and intense, it's packed with buttery toasty scents of roasted hazelnuts, floral highlights (jasmine) and clean apple, citrus and pear fruit. Despite the big oak flavors, it keeps its acidity front and center and its flavors lifted.
High-toned lemon and toasted nut notes mark the nose. Medium in body, this has cutting acids, which kick the salivary glands into overdrive.
Rich and dry, with a wealth of blackberry and cherry tart flavors, straight from the oven with the smoky-sweet, cinnamon and burnt butter tang of the crust. You'll notice the tannins, which lend a stimulating structure. This isn't one of those blockbuster cult Merlots, just a red wine of impeccable proportions that yearns to wash down elegant fare.
A very dusty aroma gives a wine that has pepper, green apple and a metallic edge. Finishing with bright acidity, it is ready to drink.
Smells rich and jammy--loaded with cassis and vanilla. In the mouth, there's more of the same, plus added notes of coffee and blackberry allied to a creamy, supple texture. Would rate even higher if not for the relatively short, tart finish.
With bright lemon freshness, this wine positively zings through its ripe melon and pineapple flavors. The balance here between the acidity and richness gives a delicious tension.
A very fresh nose of slight citrus leads to an equally light, slightly lemon-scented palate of ultralight dimensions. There is a hint of riper fruit on the midpalate, but this is simple, refreshing and clean.
A rich, tasty Pinot, packed with black cherry pie filling, cola, orange zest, star anise, cinnamon and sandalwood flavors that finish sweet and long. The texture is satisfying. Drink over the next several years.
This very complete wine offers dark tannins, ripe berry fruits and a velvet texture. It's rich, relying on blackberry and black plum flavors and a dense structure. Mouth-filling, it delivers delicious fragrant acidity at the end. Drink from 2017.
Dry apple and spice aromas accent pear and melon scents. This feels mostly right, with lightly herbal, grassy flavors of apple and citrus that finish with medium intensity.
Valmur is considered to produce a generous style of Grand Cru, and this wine lives up to that. It's warm and rounded while never losing touch with the crisper side of a great Chablis. The ripe white and yellow fruits are on the rich side, cut with citrus acidity and underlined by wood aging. Drink from 2018.
Dusty, leesy aromas are powdery, with little fruit character. This feels stony on the surface but not deep. Nectarine and tangerine flavors finish cidery and slightly bitter.
Barbera can be made well, but this one isn't even particularly Barbera-esque. It's soft, acidic and sweetly simple, with jammy flavors that are overripe and pruny.
With 18 months in French and American oak, this wine is structured with concentrated tannins under its bright, juicy blackberry fruit. Still young and brightly acidic, it's drinkable now but will be better from 2019.
Stout, leathery aromas of black fruits and grilled meats are blackened and a true reflection of Syrah. This is expansive on the palate, but also acidic and abrasive. Flavors of baked black plum, blackberry and fig are intense. A chewy finish is ripped with power, an indication that this will last a long time; drink through 2027.
Here's a big, tannic Zinfandel from a premier vineyard now owned by Gallo. The flavors are bigtime, offering an eruption of blackberries, currants, spiced rum punch, chocolate and licorice. Think of it as Zinfandel on steroids. Calls for equally hefty barbecue, but also has the structure to age interestingly over the next six years, at least.
A blend of equal parts Merlot and Petit Verdot, this offers aromas of underbrush, toast, baked plum, nutmeg and mocha. The smooth palate offers dried blackberries, raisins, cocoa, tobacco and ground black pepper. Velvety tannins hold the flavors together. This has reached its ideal drinking window so enjoy soon.
Café au lait, mocha, wood spice and herb aromas are followed by sweet plentiful black fruit flavors. The tannins give a dry squeeze.
Yeasty bready aromas are more smooth and leesy than fruity. This has a round palate that's full but not creamy due to firm acidity. Melon, peach and vanilla flavors finish yeasty and dry, with moderate complexity. This is made entirely from Pinot Noir.
This has all the size and weight you've come to expect from Australia's most famous wine. Huge fruit and huge oak combine in a full-bodied, richly textured package that delivers waves of toasted coconut, vanilla and intense dark berries yet remains embryonic more than five years after the harvest. That said, the texture isn't quite as tight or as fine as some other vintages—expect this to be early maturing by Grange standards, and best from 2020–2040.
This organic wine was made without added preservatives. After swampy aromas, the flavors are nicely fruity and herbaceous, with a light-medium body and a clean finish.
Full and lush in the mouth, Grant Burge's 10 Year Old is incredibly easy to drink. The toffee and dried fruit notes are lively and fresh, accented by a hint of peppery spice on the finish. A nice change up for those used to tawny Port.
Popcorn on the nose leads to citrus in the mouth, with a touch of oak. The wine verges on being tart, giving it a lively mouthfeel.
Jacaman's been doing a good job with their Russian River Pinot. This one's a bit off the pace of the '03, due to the hotter vintage that makes the wine riper and simpler. But it's still a flavorful, dry, silky wine, with a fair degree of complexity. Drink now.
Aromas of grapefruit, orange peel and chewing gum feed into a wide palate with slightly flat acidity. Melon and papaya flavors finish a bit soft, with a note of stone-fruit pit.
What differentiates this offering is the block selection—all Pommard clone—and a higher (30%) proportion of new cooperage. Warm and generous fruit flavors bring strawberry and cherry in a lushly textured wine that refreshes as it delights. The finish adds extended notes of lemon custard, orange flan and a lick of caramel.
This Chardonnay has fine acidity and even some minerality giving a bracing edge to ripe tropical fruit, peach and citrus flavors. It's heavily oaked, though, and has a soft ripeness that makes the wine almost off dry.
With no rough edges and quite a bit of silky appeal, this earns points for its dry elegance. The flavors are elusive: At first there is a fresh, ripe cherry note, then an olive tapenade element and a moment later a rich earthiness. It is fairly tannic, however, and unlikely to age for very long. Drink now–2014.
Manso ranks among the biggest, most historic and most consistent Chilean Cabernets going. The 2004 isn't perfect but it exhibits classic old-vines blueberry and cassis aromas and flavors. There's not too much obvious oak and the tannins seem a little soft. Which means it's more or less ready to drink now (ahead of the '03).
Cinnamon-cola characterizes this soft, rounded expression of subtle dark cherry and herb. It comes from a sloped vineyard in the middle of the Russian River Valley near Olivet Lane, where moderate temperatures are impacted by morning fog. Layers of toasty oak grace the finish.
The nose announces a resiny, oaky wine. What you don't get from the bouquet is how direct and acidic it is in the mouth. Flavors of citrus and wood are tart and clumsy, while the finish brings a blast of short-lived citrus flavor.
A dark, almost black color is a reminder of Petit Verdot's traditional use to give color in the Bordeaux blend. The wine also has a stylish, aromatic character that brings out black fruits and generous tannins. It's rich and still young. Drink from 2017.
Offers what folks have begun to identify as pretty standard Marlborough Sauvignon, combining a struck-flint character upfront with grassy notes, melon and fig fruit and followed by a citrusy finish. Seems a touch soft; drink now.
The first impression of this Cab is that it's way too young. It has plenty of flash in the ripe Cabernet fruit, rich oak, dense tannins and crisp acidity, but those tannins hold the wine in lockdown, and the parts are far from coming together. In serious need of cellaring, this dynamic young wine should begin to be approachable by 2008.
Muddled stone fruit aromas meld with overripe floral tones on the nose. There's a pop of pineapple and mango fruits on the front, with tangerine leading to a short finish. This is a straightforward but enjoyable fruit-bomb.
Fat fruit, juicy and ripe, brimming with wonderful fruit flavors. The wine is unctuous, sinfully lush, and still balanced with berries and spice and some good toasty oak. Young and hard, but good stuff with a nice life ahead.
This bottling by the respected Silverado winery has been consistent over the years. The 2009 vintage is unsurprisingly quite good and drinkable, with elegance. It's a soft wine, with a creamy mouthfeel framing black cherry, mocha and oak flavors. Ready now.
The great depth of dark cherry fruit in this suave, seamless wine is somewhat obscured now by the menthol-toast oak notes. But even now the supple mouthfeel is seductive, the blackberry and herb flavors compelling, as are the espresso and licorice notes  on the smooth, lengthy finish. Fine fruit and structure will prevail in this keeper. Cellar for two to four years.
This has everything going for it: good intensity, variety of aromas and fresh acidity. It would have scored higher, only it seems to lack that tonic, bubbly edge of other Prosecco—maybe because 15% of other grapes are used. Aromas include lemon zest, sweet basil, peach and white stone.
Smoky and dry for starters, then crisp in the mouth, with bright red fruit flavors of cherry and plum. Picks up oak, heat and sweetness on the finish, but overall this is exactly the type of flavor-packed red wine most people want. Grenache with 15% Syrah.
Shows a prickly side that's true to the variety. Smells and tastes slightly salinic, but also shows good verve and mouthfeel. This is a lively style of SB with citrus and green-apple flavors. It finishes with edgy gooseberry and seems committed to the crisp, lean style (even from warmer Maule Valley).
The 2010 vintage in Chile was quite cool, and that's reflected in this wine. Aromas of berry fruits are lean and underdeveloped. In the mouth, this shows astringency and rubbery tannins, while flavors of red fruits are slightly sharp and a touch green. Drying tannins make for a drawing finish.
The Chermette family has produced a rich generous cru wine. It is structured and dense with some firm tannins from maturing in wood. It also has a generous black plum and cherry fruits that are developing well. Drink this wine from late 2017.
Although the bouquet is a bit scratchy, bright, lightly candied aromas of raspberry and strawberry jam are friendly and welcoming. The wine is firm on the palate and well built, with fresh, slightly jammy tasting plum and berry flavors. And it's lasting and fresh on the finish.
Sugary and astringent, the unusual mix of flavors includes bark, brown sugar and grain. Nothing jells.
San Lorenzo delivers a dark, brooding expression from Montalcino with dense concentration that is accented by smoky notes of cured meat and Indian spice. Fresh tones of cherry and cassis cap the long, fruit-driven fade.
Aromas of corn and melon are waxy and oily. This feels pinched and juicy, but not crisp or minerally. Stalky flavors of corn, citrus and apple lean towards bitter, as does the finish.
Honeyed mango and papaya flavors are accented by a citrus streak that provides much-needed verve, while the aromas are more along the lines of pear and lemon. A solid effort, with only a hint of the musky or foxy quality that can sometimes dominate wines from hybrid grapes.
Despite the cartoonish label, this wine is rough and rugged, with a tannic authority that may mellow with bottle age. Spice, berry, currant and leaf all combine into a wine whose herbal side seems to be its strength.
This is already a delicious wine with its hints of yellow fruits, soft minerality and creamy texture. There is a touch of toast, warm fruitiness and fresh acidity. It's ready to drink now, but will age until 2020.
Flashy oak and deep, pure blackcurrants show from the first whiff, and the purple color stains the sides of the glass in this wine with enough glycerine to float the Sixth Fleet. Doesn't disappoint on the palate, with ripe blackberry flavors and gorgeous, velvety tannins. Closes long, with a sweet, richly-fruited finish. Cellar Selection.
This big soft wine smells and tastes a little sweet, as an aroma like maple syrup leads to flavors of blackberry jam, cinnamon and butter.
A usually reliable performer, Patache d'Aux produced a solid wine in the difficult 2002 vintage. A whiff of mint carries through on the palate, which blends herbs, berries and vanilla in a straightforward claret. Fruit shows through the firm tannins on the finish, suggesting this will improve over the next few years. Drink 2008–2012.
A terrific value for the price, this is a full-bodied, richly textured Shiraz that looks capable of aging through at least 2025. Blueberry and baking-spice notes show the way, leading into a long, dusty finish that would go well with steak or roast beef.
Aggressively oaky in the nose, it follows with a buttery, oaky palate that shows little fruit beyond green-apple tartness.
Despite some richly extracted blackberry and black currant flavors, this wine's tannins and acids are out of whack. They give the wine a sharp, hard mouthfeel, and it actually turns bitter instead of spicy on the finish. Ready now.
An indigenous varietal wine from Spain. Parraleta hails from mountainous Somontano, and this rendition is dark on the nose, with asphalt and licorice aromas. The palate is more tangy and medium, with raspberry, plum and oak. Almost Chianti-like in its body and feel. Good but limited depth of flavors.
This has a great nose, with bright cherry and berry fruit. Berry, black cherry, coffee and earth components combine in a pleasing and muscular blend. The midpalate is broad and chewy, with plenty of liquorous highlights. Tannins are a bit drying and the finish shows some sharp alcoholic burn.
Bryan Babcock's three decades of experience show better than ever right now. This bottling from Radian Vineyard offers aromas of charred cloves, wet slate, peppercorns and macerated raspberries. Lively and energetic on the palate, it bursts with flavors of wild berries and ripe cranberries, with a tart citrusy twist that's a wakeup call to the mouth.
Dry, restrained and a bit mouthpuckering with tannins and acidity, this needs to pair with antipasti like Italian salumi. Its lean texture and tart cherry and cranberry flavors do make it appetizing and help it stand out from the crowd of simply ripe California reds.
Violet, rose, mature black fruit, leather and baking spice aromas open this smooth, structured wine. The palate offers prune, dried cherry, nutmeg and mocha alongside assertive, drying tannins. Drink 2016–2023.
There are impressive aromas here of stone and passion fruits, dried herbs and thick, nutty overtones at the back. The acidity is refreshing and cool but the wine also boasts solid, firm structure. Try this sparkler with smoked salmon canapés.
Fruity aromas of pressed grapes and blackberry are repeated on the slightly sweet, informal palate. Zesty acidity keeps it fresh while it closes on a slightly bitter note.
This is a green and sharp expression of Cabernet Sauvignon that shows some unripe aromas of green pepper and laurel leaf behind forest berry and blackberry. In the mouth, however, the wine is silky and smooth.
This is a light-bodied, lightly textured wine from one of the producer's coolest sites, minty and herbal in a taste of forest floor and strawberry. Citrus and pomegranate provide additional crispness and freshness on the palate.

Very youthful and fruit forward with an emphasis on blueberries and violets. The finish is nice, not incredibly lengthy, but determined and linear. A nicely packaged Sicilian red with finesse and power. Imported by Laird & Company.

This vineyard, just behind the Bourgeois winery, has the steepest slope in Sancerre. With a brilliant exposure to the sun it is capable of producing totally ripe rich wines.

Sweet and a little chemical smelling, with stemmy, citrusy red fruit flavors. The palate is light and narrow, with heat. Short on the finish and not what you'd call surprising, but given the $7 price tag it is not a bad wine.

Vintage seems to have made all the difference in this 100% Cabernet. The 2005 was rich and fat, the 2006 less so. You'll find plenty of acidity framing the juicy blackberry and black currant flavors. It seems to be very finely layered, so your best bet is to cellar it for 6–8 years and see what happens.

If you choose one wine to stick in the cellar from the '03 vintage, make it this one. It's so dry, balanced and complex, yet so tannicly tough now, that it demands a good 6 years, at a minimum.

As delicious as the wine is now, especially with decanting, it really will benefit from aging.

There's a fine wine hiding inside this Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend, which contains Cabernet Franc and Merlot. But its qualities are buried beneath strong tannins. The fruit is impossibly young, all jammy cherries and blackberries, and new oak sticks out in the form of buttered toast. It's all very imposing, so don't even think about drinking it anytime soon. Should begin to blossom around 2018, and will be going strong for another decade.

Smells invitingly fine, with a classic rotie Syrah nose, but quickly turns Porty and sweetly hot in the mouth, with the flavor of stewed raisins and a sugary finish.
The lightly fruity flavors conjure cranberry and raspberry, with moderate acidity. This young wine should improve with further bottle age. Best to tuck it away for another three or four years.

The tannins of this refined yet full-bodied Cabernet come across as sinfully silky in texture, giving the wine a sense of softness while still providing structure. Smoke, maple syrup and cassis notes gracefully intertwine on the nose and palate, then end on a long, cedar-laced finish. Drink now–2020.
This medium weight Chardonnay offered aromas of overripe pineapple and citrus with an odd note somewhere between citrus and varnish. The apple and mild citrus flavors lack vitality, and turn overly tart on the finish.
An herbal wine, rather green in character and missing fruitiness. Structure and cherry fruits are there but lost in this green stalky character.
L. A mostly clean wine that hints at earth and leather but settles on basic red fruit. The palate shows mild, manageable snap and sharpness, while the palate deals flavors of red fruits, rubber and leather. Lean and clean, but basic as they come.

A huge wine, bright and bold in raspberry and cherry flavors, this has a jammy directness that makes it drinkable now, but such is the acid and tannin structure that it should develop bottle complexity over the next 6–8 years. The alcohol is a refreshingly low 13.5% by volume, a testament to the coolness of the 2010 vintage.
A subdued nose of ripe, scented yellow Reine Claude and mirabelle plums suggests a sun-kissed wine. The palate reinforces this stone-fruited richness with elements of apricot and peach compote. This is off-dry but delicately balanced, rich but not opulent. Soft and gentle harmoniousness pervades from start to long finish.
The aromas pop, with notes of sliced green pepper and jalapeño pepper, leaning very hard into the green. The palate brings more of the same, drinking more like a Carmenere than a Cabernet.
Smoky and round, with big black fruit delivering a serious opening salvo. Like most from Lapostolle, this is a big-boned red with full plum and black cherry aromas and flavors. Plenty of oak yields vanilla and chocolate late. A solid, very nice Chilean Merlot. Imported by Moët Hennessy USA.
Starts strong, with a lovely bouquet of bruised apple. The palate, however, doesn't quite measure up; the pretty apple theme continues but there's a wateriness and a simplicity that disappoints. Finishes fresh and bright.
This leads with blue flower, camphor, crushed herb and red berry aromas. Firmly structured and linear, the palate delivers succulent red cherry, crushed strawberry, cinnamon and star anise flavors supported by a backbone of vibrant acidity and firm, refined tannins. Drink 2022–2032.
The name references the two vintages blended together. Of more interest is the mix of eight different red grapes, principally Sangiovese, Cabernet and Cab Franc. It's dark, oaky and quite tannic, showing some bitterness as a result.
This blend of 55% Shiraz and 45% Cabernet Sauvignon is full bodied and rather tannic, with dark notes that run the gamut from leather and grilled meat to espresso and mocha. Fortunately, the texture turns velvety on the finish, allowing some mouthwatering elements to shine through. Drink now–2020.
Dark- colored wine, powered with Touriga Nacional over ripe wood and black fruit flavors. Big, firm and tannic, there's an herbal element that adds complexity to the rich, sweet fruit with its core of dryness.
Leathery, dried cherry fruit flavors are set against streaks of earth, herb and a hint of barnyard. It's soft and eminently accessible, the tannins smooth and supple, with a hint of vanilla.
Great wine and great value, too. The nose is a blend of floral, graphite and cassis aromas, while the firm and rugged palate is packed with sweet, friendly cookie, chocolate, coffee and berry flavors. If the tannins seem a little aggressive now, time should come to the rescue. Otherwise, there's very little to pick at and a lot more to praise.
Some foliage aromas are echoed in the mouth along with dark fruit and banana. Medium weight and structured tannins provide a full body, leading into a strong but somewhat waxy finish.
The grapes from this blend come from some of Napa's best vineyards. The wine is soft, fruity and frankly delicious, with waves of berries, cherries, spices and caramelized new French oak. Dazzles now for sheer decadence, but so rich, it's hard to tell where it's going.
92–94. Barrel sample. Considerable wood aging yields notes of vanilla and spice on this smooth, modern wine. There's ample ripe fruit to add balance, but it's going to be a generous wine, revealing a rich, full character.
Cherry and mild sawdust aromas are brought down by sharpness that is almost vinegar-like. The palate has an acceptable mouthfeel along with sweet and sour flavors of plum and berry. Tart on the finish, and a bit stemmy and sharp throughout.
The packaging and name are a little contrived, but what's in the bottle stands up to scrutiny. The aromas are warm and plummy, with a hint of toast and cream. The palate is clean and juicy, with snappy black raspberry fruit and a fruity carry-over onto the finish. Spunky, fresh and pleasant.
The nose beguiles, with scents of vanilla, freshly baked bread and wet stones that give way to tones of lemon and apricot on the tongue. This wine is light-bodied and crisp, a good summer sipper. Drink up over the next year, perhaps with a piece of grilled fish.
This shows clean aromas of blue flower, wild berry and cola, with a touch of moist earth or tobacco. The close is simple and slightly sour.
A very nice Cab Franc that shows how well this variety can do in the Sierra Foothills. It's quite soft and light in body, making it a wine for early drinking. But it offers waves of cherries, anisettte liqueur, cocoa, pepper and mint flavors that are delicious.
Seafood platters loaded with steamed mussels and spicy crab cakes call out for a fresh, vibrant Vernaccia just like this bottling. Massimo Daldin offers touches of vanilla cream, yellow fruits and nuts, which give it momentum and character.
Peach, apricot, exotic fruit, apple, lemon rind and white stone characterize this fruity and fresh bubbly. It's slightly sweet but with a refreshing vein of tartness that completes a pretty picture.
This offers a wonderful bouquet of white flower, peach, tangerine skin and honey. The mouthfeel is creamy, rich, sweet and smooth, with a touch of clean acidity at the end.
A nice Cab for the price due to the full-bodied richness and ripe fruity flavor. It's big in blackberry jam and spices, with a coating of smoky oak. Easy to find, with 115,000 cases produced.
Fresh and vibrant grapefruit, lemon and crisp apple aromas join equally lively citrus flavors in this medium-bodied, not-too-tart wine. It's refreshing and clean, pairing especially well with seafood.
Raspberry and blackberry aromas usher in twangy, thin berry fruit on the palate. A good wine with mass-market appeal, finishing with Sweet Tart flavors.
Aromas of white flower and peach pulp reinforce this sparkler's overall softness and creaminess.
Super dense and hard as a rock, with bacon and black fruit aromas that lead straight to a saturated, chewy, tannic palate that pounds away as it delivers blackberry, coffee, licorice and other huge flavors. As big, baked and heavy as they come, with gargantuan tannins. Includes 15% Syrah in addition to Monastrell.
A savory and meaty expression of Syrah, this opens with enticing aromas of dark cherry, leather, cured meat and wet earth. The palate is extra smooth and soft, with flavors like pistachio and almond, that pin the wine to Sicily.
With vines close to the sea, this estate has produced a strongly mineral wine with a firm edge as well as plenty of red-berry fruits. The wine is crisp and full-bodied without losing any of the balancing acidity. Drink the wine now.
This dark, potent, full-bodied wine is made from two of the darkest, most tannic grape varieties—Petit Verdot and Petite Syrah—and there is nothing petite about this blend. Its color is almost black and opaque, while aromas and flavors suggest smoke, blueberry and espresso. The texture is tannic but not overbearing.
Aromas of marionberry jam and smoke leap out of the glass, along with orange peel and wilted flower notes that seem a bit unsettled. The flavors are plump around the edges but light in the middle, with a mesquite note that distracts.
The Lorna Marie is the winery's reserve-level bottling, and gets the most new oak, about 60%. In this vintage, the fruit seems a bit thin, almost watery, although with some hours of breathing it gains some palate traction. It's well made, but don't look for reserve-level heft.
With little or no oak, the fruit and acidity star in this dry, crisp young white wine. It's strong in pineapple, lime, Meyer lemon, orange rind and spice flavors. Very nice by itself as a cocktail sipper, and versatile at the table.
Violet in color but sassy. The nose is pickled and brambly, while the palate offers crusty berry fruit and herbal, marinated flavors. Edgy and sharp as feel goes, with an angular, acid-driven finish.
Subdued aromas of black currant, chocolate and a whiff cedar lead the nose of this blend of 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Cabernet Franc, 30% Merlot and 10% Petit Verdot. On the palate, notes of grilled bell pepper, soy sauce and game accent a core of dried black cherry. It's simple and a bit rustic, with dusty, drying tannins.
This is a McLaren Vale classic, produced from vines planted in 1892. It's a full-bodied, chewy style that marries cedar and mint to deep, plummy fruit. Like many of the big-name Australian Shirazes, this doesn't require cellaring, but will reward it, at least through 2020.
Definitely a cheerful rosé with a brilliant ruby color and subtle amber reflections, this easy-to-drink wine delivers cranberries, rose petal, white chocolate and sweet raspberry. It's simplistic but refreshing and tart in the mouth.
All three of Plantagenet's Shirazes were successful in 2008. This, the flagship bottling, offers aromas of coffee grounds, cherry and cracked black pepper, adding vanilla, spice and charred beef flavors on the palate. It's harmonious, savory and complex. Drink now–2020 and possibly beyond.
Does a good job of balancing ripe, forward cherry-berry fruit with a nice application of oak and gritty tannins. Drink now and for the next year or two before it loses freshness.
This new Bordeaux-style red could technically be labeled Cabernet Sauvignon, as it accounts for 82% of the blend. Pungently smoky, the impression of charred wood penetrates into the deep core of cassis and black cherry. Dark and quite tannic, it remains to be seen if all that barrel toast will ultimately meld into the rest of the wine.
Acidity and ripe fruit mark this Chardonnay, which is lovely to drink now. Don't chill it too much, to allow the orange, pineapple and passionfruit flavors to express their nuances.
All varietal from up-and-coming Scooteney Flats Vineyard, this wine displays aromas of fresh herbs, dark raspberries and barrel spices. There's no lack of richness to the fruit flavors but the chalky tannins need time to stitch together.
Barolo Monvigliero is a standout wine that fully encompasses the greater philosophy of the 2007 vintage. This opulent and seriously delicious wine opens with dark, brooding concentration and sweet oak and berry fruit aromas followed by vanilla, leather and tobacco. Pulpy fruit flavors help move the wine smoothly over the palate. Drink in 5–10 years to let the tannic structure subside.
Leather, aromatic herb, mature dark-skinned fruit and a balsamic note take center stage. The full-bodied palate shows ripe wild cherry, black raspberry, mint and anise framed in enveloping refined tannins. Drink 2018–2023.
The Two Vines lineup consistently offers some of the best value wines made in Washington, but this is not their best effort. It's thin to the point of watery, with rather sharp, acidic fruit tasting mildly of cherry candy. There's no weight beyond that; it's clean and one-dimensional, a one-note red wine.
From a mountainous vineyard known for its grit and brawn, this wine presents exactly that—a powerful, grippy experience of generous fruit and tannin that's nonetheless complex in a mix of leather, chocolate and coffee. The acidity provides a high-toned undercurrent that makes it enjoyable and ponderous.
A dark and spicy wine, with streaks of mineral and herb buried within very tart, acidic black fruit. This is complex, quite youthful and tightly woven. I think it will require some years to pull itself together, but the balance is here, in a medium-bodied style, showing some herb, some citrus and plenty of muscle. Tasted over many hours after being decanted, it showed itself to be a wonderful wine that developed multiple layers of flavor.
A straightforward Pinot Noir from Mendocino's inland Potter Valley, the wine is dominated by a layer of spearmint that overcomes the more nuanced flavors of cherry and raspberry.
Drunken peach, green apple, gray slate and rounded butter notes hit the nose. There is a baking soda minerality on the palate, some sea salt and a tongue-tingling acidity.
Aromas of coconut, toast, plum and vanilla shine in this hearty red. The aromas follow through to the ripe palate along with crushed black cherry, sage and chocolate. It's round and ready to drink, with modest acidity and chewy tannins. Enjoy through 2016.
Francesco Galliano is a creamy and opulent Chardonnay-based sparkler that opens with a deep golden color, yeasty notes followed by butter and toasted almond. The wine shows loads of ripe and sticky fruit that almost bring it over the top.
This is a dark, young and impressively fruity wine. It's massive in plum, cherry and chocolate flavors, but has subtle nuances of dried herbs and flowers that make it complex. Very dry and stylish, with soft, lush tannins that make it instantly drinkable.
A big cherry-vanilla style of Brunello, with bold aromas and flavors held in check by a slightly acrid, weedy note. Warming on the finish, with a dose of spice and supple tannins.
Melon and apple aromas are at first stony, then more mealy. This feels sturdy enough, with dry yeasty white-fruit flavors. On the finish, this turns increasingly bready, yeasty and less fresh.
This is an excellent vintage in Washington, and Bob Bertheau has made a soft, smooth, well-crafted Sauvignon Blanc. Just a bit more than one-third was barrel fermented, and the blend is 100% varietal. It's a fruity, polished effort with citrusy highlights, but I'd love to see the winemaker veer a bit more towards a Washington State-style that includes some sweet grassiness in the finish.
This is lighter in mouthfeel than the other Tertulia reds, but with tasty toast, vanilla and caramel balancing fresh red fruits. Despite its lightness, it shows a lot of flavor and persistence, and it should benefit from a bit more bottle time.
Shows lovely balance between intense sweetness and crisp acidity, so that the wine's honeyed citrus notes really sing. Hints of marmalade, clove and a perfumed, slightly minty note all add complexity. Delicious now, and probably for a good many years to come.
Packaged in a handsome bottle with an embossed viper on the front, this blend of Merlot, Sangiovese (with a small percentage of Montepulciano for extra power and intensity) offers easy sensations of ripe fruit and exotic spice. The low price makes it even more attractive.
Smells great and flashy, with inviting notes of blackberries, black currants, green olives and spicy sandalwood. Candied and sweet in the mouth, with blackberry and black cherry fruit. Tasted in March, 2011, the wine could well have been going through an awkward period. Should re-emerge by Fall and age well.
From the northern Portuguese heartland of Alvarinho, this beautifully ripe and rich wine is packed with intense perfumes of white peach and green apple. Fresh fruit and crisp acidity give a lively, tangy aftertaste. Drink from late 2015.
The wine makes a wonderful first impression thanks to its vibrant intensity and penetrating aromas of cherry, cola, almond and spice. Shaped by consulting enologist Carlo Ferrini, it would do an excellent job of cleaning the palate after a steaming dish of spaghetti, grated Parmigiano cheese and tomato sauce.
A very pretty pale salmon color, this wine is principally Grenache (64%) and Roussanne (23%) with the rest Counoise and Lemberger. Aromas of watermelon and rosewater are followed by just off-dry, mouthwatering citrus and cherry flavors that linger.
This wine's delicate nose offers white spring flower, Mediterranean herb and wet stone aromas. They carry over to the fresh palate, along with fruity green apple and pineapple notes while a savory mineral note backs up the finish.
Rusty rose in color, this Southern California stab at Sherry is quite rewarding, showing caramelized pecans and almonds, light tobacco leaf and a touch of iodine on the extremely nutty nose. Light peat and walnut flavors show on the sip, as does sour marzipan and burnt orange peel, with a roasted-almond-laced finish.
Dark hay in color with a concentration of oak on the nose, the palate retains that richness of nutty almond and apple pie, finding a balance that betrays the heavier implications of the initial aromas. On the finish it offers a lightness of being, as well as a touch of perfume.
This is an impressive Barolo by a wine company (with superstar consulting enologist Carlo Ferrini at the head of winemaking) that is relatively new to the scene. Due Corti proves this winery knows what it's doing. Aromas of red rose, violet and exotic spice come forward immediately. Indeed, this is an extremely floral and perfumed wine with silky, smooth tannins.
This crisp Chardonnay conveys aromas of lemon blossom and mature pear. The refreshing palate offers juicy yellow apple, citrus and a hint of mineral brightened by zesty acidity.
92-94 Barrel sample. Rich and creamy, showing ripe Sauvignon fruits, hinting at tropical. The fruit is certainly ripe, full in the mouth, but has preserved a good, tight structure and freshness
KJ's Avant bottling is refreshing with fruity essence, showing sweet flavors of honey, peaches, apricots and nectarines. With only a touch of oak, it has a bright, fresh mouthfeel that makes it especially attractive.
Barrel fermented and aged sur lie in 40% new French oak. The 2008 vintage has kept its acids (hence balance) better than the 2007; though there is still some volatility, it's just over the threshold level for most people. There's plenty of fruit—banana, papaya, pineapple—along with the barrel-generated streaks of caramel.
An elaborate Chardonnay whose high acidity and minerality are reflections of both the vintage and Carneros terroir. Shows bright, zesty flavors of pineapples, tangerines and green apples, while lots of opulent new French oak brings vanilla and toast richness, as well as supportive wood tannins.
The wine is almost honey-colored, and scented with sweet hay and clover. That impression of sweet grass carries over into the mouth, and it adds life and lift to the rather rich and heavy fruit. Don't look for it to improve or to age beyond a year or two. The blend includes 7% Sauvignon Blanc.
There is definite richness here. This is a wine that has a mineral structure inside an opulent and ripe outer skin. The fruits run the range from pear to black currants to tropical flavors, all given a delicious spicy edge. Age for 2–4 years.
Tight, lean, severe, this wine only has a hint of fruit. It is firm, on the thin side, not a pleasure.
Exotic and complex, this medium-bodied, structured wine is awash with aromas, from charcuterie and mixed nut to cedar and pencil. Anchoring it is a dusty tannic profile and a punch of oak.
Dark garnet in color with an intense nose loaded with blackberries, cassis and sweet tobacco. The palate offers more black fruit skin notes along with coffee granules and cocoa powder, with mocha dominating the lingering finish.
Not much going on. Clean and dry, with watery flavors of apples and oak.
Showing fresh watermelon and canteloupe flavors, this light-bodied, dry wine is crisp in texture, with enough concentration to be mouth-filling. It's made frm 80% Barbera and 20% red Rhône varieties.
Vigne Alte Bardolino boats a very immediate delivery of aromas that come forth as wild berry, white cherry and red apple. This is a simple and genuine wine with good intensity and purity. It leaves the palate clean and refreshed thanks to the natural freshness it imparts on the close.
More complex than the winery's appellation blend, yet also requiring time to reach full potential, this shows delicate lemon slices, honeysuckle, surf wax, pink grapefruit and a touch of coconut on the nose. The palate is grippy in texture and sizzling with mouthwatering acidity, offering lemon rind, grapefruit spritz and petrol flavors. Expect inviting nut and honey-dust flavors to emerge. Drink 2018–2034.
This is a young, gold-colored wine that is more rich than really sweet. It has acidity, ripe apricot and sweet apple flavors that give the wine fresh acidity. The wine is still developing, pushing the ripe fruits through the texture, so don't drink until 2019.
Produced from a single clone—Dijon 777—this late release has a hint of leather around candied cherry fruit, mixed with sweetened cranberry. It's concentrated and rounded off, with brown spice highlights. Drink now to 2020.
This is a new wine from Longboard. The vineyard is on Westside Road, in the Middle Reach area that is prime Pinot country. But somehow, Merlot loves it. Softly lush and complex, with blackberry, blueberry, cherry, cola and spiced coffee flavors, finishing with new oaky vanillins. Really notable for its balance and harmony.
Pie cherries that carry a good snap of puckery tartness are the principal fruit flavor . The wine is already rounded off, fruity and buoyant, with generous acidity and a tasty sprinkle of baking spices. The persistence and detail are impressive.
Sarmassa offers slightly more opulence and a fuller palate of flavors (compared to the estate's Cannubi cru) with lingering tones of dark chocolate, cinnamon, pressed flowers and forest fruit. The mouthfeel is soft and generous with round notes of tobacco and spice.
A blend of typical Gascon grapes gives a lemon and citrus wine, very fresh, tangy. There is plenty of acidity and an attractive lightness. Screwcap.
Nothing charming about this wine, which is sweet, acidic and fruity, like a Lifesaver pineapple and lemon candy. Pretty expensive for what you get.
A very pure line of blackberry and dark cherry flavors distinguish this wine. It is certainly structured—underneath the fruit there are plenty of fruit and wood tannins—but the ripe fruit flavors dominate. Based on fruit from the Jonkershoek valley, this shows a fine minerally side, compliments of the granite subsoil.
This is a beautiful Moscato d'Asti with peach mousse, tangerine, white almond, honey, ginger and spring flower. Perfect for nut-based desserts, the sparkler is soft and sweet with a distant touch of tangy spice on the finish.
Some of the freshness is already going and the wine is morphing into pear and peach juice flavors. There is still an apple skin texture to give some crispness.
Very tart, with barely ripe flavors of rhubarb and wild raspberries, this late release is already showing bricking around the rim. It's high in acid but low in fruit flavor, and from the looks of it, should be consumed immediately.
This is a ripe wine with generous black fruits and crisp acidity. It is balanced—fruity with a core of tannins. Drink from 2018.
With high alcohol giving it body and heat, this Zin defines the ripe, exuberant Paso style. It's deep in blackberry, tobacco, black pepper and raisin flavors that finish dry and clean.
Veins of crushed slate and spice lend complexity to this spine-tingling wine. Fresh, sweet tangerine and stone-fruit flavors are concentrated yet pristine, bolstered by streaks of lemon and grapefruit acidity. The finish meanders long, nuanced by hints of bramble and earth.
What a perfumed, elegant, structured wine, with all the elements of fruit, wood, tannins just in the right place. It shows great tannins, powerful black and red berry fruits, denseness, and a classic, fresh aftertaste.
Gets going in woody fashion, which unleashes cinnamon and coconut. Airing brings it into focus, and from then on it's all about cherry and cassis flavors, and a nice vanilla and mint finish. Classic Chilean Cabernet: fruit plus terroir plus wood equals a good result. Imported by W.J. Deutsch & Sons.
Aromas of chocolate and toasted hazelnut open the bouquet of this darkly concentrated wine. The palate offers a cherry flavor, with plush softness, chewy tannins and flavorful intensity.
95–97. Barrel sample. Dominated by Cabernet Franc, this is a firm, solid and beautifully perfumed wine, lighter than some wines from Ausone. The tannins are velvet although with a strong mineral character. It's fruity at the same time as being structured—a wine for long-term aging.
Odd aromas of clove are smoky but mostly come across as weird and forced. This has a lactic, creamy mouthfeel with soft edges. The flavor profile is all wood, and resiny, clove-driven wood at that. A severely sweet, cloying, resiny finish is a lot to deal with.
The blend is 60% Roussanne, 40% Marsanne, apparently barrel-fermented and aged, as the toast, smoke and coffee elements dominate the nose and palate. There's enough fruit concentration to support the oak in a honeyed, mealy way that shows off the wine's breadth and texture. Drink now.
A bit rugged to start with, with solid berry and crusty dark aromatics. The palate has good size and cushion, with a creamy feel housing soft baked plum, herb, cough drop and vanilla flavors. A little woody on the finish, which fades with a modicum of grace. Neither edgy nor aggressive.
Savory sandalwood, leather and black fruit are surrounded by a strong, persistent grip of solid tannin in this spicy, cola-layered wine.
Cassis liqueur marks this structured Cab divine in firm, lengthy tannins and a chewy grip of black licorice. Given similar treatment to the winery's other highest echelon Cabs, it has 22 months in new French oak that will help it age through 2020–2030.
Densely tannic wine, certainly not ready to drink, with dusty tannins over ripe fruit, powered by a dry core of minerality. The wine is solid, with structure first and rich fruit after.
A good Cabernet, if a little gritty, with herb-infused flavors of black currants, plums and spices. Might soften with a few years in the bottle, but not really a longterm ager.
This lovely blend of Sauvignon Blanc, and 14% Roussanne, is as crisp and fresh as its name implies. Bright fruit flavors of lemon, lime, orange and pineapple speak to the success of this unusual blend. It's a bracing, palate-cleansing white wine that will be appealing all year round.
Ripe enough grapes, filled with blueberry and black raspberry and pepper flavors, and on the smooth and mellow side. That said, there's a rustic quality, jagged and earthy, and a hint of bitterness in the finish that detracts. —S.H.
Dry and fruity, this country-style wine has thick tannins and some green acidity that calls for very rich, simple fare, such as a cheesburger or sloppy joe.
Ripe apple aromas make the nose nice, even though it's flattening with age. Likewise on the palate, which delivers pithy orange and dry melon flavors along with indications that it's just starting to fade. Notes of green herbs and scallion come up on the finish. Drink this mature white immediately.
Black pepper, mature plum and a whiff of damp soil carry over to the dense palate along with chopped herb and black-cherry extract. Assertive close-grained tannins provide the framework and leave a dusty, drying finish.
This offers aromas of jasmine, hawthorn and ripe pear. The round palate delivers creamy green apple, white peach, tangerine zest and a note of honeyed almond accompanied by racy acidity and a foaming mousse.
Powerful and rich, this has sweet tannins that overlay a juicy blackberry-jelly flavor. It is sumptuous and opulent, squeezing out every bit of richness. It has weight, and its tannins offer a fine future.
A powerful, audacious Viognier, explosive in tropical fruit, vanilla, buttered toast and butterscotch flavors. All that richness is balanced by crisp acidity and a fine minerality. Still, it's a big, honeyed wine for drinking now.
This is a powerful but not exaggerated style of Amarone that delivers ripe cherry and blackberry aromas followed by new leather, cigar box, spice and rum cake. It imparts a very smooth, rich and supple feel.
A dense, full-bodied red, this opens with aromas of blackberry jam, vanilla, oak and a whiff of herbs. The robust palate delivers fleshy black cherry, cracked black pepper, licorice and tobacco alongside velvety tannins. You'll also the notice the heat of evident alcohol, especially on the close, which throws it somewhat off-balance.
Fresh and complex. Layers of citrus peel, pineapple, oak and a fruity compôte. Bone dry, crisp. Lots of minerality, stone. Creamy. Fabulous, long, firm quality. Fresh, smooth, dryish-sweet, long satisfying finish. From old vines.
Yeasty aromas of white flowers and ham don't stir much interest. This feels medium in body and fairly bland. Yeasty flavors of vanilla and white fruits are more nondescript than particular.
Young and tightly wound, this compact cuvée marries cranberry and raspberry fruit to proportionate tannins and a touch of acidity. There is a hint of clean earth as well.
Aggressive all the way, with a heartily toasted nose that conceals leather and stable aromas. Quite tannic and bitter on the palate, but also loaded with coffee and background notes of coconut. Imported by W. J. Deutsch & Sons.
With a bit of Merlot, Petit Verdot and Malbec, this Cab is marked by hard tannins and blackberry and cherry jam, black currant and oak flavors. The finish is gripping, however, it's pretty tart, and you have to wonder if that sharpness will ever age out. Decant and drink up.
Lovely aromas of toasted nuts and lemon curd are backed up on the palate by hints of melon and citrus. This is an elegant, understated Chardonnay with a silky texture worthy of pairing with refined fish and chicken dishes. Drink it over the next 6–12 months.
Organically certified grapes from the Oak Ridge vineyard create a delicate Gewürztraminer that seems to float on a bed of sweet balm, lemony citrus and wet stone. it's dry, graceful and tangy, with no hint of residual sugar.
Dry and grassy, even herbaceous, with a streak of cat pee, this simple wine has crisp acidity that makes the tastebuds whistle.
Although Palliser's wines are represented in the U.S., the Chardonnays are not, which is a shame given the evident quality. This is a medium- to full-bodied wine, marked with honey, toast, peach and orange aromas and bold pineapple flavors, yet it finishes crisp, not sweet, buttery or cloying.
Very true to the variety, this is a soft, barnyardy, raspberry flavored wine. With its ripe fruit and well integrated tannins, it has a smooth mouthfeel that is freshened with acidity on the finish.
Toasty and nutty on the nose, this is a lush, fruit-filled Burgundy that nevertheless retains a sense of minerality amid its baked-apple flavors. It's plump and custardy in texture, with ample power and concentration, turning minerally on the finish.
Keenan's 2002 regular is very good. The Reserve emulates all its fine qualities and far exceeds it in richness. This is a soft yet complex wine, rich in supple tannins, with extraordinary flavors of blackberry-laced espresso and pure, dark unsweetened chocolate. As dry as it is, the finish is as sweet as crème de cassis.
Smoke, char and dark fruit aromas are followed by full-bodied blackberry flavors. The tannins bring some grittiness that holds it back.
Now maturing, this retains its red fruits; its bright texture and acidity go with the firm tannins and dark structure. It is balanced and ready to drink.
This offers aromas of mature black fruit and raisin. The palate delivers a vibrant black-cherry core, layered with accents of black pepper and Asian spice. It also has fresh acidity for the vintage, and will pair well with buttery dishes or cured meats.
Adorned by a beautiful label, this aromatic white is resplendent in lychee, pear and orange blossom as well as marked minerality. Dry, the finish is slightly spicy and entirely memorable.
Perfumed in rose and violet, with a sauvage scent of musk, this distinctive wine is soft and silky on the palate. It features a mix of red cherry and sage, with a full body and an expansive and lengthy finish.
Planted in 2001 above the Laguna de Santa Rosa near Sebastopol, Baranoff Vineyard is tightly spaced to mostly Calera-clone Pinot, providing the wine's bright raspberry and cherry overtones atop a layering of earth and spice. Thickly structured, it finishes with tart cherry.
A wine that is strangely hollow with structure and juicy fruit around a hole in the center. Spice and red berry flavors are contrasted with dry tannins that may not soften.
Ripe and bold, it balances acidity and texture. Very mineral in character, it is textured and tight at this young stage. Green fruits, citrus and red apples show the fruity side. Age until 2016.
The blend of Pinot Noir and Gamay gives a wine with weight and richness as well as a tight, mineral character. The wine is full in the mouth with its creamy mousse and fine pear and citrus fruits. A wine for food rather than apéritif.
A pliant, medium- to full-bodied wine, this deals ripe stone fruit and golden raisin flavors, plus toasty, oxidative tones.
Black plum and fig notes laced with sweet spice define this medium-bodied wine. Soft tannins with an overall approachable structure; drink now.
This wine hails from the Sonoma Coast sections of the Russian River Valley and Petaluma Gap. It delivers in terms of price-versus-quality by opening with strong scents of earth and black plum baked in cinnamon and clove. Light, it's soft on the palate and finishes lean.
A blend of Arinto and Alvarinho, this is a fresh and crisp wine that also has a richer side to it. Produced in the same region as Vinho Verde, it is bone dry, full of apple and kiwi fruit flavors within a tight, tangy texture. Drink now.
Bright violet in color and well extracted, but also vegetal. You'd think from the hue and vintage that it would be seamlessly ripe, but it seems green at the core. Thus while it delivers texture, rich plum fruit and tannic structure, there's a gap in  clarity of fruit flavor.
This wine has soft tannins, with heaps of vanilla-cherry and raspberry notes and a herbal hit on the finish that leans green. A blend of 88% Zinfandel, with smaller amounts of Petite Sirah, Teroldego and Barbera from one of Amador's historic producers.
This offers aromas of mature plum, berry, toasted oak and coffee. The straightforward palate offers roasted coffee beans, espresso, dried black cherry and licorice alongside fine-grained tannins. The fruit is starting to dry up, so drink soon.
Judging by the success of this wine, St. Laurent seems to be this winery's signature grape. It is big, bold and packed with tannins as well as dense fruit. It's a solid- and dark-textured wine. Not yet ready to drink, this is worth aging for a few more years.
Slender citrus zestiness is the theme here: is it bergamot or lime? The wonderfully rich core of phenolics provides heft and pith with a touch of white pepper here and there and a mossy savouriness that provides welcome refreshment.
This is a good, dry, somewhat rugged Cabernet, rich in varietal blackberry and black currant flavors with a coating of smoky oak. It's fully ready to drink now. Shows real elegance in the refined mouthfeel, and the spicy finish is a delight.
Apple and peach aromas are smooth, sophisticated and minerally. This special-selection, aged Albariño is citrusy but full in body. Orange, nectarine and papaya flavors finish with strong composition. At this stage, this is more about feel, texture and complexity than flavors. Drink now.
The oak is very present, so give this a few more years of cellar aging for it to integrate. Chocolate, Christmas spices, leather, toasted almonds and coffee grounds make a grand first impression. As the wine evolves in the glass, cherry and black currant aromas surface.
Fruity and forward, with jammy apricot, pear, pineapple and vanilla cream flavors, girded with a tang of minerals. Grown on the Sonoma side of Carneros.

Sort of a reserve version of the Zachary's Ladder, this is a 60/40 Syrah/Cabernet blend. Some of the Syrah has been barrel fermented, and the finished wine spent 21 months in new French oak.

Best 2007–2012, or decant to let it breathe.
This is a peppery, almost dry wine, with pear and green plum flavors. It is soft and light, and its lively, zesty acidity makes this a refreshing apéritif style.

Two things to know about this bubbly. It's slightly sweet, and it's rather rough in texture. Those bubbles are big and scoury. They almost make you sneeze. The lemon tart flavors are tasty.
Deep purple in color; this is a classic young grapeball across the bouquet, with sweet candied fruit aromas. The palate is plump and full of youthful blackberry flavors, while the finish is moderately chewy and substantive. Not a finesse-driven wine by any means; but good if you like simple, forward fruit character.
The vineyard has been source of good Zinfandel for V. Sattui, and this is their best yet. The wine is enormously rich and ripe in berry, cherry, currant, mocha and pepper flavors, but its structure really warrants attention. Perfectly firm tannins, fine acidity, and a touch of minerality gives the wine grounding. The alcohol is high, but in keeping with the wine's expression.
Stalky aromas make for a sketchy opening. In the mouth, this is blocky and grabby in feel. Burnt, underripe flavors of berry fruits are herbal and finish with grassy notes.

A bold, rich wine fringed with tannins, at a young age it already shows a solid structure of ripe and juicy berry tones. With well-balanced oak aging, slightly toasty notes show restraint on this dark and complex wine that has potential to age. Drink after 2016.
Iscay means “two” in a native Incan language, and it represents the wine's composition of 50% Malbec and 50% Merlot.

Very nice but not as interesting as the single-vineyard Malbecs.

As so often, Niepoort comes through with a fabulous wine. It is dry and structured, with mature flavors that suggest there are wines in the blend that are older than 10 years.

An exotic style of Chardonnay with tropical fruit, pear, white flower and honey flavors. It's atypical for the variety, but delicious. Drink now, not too cold.
Fizzy and foamy and aggressive. To give it a frame of reference, it is similar to Brachetto or Frascati from Italy, but it's clumsy on the palate and tastes too much like red licorice and candied fruit to be taken too seriously. Also a bit cloying on the finish. Imported by National Distributing Co., Inc.
Made from Beckstoffer's portion of To Kalon, this is exceptionally rich and decadent. Cabs don't get much riper. Blasts off with black currants, cassis, chocolate fudge and exotic spices. But the wine is soft and the alcohol is quite high, making it almost sweet. Would benefit from being drier and more structured.
Not as complex as the Condé, this wine still has rich, plummy fruit matched with sexy oak. The oak shows as chocolate and vanilla on the nose.

The sourcing is Bien Nacido and the old Ashley's, two of the best vineyards in the county. The pedigree shows in the wine's balance and harmony, while the warm vintage is evident in the pie-filling fruit and spice flavors and a touch of funk. Probably at its best now and in the next few years.
The wine gives an impression of being supple and soft, at least on the nose, but you can feel the firm structure in the mouth. The quality of the tannins is dusty, firm and unyielding at this early stage. Drink in 5–10 years.
Hailing from high in the Pyrenees, this wine dances to the beat of its own drummer. Floral red-fruit aromas suggest hot stones and wild brush, accompanying leather and tomato scents on this blend of Bordeaux grapes. A tight, tannic palate is home to herbal plum and tea flavors. The wine is earthy tasting but a bit muddled on the finish.
This has been a consistent bottling from Wolff. The '06 shows classic Edna Valley acidity and very ripe, long hangtime fruit flavors of pineapples, Key limes, papayas and mangoes. It finishes with rich honey, but the wine is thoroughly dry.
This has strawberry aromas with a fresh, creamy texture and a light touch of tannin. The wine is warm, rounded and fruity, with a soft, smooth finish.

This is a super-intense wine that might not appeal to everyone. The aromas are wide reaching, immediate and recall almond Amaretto, candied orange, brown sugar and molasses. The wine is chewy and soft in the mouth and leaves strong marzipan flavors and a playful touch of sweetness.
A tremendous wine that easily held its own against Napa Cabs and blends, and a worthy followup to the wonderful 2006. Mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, with small amounts of Cabernet Franc and Merlot, the wine is extraordinarily rich and balanced and refined, showing Paso softness, but no absence of complexity. Really impresses for the depth and range of berries, currants, licorice, mocha, herbs, spices and oak. Now–2015.
A firmly tannic, young Pinot Noir with red berry fruits under this strong surface dryness. As it develops over the next year, it will become a more elegant, balanced wine, but never one with great power. Cécile is Willi Bründlmayer's daughter.
With light, tropical aromas of melon and mango combined with a juicy, clean palate, this is a good PG. Peach, nectarine, melon and papaya flavors finish with citrus notes. Drink this patio white as soon as possible.
Fragrances suggest white and yellow flowers, stone fruit, pear and a whiff of brioche. Displaying its 100% Chardonnay pedigree, the palate delivers Golden Delicious apple, white pear, citrus peel and notes of Mediterranean herb alongside bright acidity and a soft mousse.
Intense aromas of vanilla, smoked nuts and black cherry preserves seduce on the nose of this ripe, richly textured Pinot Noir. It's bold in fruit and oak tones, but penetrating tannins add gravitas to the finish.
Blackberry, earth and spice aromas prove that a bouquet can be complete with only a few ingredients. This feels rugged and tannic. Flavors of coconut, buttery oak and toast support berries fruit. This is choppy and pounds its way through the finish. Drink through 2021.
Tastes candy sweet, with cherry, raspberry, licorice, caramel and vanilla flavors. But the acidity and silky texture win points.
Tagaris makes two Rieslings, priced just a buck apart. The “Reserve” may be just a stitch tighter, with more creaminess in the mouth, less in-your-face fruit.
This is rich and full-bodied, a splendid wine with its ripe yellow fruits, intensely aromatic character and a pinch of pepper. Concentrated, it finishes with a light touch of toastiness that hints at the maturity to come. Drink from 2016.
Delicious sweet raisin and mulled wine fruit, full of herbs and nutmeg spice. This is a ripe wine, but too heavy, showing some austerity, but no sign of tiring.
Grapy candied berry aromas mix with loud oak that smells like clove and mint. This has a narrow astringent mouthfeel and strange-tasting berry flavors that end with a rugged finish.
Open, fresh and peachy on the nose, becoming citrusy and leaning toward the acidic side on the palate. Flavors of tangerine, lemon and orange keep it moving, and the finish, while short, is fresh and cleansing.
Right out of the bottle, this is tight, but airing coaxes out plenty of cherry, currant and tart persimmon flavors, with a pretty mouthfeel. Give this some time in the decanter to breathe and mellow.
As this wine shows, what marks out 2014 is the great fruitiness. This is full of rich black currants from a 60% Merlot and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon blend. A smoky background from tannins gives shape to the fruit and acidity. It will mature quickly; drink from late 2016. An Alliance Bourg member.
Plum and berry aromas are leathery but honest and not overreaching. The wine feels tight and pinched, while savory flavors of saucy plum and red-berry fruits finish lightly herbal, with a kick of tomato and spice along with leather.
This opens with aromas of acacia, toast and a whiff of honey. The linear palate offers golden apple, Mediterranean scrub and smoky hint of flint. A note of toasted hazelnut fills in the finish.
Rubrato is a clean and polished expression of Aglianico (stored in stainless steel instead of oak in order to preserve the freshness of the fruit) that would work with meatloaf or juicy cheeseburgers. It shows a smooth but firm quality in the mouth.
Impresses for the sheer volume of fruit, with explosive blackberry, cherry, cassis, chocolate, licorice, gingerbread, cola and smoky oak flavors. The structure is very fine, with rich, ripely smooth tannins and good acidity. Delicious now, and should remain so for several years.
Vanilla, honey, citrus and spice aromas lead this luscious white blend from Bellingham. On the palate, vanilla, lemon and creamy white fruit all mingle in a round, integrated character, but are spun with spice. A pretty, appealing white with something for everyone.
Winemaker Adam Lee notes that only two Oregon Pinots were made in 2011, as all fruit was declassified. Indeed, this is a thin, peppery wine, with highlights of orange peel and grapefruit, and just a short slice of red berry fruit.
This is a firmly structured wine that's powerful and rich. A dark, brooding quality powers the complex balance between fruit and tannins. It has the potential to be a beautiful, ripe, impressive wine with a strong sense of minerality. Drink from 2018.
Ripeness and a rich, phenolic edge dominate. Savory notes of lovage and an earthy undertone would make this a great companion for ripe, soft cheeses.
Touches of cinnamon and spice accent crisp red apples in this dry, medium-bodied rosé. The palate is tart but refreshingly brisk on the finish.
The Jaume family's regular bottling of 2011 Châteauneuf is a firm, sturdy effort. Dusty tannins frame notes of cherry, ash and espresso and come to a slightly chewy finish. Give it another year or two and then drink it up by 2020.
94-96 Barrel sample. A wine that opens slowly. Then the concentration and rich fruit come through. It gives a smooth texture over layers of toast, but never losing sight of freshness.
Almost, but not quite, undrinkable, this Zin is vegetal and dry, with asparagus-tinged flavors of berries.
91-93. Barrel sample. Blackberry fruits dominate this ripe wine. It is already delicious, with a round and well-cushioned structure.
Dusty, dry and lightly spiced aromas frame stalky red fruit scents. Feels chunky and clampy, with rooty berry sweetness and rubbery bitterness on the back palate and finish. Good, but tough around the edges.
A bit grassy and green, with good power, herbal black fruit aromas, spice and cola. The palate is very high in acidity, which at first creates a sheering sharpness and tart plum flavors. With more airing it grows rounder and more complex, but overall it's exacting, odd and funky.
A masterpiece—this is a true achievement. It is aged on its lees for seven months to achieve a rich, sophisticated mouthfeel, with long flavors of toasted bread, apricot and honey. The wine shows a slightly copperish or ramato color, with a dense creaminess on the finish.
Intensely ripe notes of black cherry and violet are highlighted by hints of ceder and mint in this forward but refreshingly brisk Cab. Dry on the palate, it's softly framed with a layer of fine, chalky tannins.
This is raisiny and soupy on the nose. A jammy, soft palate follows suit, while the flavors are pure prune and raisin. Stewy on the finish, this is overripe but still good. Drink soon.
Mulberry, cherry, iron, raw beef and roasted pork aromas make for a gamy entry to this bottling, which also shows bay leaf and sage on the nose. Those sagebrush qualities are strong on the palate, which is reminiscent of an Asian-spiced meat dish, with rhubarb and pomegranate lending freshness.
Great front label on this wine, a Rhône blend based on Syrah. It's dry, earthy and sharp in the mouth, with mint and cherry flavors.
For five bucks, you get a smooth, dry wine with nice cherry flavors and a polished edge of tannins. What's not to like?
There's a raw, fresh cherry element to the bouquet that is framed by white almond and pressed violets. The wine presents a thin, compact mouthfeel with Sangiovese's characteristic freshness on the close.
Steer clear of this one if you like your Sauvignons done in stainless. This one is 100% barrel fermented, yielding some toasty, smoky aromas that blend well with the forceful tropical fruit flavors. There's guava and pineapple, smoke and menthol on the long finish.
This wine hails from two fine vineyard sources belonging to the Dutton family—Mill Station Vineyard and Shop Bloc—within the Green Valley AVA embedded within the boundaries of the Russian River. Dry and extracted, it exudes honeysuckle and jasmine around lush layers of lemon, ginger candy and melon.
This is a black, velvety soft, dense wine. It is dry, with interesting plum, blackberry, leather and cocoa flavors. It's not very concentrated, but offers pleasure.
With considerable depth of flavor, this is a rounded, smooth wine. Its green apple flavor is laced with notes of pink grapefruit, crisp pear and a touch of peppered kiwi. It's ready to drink but also worth aging for a few months. Screwcap.
Dark, smoky black-fruit aromas include graphite. This is round, chewy and balanced on the palate, with ripe but standard flavors of cassis, blackberry and black pepper. Notes of burnt toast and char appear on a solid, ripe finish.
This medium-bodied, middle-of-the-road wine has some leafy notes that add complexity to straightforward passion-fruit aromas and flavors, which fade quickly on the finish.
Soft and fruity in the modern style, this Grenache has appealing red cherry and mocha flavors dusted with cinnamon and vanilla. It finishes sweet, like a Starbucks drink.
90–92. Barrel Sample. An herbaceous wine with lively acidity, green plum and grapefruit flavors. It's a Sauvignon Blanc driven wine, showing great freshness rounded out with a touch of tropical fruits.
The vines behind this wine were planted in the 1960s and 1970s, qualifying them as old in the Napa Valley. Winemaker Lisa Warner uses native yeast as well as one from Montrachet to craft this muted, nutty Chardonnay. Richly textured it is otherwise awash in high-toned citrus, both lemon and pineapple.
This full-bodied white opens with a delicate fragrance of pressed white flower, citrus zest, dried apricot and a balsamic note. The round palate delivers lemon drop, yellow peach, tangerine and a touch of vanilla alongside fresh acidity. It closes with an almond accent.
A crisp, fruity blend of Touriga Nacional and Aragonez, this wine is bright and light. Its refreshing acidity and red-currant fruits are delicious to drink now.
Lean and tautly balanced, this wine has an outdoorsy, mineral-and-hay bouquet and sweet herbal accents. Green apple flavors take over the palate, though hints of lemon and minerals also show up. Tasters didn't find anything terribly wrong here, just a lack of element that would make it more right. Finishes with lingering oaky notes.
Made using fruit that was sourced from vines planted in 1939, this wine shows the great concentration low yields and old vines can give. It has Gamay's natural freshness, with firm, dry tannins, a spice note and a fragrant finish. It's drinkable now, but it will be better in two years.
Made from the winery's little vineyard on Atlas Peak, this 100% Cabernet needs time to come around. It doesn't show the voluptuous approachability of the 2005 or the 2007, which will be released next year. It's fairly acidic and tannic. But there's a luscious core of blackberries and black currants. Try after 2012; it might be a very long-lived wine.
This is a fun wine, with flavors like cherry candy and milk chocolate. Light and insubstantial, but it will be quite nice chilled as an apéritif.
This definitely fits the bill as an affordable weekday red. Red berries, vanilla and spice on the nose and palate offer plenty of enjoyment, while there's just enough softly dusty tannins to provide structure on the crisp finish. Drink now through the end of 2018.
Done in an Australian Shiraz style, like the McCrea Boushey Grande Cote. It's big, lush and ripe (14.6% alcohol) and fashioned in a surefire, consumer-pleasing style. Lush, sweet fruit brings on the heat in the finish, but what flavor!
The only thing that makes this a gran reserva is the label and the winery's commitment to a big, extracted, heavily oaked wine. It's black as ink but clumsy as can be. Smells and tastes like shoe polish, resin and oily fruit. Not what we're looking for from Argentina, or anywhere for that matter. Barely acceptable. Imported by Carolina Wine Brands USA.
A delicious Chardonnay and Pinot Noir blend from coolly grown Mendocino grapes that is equal parts golden apple and honey in both aroma and flavor. Creamy from full malolactic fermentation, this sparkler is full-bodied and plenty fruity with a caramel, vanilla tone on the finish. Will pair well with creamy, full-bodied foods.
This is a distinctive white blend (with Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Verduzzo and Vermentino) with slightly oxidized aromas of almond, honey and mature apricot. There are both mineral and herbal qualities that help bring it back into line. The wine ends with a subtle touch of sweetness.
Here's a lusty, full-throttle wine that's marked by strong flavors of black pepper, blackstrap molasses, blackberry jam and creamy dark chocolate. High alcohol gives it a touch of heat and glyceriney sweetness.
One of the strengths of cool Beira Interior is that it produces powerful wines without the attendant alcohol of warmer climates. That's apparent with this intense, dark wine. Blending Touriga Nacional and Tinta Roriz, the dense and brooding wine with its rich blackberry fruitiness alongside dry, mineral tannins is a study in concentration and needs to age. Drink from 2018.
This blend of 35% Merlot, 35% Cabernet Sauvignon and 30% Petite Sirah is actually a party of three, but the results are solid. Chocolate, black cherries, scarlet rose buds and toasted oak pop on the nose. The smooth and dense palate shows boysenberry, black pepper and a chalky tannic structure.
This splendid, resonant, beautifully detailed wine captures everything that is most desirable in the 2014 vintage. Blackberry and black cherry fruit, adorned with a sprinkling of Sumatra coffee beans, rocks on with polished tannins. The pleasing roasted character is just right to power it through a clean, sexy finish. Drink now and on through 2026.
Restraint on the nose yields into biscuity, strawberry-tinged roundedness on the palate, with pleasant length. Fresh acidity lends focus while fine, persistent mousse and gentle autolytic hints speak of elegance. This is a light but classy apéritif that would make a wonderfully unburdened start to a special evening.
Lychee and melon aromas are proper for Torrontés. And while this has Viognier and Chardonnay in the blend, it's Torrontés that dominates via a spritzy, citrusy mouthfeel and flavors of lychee, nectarine and citrus fruits. A fresh, lively but simple finish confirms the wine's refreshment potential.
Minty, herbal and slightly grassy on the nose, and of course there's berry fruit to boot. The palate has normal feel and balance, with regular red fruit flavors from the currant and cherry family. Lengthy on the finish, but overall it's as basic as they come.
Aromas of hot pepper flakes, Chinese mustard, leather and red plum are all over the map. The palate is a bit tart and tangy for Malbec, with mid-level berry flavors and a shot of tartness. Not overly ripe or happy, but with touches of quality.
The wine is a field blend of a mix of grape varieties planted at random in the old Douro tradition. It is both structured and fruity, allowing a splendid range of perfumes to come from the glass. Ripe and full-bodied, with a touch of wood-aging, it has a medicinal edge as well as layers of black fruitiness. It needs to age, so drink from 2016.
A blend of 41% Grenache, 37% Syrah, 14% Mourvèdre, 4% Counoise and 4% Cinsault from seven vineyards, this longtime Margerum-fan favorite shows boisterous wild berries, allspice-laced brioche, juicy hibiscus and fresh watermelon notes on the fun, inviting nose. It's juicy, light and easy drinking, with hints of anise and dried mint that give character to the bright red fruit.
Mike Januik calls 2008 the most perfect harvest weather in his 25 years working in the Columbia Valley. This sleek and beautifully proportioned wine has deep black cherry fruit, with smoky espresso flavors and moderately thick tannins. Substantial yet with appealing purity, it's a perfect steak wine and also one to stick in the cellar for a decade or so.
A blend of 70% Nero d'Avola and 30% Syrah, this straightforward, full-bodied wine opens with aromas of toast, dark spice, and ripe black-skinned fruit. The chewy palate doles out ripe blackberry, smoke, licorice and ground pepper framed in fine-grained tannins.
This blend of premier crus and some village Côte de Beaune shows generous red-cherry fruit and a touch of acidity. Its depth of richness and complexity highlight its fine origins.
Despite incredible levels of ripeness—evidenced by notes of chocolate and dried fruit—this wine features a bit of garrigue on the nose and licorice flavors on the palate, which together impart a sense of freshness. Full bodied and richly textured, it ends in a silky dusting of cocoa powder-like tannins. Drink now–2020.
Starts out smelling sulfury, and slow to burn off. Then turns jammy sweet in the mouth, with sugary flavors of pineapples, green apples, honeysuckle and vanilla.
50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Merlot and 10% Grenache make this a flavorful and well structured Vin de Pays from the south of France. Fleshy in the mouth with ripe tannins, notes of black plum, blackberry, fennel and a hint of green pepper lead into the solid finish.
This is pure single-vineyard Syrah, dark and tasting of cassis and blackberry, with a slightly briny, oyster-shell undercurrent. As it breathes, it displays a cured meat flavor, with a lively, citrusy finish accented by espresso.
The Kressmann family produces a classic white at its Martillac estate. It is powered with fresh apples and cream flavors. A delicate layer of wood gives a fine lift to this Sauvignon Blanc-dominated the blend. There is a streak of minerality the wine more than just deliciously fruity.
Aromas of raspberry and baking spices are followed by tart, full-bodied fruit flavors backed by cranberry-like tartness. It shows a lovely sense of texture but the alcohol distracts.
Light in color with an herbal profile, this lightly textured wine offers tart cherry and dry tannins with a bite of oak on the finish. Having undergone partial whole-cluster fermentation (30%), it also has a forested, savory character, streaked in cedar and baking spice. Most of the grapes hail from Sonoma Mountain, rounded out by Sonoma Coast, Russian River Valley and Mendocino fruit.
Made in a supple, immediately approachable style, this is a nicely supple, slightly creamy, almost gulpable red. Raspberry and cherry fruit is buttressed by ample spice, then ends on a lingering note of star anise. Drink now–2018.
Pretty, in a ballet dancer style, with an underlying strength that belies the apparent delicacy. Classic, peachy and delicious.
Juicy and fresh, this deeply colored wine offers lots of grapey, berry-like aromas and equally fruity and vivid flavors. It has a touch of sweetness and a soothing, smooth texture. The name refers to the winery's pledge to give 100% of profits to charity.
Much the same blend as Rulo's Syrca (64% Cabernet Sauvignon, 36% Syrah), this is softer and a bit further along the path to maturity, as it is nonvintage. The berry fruit is annotated with sleek streaks of graphite, toast and tobacco. It's just a bit chalky, so pair it with a fatty, juicy steak.
Rich, loamy and ripe smelling, this wine opens in fine form, with accents of raisin, cassis and ink. The mouthfeel is deep and balanced, while flavors of toasty blackberry, cassis and chocolate are ripe and modern. Finishing notes of coffee, licorice, blackened toast and pepper bring a dark side to this long-lasting, deeply etched Malbec. Drink through 2018.
Tough and chewy. Nonetheless there's a wealth of rich cherry pie, red currant and cedar flavor, and the mouthfeel is pure silk. A curiosity. May develop in the bottle, but probably best before 2013.
Pale salmon colored, this is a fairly aromatic rosé with notes of strawberry, bubblegum and cherry. It's off-dry, leaning toward medium sweet and needs a bit more acidity to stand it up.
Dominated by Grenache, Magni's 2009 Sensation displays distinctive notes of pie cherry, stewed rhubarb, watermelon and cracked pepper. Medium to full in the mouth, it boasts exceptionally silky tannins. Tart and peppery on the finish but not at all unpleasant.
95-97 Barrel sample. A super-rich wine, but one that has managed to retain a superb balance. It is powerful, dense and concentrated, but there is also complexity from the wonderful juicy fruits.
A nice Cabernet for drinking now. It's rich in berries, cherries, currants and oak, with smooth tannins and soft acidity. Shows an elaboration that makes it upscale and elegant.
Offers a smooth, creamy mouthfeel and a red plum-fruit core, with caramel and tobacco accents. Aromas are of figs and Indian spices; one reviewer found the fruit a bit candied. This is a very good Cab, drinkable in the near term, though not one that necessarily merits such a lofty price tag. Finishes with bitter chocolate.
Ripe, sweet-fruited wine, its red berry fruits and opulent tannins giving a rounded feel. There is, as well, a good structure composed of acidity, licorice and wood. It needs 2–3 years still to really develop all its depth of flavor.
This Chianti Classico Riserva is a balanced and intense wine with beautiful aromas of dark fruit, sweet spice, chocolate fudge, espresso bean and pipe tobacco. That bright Sangiovese freshness pops in on the finish.
Aromas of coffee, dried herbs, vanilla, flowers and cherry lead to ripe, full-bodied fruit flavors. The silky feel and lengthy finish only adds to the enjoyment.
Jasmine, apricot and floral aromas are followed by medium-sweet stone-fruit flavors. Floral and jasmine flavors persist on the finish.
The aromas suggest key lime pie topped with whipped cream and a sprinkling of white chocolate, but itÕs surprisingly soft and featureless in the mouth. There are peach flavors, but ultrasoft acidity turns them syrupy. An aggressive overlay of oak only adds vanilla. Seems like an afterthought by the winemaker.
Baked plum, fragrant blue flower, dried herb, eucalyptus and cake spice aromas unfold on this full-bodied red. The elegant, structured palate offers mature black cherry, licorice, mocha and grilled herb while firm, fine-grained tannins provide the framework. This shows more aging potential than many of the 2011s. Drink 2019–2031.
Vaillons is on the left bank of Serein river across from the slope of Grand Cru vineyards. This wine, made from organically grown grapes, is ripe while also having a tense, steely texture that will allow it to develop for several years. Apple and pink-grapefruit flavors are lifted by nervy acidity. Drink from 2018.
Inviting berry and dark plum aromas are matched by spice notes and depth. The palate feels ripe and full, maybe a touch scratchy, with generous flavors of berry fruits, licorice and toast. For a value wine this shows intensity and good flavors.
This captures the spicy vitality of Les Collines Merlot, with pretty cherry and plum fruit set against a smattering of new oak toast. It's a clean, well-defined wine that continues into a tasty finish with highlights of roasted walnuts and clove.
Big but scattered. The nose mixes incongruent aromas of green beans, chocolate and wood resin before transitioning to a palate of wood spice and generic berry fruit flavors. Too chewy, resiny and woody, and lacking harmony.
Riserva Le Balze di Montefioralle opens with a touch of spice and natural rubber that is enhanced by warm tones of smoked bacon and sliced prosciutto. The close is thin and slightly bitter.
A blend of half-and-half Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a solid wine. The tannins are still quite dominant although they are ripe and will integrate well into the red and black berry fruits. Acidity at the end keeps the wine fresh and fruity. Drink from 2017.
An aromatic wine, it has notes of tangerine and mineral. It drinks medium sweet (10 g/L residual sugar), with the sugar getting just a bit out in front of the acids.
Spaghetti con vongole (clams) is an appropriate pairing partner for this luminous white wine from northern Italy. Aged only in stainless steel, this Soave Classico delivers clean aromas of peach, citrus and honey.
This stylish Merlot-based wine has juicy red-berry flavors that are sustained by acidity and firmed up by tannins. Still dry from its dense structure, it's developing well. Drink from 2018.
Not a success. The wine has a rustic feeling, and is so soft, it makes the cola and cherry flavors taste syrupy. Lacks life and vivacity.
It's all about sweet, delicious flavor in this 100% Cabernet. Dazzles the mouth with the essence of blackberries, cassis, cherry tart with the smoky crust, chocolate and exotic sandalwood, wrapped into the richest, finest tannins you can imagine. Compulsively drinkable, if a little too forward with its charms. Now–2013.
A subtle, elegant nose displays cassis, soy, vanilla and green bean aromas. Many of Groot Constantia's wines, including this one, have a silky mouthfeel, with just the right amount of oak balancing the soft tannins and acidity. Mixed berry, bell pepper and tobacco flavors continue through a decently long finish.
Fresh, bright and super lively on the palate, this very attractive Prosecco Superiore would pair with bite-sized quiche with cheese and ham or mini-pizza appetizers. Citrus and green melon are backed by acidity and tight, steely perlage.
This is a smooth, thick and tannic wine that's full-bodied, robust and priced to sell. Cassis and blackberry both figure into the mix, along with a finish of tobacco and vanilla.
Wan in color, with vanilla and pear aromas that aren't too fresh, this is a syrupy, sweet, flabby Chardonnay. Soft flavors of pear and pineapple are overdone.
This wine's wild berry, violet, porcini, forest floor and crushed herb aromas leap out of the glass. The vibrant, focused palate evokes wild cherry, cranberry, star anise and orange zest. It's a classic Barbera framed by firm acidity and refined tannins that shows its Nizza origins.
Pipe tobacco, raspberry reduction and a sweet sagebrush character promise an interesting experience. Once sipped, the overwhelmingly sweet cherry, cough-syrup flavor pushes this wine beyond a dry, and the typical Cabernet Franc herbs that emerge in the midpalate don't overwhelm its cloying nature. Good for dessert, by itself.
After all the soft red wines lately, it's almost a relief to gag on some real tannins. Dry and spicy, with big-time black cherry pie flavors, complete with the baked, buttery crust.
Lightweight but round, this Merlot is missing a bit of lushness to its dark fruit core, with more skin-driven flavors of cherry and plum.
Here's a creamy, foamy Prosecco with pretty peach nuances backed by mature pear and Golden Delicious apple. The wine has an extremely smooth texture with a bright, zesty close and lingering floral notes.
A Western Australia offshoot of the Yalumba empire, Ringbolt's 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon offers solid quality at a reasonable price. It's medium-bodied and elegant, with prominent herbal notes balanced by cassis and chocolate. Long on the finish, where dried spice and vanilla notes emerge. Drink now–2012.
Full bodied and definitely fruity without being sweet, this wine from Fulcrum comes straight at the taste buds with opulent black cherry and tart raspberry flavors on a vivid texture. Having spent 15 months in French oak before bottling, it tastes a bit dense and muted at this point, and should be best after 2018.
Made with the little-known Marzemino grape, this medium-bodied wine delivers fresh acidity and lively aromas of wild berries, raspberry, cherry and white almond. The wine would pair nicely with vegetable risotto.
Still dependable despite changes in ownership, this winery again delivers an elegant, well-made wine. With this vintage, it veers more toward herbaceous notes than fruity ones. The dominant flavors are of green olives and sweet bell pepper. Don't think, however, that it's lean. Oak provides fatness, and the right foods, like grilled red meat, will coax out the berry sweetness.
A touch blossomy against a core of ripe raspberry and cherry perfume, the nose on this traditional-method Pinot Noir sparkler is particularly alluring. The palate is elegant and fresh, marked by fine, mouthfilling mousse and delicate raspberry-candy finish.
Leafy red-berry aromas come with a note of olive. This wine feels lean and searing, with edgy tannins and high acidity. Spicy flavors of herbal plum and tomato finish with a dusting of baking spices.
A brilliant shade of purplish-pink, this bottling is quite light on the nose, with hints of hibiscus and raspberry. The flavors are crisp and easy, with tart strawberry, light nectarine and subtle cranberry juice.
A well-crafted, finely balanced Pinot Noir, Deep Cove is a blend of estate and nonestate fruit. It's properly Pinot-silky in texture, and features a nice mix of assertive fruit and subtle complexity, ranging from black cherries to mushroomy earthiness. Drink now–2013.
Grassy on the nose, then foamy and abrasive on the tongue, with a mix of oxidized flavors, bitter citrus and grassy accents. It finishes pithy tasting and citrusy.
Hints of wild game and ceder lend rusticity to tart red-currant notes on this elegant Cabernet Franc. It's delicate in body but densely concentrated in red cherry and cassis flavors that penetrate. Finishes boldly with a mouth-filling fringe of tannins.
RWT (unromantically derived from “Red Wine Trial”) is 100% Barossa Valley Shiraz, aged in 100% French oak. In some vintages, like this one, the combination is incredibly sumptuous, offering layers of blueberry and blackberry fruit intermingled elegantly with hints of French vanilla. It's long, subtle and complex on the finish—a stunning effort. It's approachable now, but should age well through 2030 or so.
Syrah seems to be the new signature grape at Montes, and this high-end example rocks due to round, roasted aromas of earth, coffee and black fruit as well as blackberry, plum and clove flavors. A firm, deep wine with a lot going on. For Chilean Syrah it's quite the mover and shaker.
This has ripe, rewarding blackberry, cherry and oak flavors, wrapped in full-bodied tannins and finished with sweet oak. It's easy to drink with any beef or lamb dish.
Yeasty, honeyed aromas are unfocused. This shows a combination of chunky weight and citric acidity on the palate along with oak-heavy flavors led by clove. Bland peach and apple flavors don't stand up to the wine's oak character.
This winery's '03 1886 reserve-style Cab was a monster, and this Cab, though smaller, treads the same waters. It's a ripe, balanced wine that shows a wealth of Cabernet flavors that turn sweet on the finish.
Hafner has been a pioneer of Austrian ice wine. Not every one in their considerable range of ice wines work. This one does. It has just that right piercing acidity to give a heart-stopping lift to the sweetness of the wine. The sweet pineapple and peach flavors add extra richness.
Lemon, lime and straw aromas are fresh but also a little stalky. Spritz and then an oily afternote define the feel, while flavors of white fruits taste pithy and a touch green and herbaceous.
Huge, ripe flavors of blackberry and plum jam, mocha, black currants, anise and cedar mark this wine, grown in the rugged hills of southern Monterey County. It's quite tannic and dry, but doesn't seem to be an ager, so drink up.
Sweet oak shadings are lavished over a solid core of cherry and black currant in this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot. Dig deeper and you'll encounter exotic spice, tobacco, sweet red fruit, natural rubber and chocolate yogurt. It boasts chewy, tart tannins over long-lasting cherry flavors.
This blend of Sangiovese, Sagrantino and Montepulciano has aromas of toasted oak, mocha and blackberry preserves. The dense palate offers dried black cherry, fig, espresso, toast and clove alongside chewy, drying tannins. You'll also detect the presence of alcohol on the midpalate.
Though labeled simply “Oregon,” this is 100% Hyland vineyard fruit from the McMinnville AVA. Done in a refined, lightly smoky style, it pushes subtle berry flavors into a substantial midpalate laden with highlights of milk chocolate, café crème and a touch of caramel. Smooth as silk, this will be tough to ignore in your cellar, though it will reward another three to five years of bottle age.
Clean and crisp aromas of Gravenstein apples, Bartlett pear and key lime pith meet with a slight hint of smoke wafting in the background on this bottling by onetime wunderkind Gavin Chanin. The sizzling acidity presents delicate flavors of nectarine, peach and mango, with a touch of butter toward the finish. The wine steadily improves days after opening. Enjoy now through 2025.
Golden honey, tangerines and orange blossoms perfume this silky smooth late harvest Riesling. Lush stone fruit and honey flavors melt onto the palate, but are anchored by an elegant black tea note and a bright tangerine acidity that make this sweet ambrosia a delightfully long sip.
A wonderful Cabernet, rich and complex, that advances the cause of this inland Santa Barbara Valley for Bordeaux varieties. Tasted against fine Cabs from Napa Valley, it did just fine, with intricate blackberry, cassis and currant flavors. Work needs to be done on the tannins, to give them greater definition, although it's hard to tell if that's a function of the grapes or the barrels.
Woodspice and vanillin are out in front on the aromas followed by mocha, raspberry and dark fruit. The palate brings lush, concentrated flavors and a lingering finish. It drinks beautifully now sbut should have a long life ahead of it.
Smooth and integrated but punctuated by spicy oak and plum flavors, this Texas Merlot is a welcome surprise. It starts with aromas of savory meats, smoke and pepper and ends with a lingering finish. A food-friendly wine that's not overly complex, but enjoyable.
Streaks of lime and tart green apple lend an acidic edge to this light-bodied Pinot Grigio. Dry in style, its concentrated palate suggests savory apple and pear edged with earth and bramble.
Crisp, apple-flavored and touched by citrus, this is light and toasty. The finish is dry, fruity and fresh. Ready to drink.
Pinot Bianco is a fantastic food wine that delivers good density and natural creaminess without being too fragrant or perfumed. This beautiful expression delivers the best that this grape variety awards in an exceedingly crisp and clean package.
From the oldest part of the estate, this subtle wine rewards your patience and full attention. Hints of rose petals adorn the floral accents, while the midpalate emphasizes flavors of raspberries and orange peel.

). You'll want to cellar this young 100% Cab because it's not showing its full potential yet. Dry and tannic, it's very rich in black currants and blackberry jam, but all of the wine's parts need more time to fully integrate; currently, the oak is forward, the acids are tart and citrusy, and the tannins are fierce. Should improve over the next 10 years, maybe even 20.
Here's a beautifully well-balanced but easy Nero d'Avola that does a very good job of expressing the natural flavors of this native Sicilian grape. The wine's aromas include roasted almond, pistachio and black currant. It delivers power and strength that are both valuable assets if you plan to drink it with stews or roasted meat.

94-96 Barrel sample. Full of blackcurrant fruits, ripe and sweet tannins and forward fruit. The wine feels polished, ripe, smooth.

Still one of the standards for a clean, crisp Assytriko. The Boutari offers citrus and minerals in the nose, and a clean, zippy snap of fresh fruit and sea salt on the palate. Light, elegant and delightful, and fantastic with fresh fish, fruit and salads.

Rustic and simple, with a sharpness and modest berry flavors. Okay with fast food.

The nose is attractive and offers aromas of blackberry, tree bark, herbs and minerality. The palate deals gritty tannins and rich, raisiny flavors of cassis, blackberry, coffee and toast. This finishes a touch choppy and rough, with weight and power. Drink through 2016.

Dark, extracted and woody almost to an extreme, this opens with resiny aromas of raw oak, coconut, vanilla and prune. A palate with pinching, hard tannins is fierce, with heavily oaked flavors of roasted blackberry feeding into a finish with dominant woodspice and resin flavors. Drink through 2020.

This fruity fizz majors on the aroma of freshly cut Golden Delicious apples, while the body is very light, slightly tart and pleasantly dry. The mousse is rather frothy but if refreshment is what you are after, this is your ticket.

Formely known as Winemaker's Selection, this base-level Malbec is ultra purple and dark, with gritty, grapey aromas that are big but not all that well formed. The palate is heavy and tannic, with juicy, semi-green flavors of blackberry and boysenberry. Has power, color and size but not all the parts fit.
A well-structured wine, with tannins marching in step with the red fruits and fresh acidity. With its dark color and mineral character, this is firm and solid, giving way to a lighter touch with the bright juicy aftertaste. Screwcap.

Sweet in fruity oak and soft in structure, this easy wine has flavors of red cherries, raspberries, red currants and vanilla honey. Drink now.
Giribaldi's Barbaresco is smoky and warm with layered tones of exotic spice, cola, leather, tobacco and leftover espresso grinds.

Soft and simple, this is seemingly sweet and easy to drink now for its wealth of raspberry, cherry, mocha and spice flavors. The texture is light and silky. A portion of the profits goes to trout and salmon watershed restoration efforts.
This is among the best deals out of Santa Barbara County each vintage. A blend of 47% Grenache, 26% Mourvèdre, 15% Cinsault and 12% Counoise, it offers rose petal, anise, lilac and lavender on the nose. There's an elegant lightness on the palate, where vibrant wild raspberry, red plum and potpourri spice flavors shine.
This 100% Petite Sirah is very, very sweet. When the palate experiences this much concentrated brown sugar and caramel, it exults. The problem is that sweetness is pretty much all there is. You'll find blackberry jam and chocolate.
Always a good blend, the '05 Kuyen seizes on raspberry, cassis and oaky richness and brings everything together in a well-wrapped package. The palate is bright, focused and full of cherry and raspberry, while the finish is lengthy and stout. A flavorful and satisfying red wine with a robust personality.

A typically snappy opening with the pop of jalapeño gives way to a laser-sharp palate with bold acidity. Tart, mouthwatering citrus flavors come with green, herbal notes. This is cleansing and bone dry on the finish, but always a touch vegetal.
A tough wine to like right now. It's tightly wound and hard in tannins and bone dry, which is the winery's house style. These are grapes that were picked early, before they shriveled. The flavors veer between blackberries and currants to anise and pepper. The gamble is in the cellar. Try after 2013.
This amber-colored Riserva offers slightly oxidized flavors of caramel, butterscotch and yellow rose. There are Sherry notes in there too, but not enough of them to disregard the wine. It shows good length and persistency.
Pretty tannic for a Merlot. It's a dusty, super-dry, tight young wine with a fair amount of astringency. But the fruit is something else. The huge cherry pie and toasty, vanilla oak flavors are just delicious. Hard to tell if it will soften before the fruit drops out, though.
This wine is toasty and rich upfront, with decadent aromas of cedar-grilled apple and peach pit that are graced with hints of garribue and gardenia.

The palate is standard in a good way, with more pepper plus blackberry fruit, roasted beef and rosemary-crusted lamb notes, framed by proper tannins and acidity.
Here is a concentrated wine that has dense tannins and acidity. Black currant freshness offers lively pleasure already, but should intensify in fruitiness in two years.

A very pretty Viognier from a small estate producer in Mendocino, this wine is 100% Viognier with no oak and no malolactic fermentation employed. Medium to almost full-bodied, it has impressive texture, plush flavors of honeydew and honey and a slightly sweet finish.
Red dusty berry cobbler marks the entry to this estate wine co-fermented with 2% Petite Sirah. Milk chocolate, nutmeg and clove play supporting roles in this otherwise bright, food-friendly wine with measured oak impact.
Sharp red-fruit aromas include notes of vinegar and asphalt. Angular and bumpy on the palate, this is tart and foxy tasting, with a sour, herbal finish.
A blend of two clones (MV6 and 114), this is a floral wine that blends ripe cherries with more savory notes of mushroom and smoke. The oak is wonderfully understated, which allows the fruit complexity to shine and leaves the fruit tannins to glide easily across the palate. Drink now–2025.

This is a solid wine, chunky in a typical way for the appellation with plenty of black fruits and balanced tannins. Drink from 2017.
This drinkable Pinot does have a tannic toughness. On the palate, there are good notes of cherry and cola, but hints of green unripeness compromise its future. Give it a good decant and drink now.
Even among value-priced Cabs from Chile, this one isn't offering much. The nose is sharp and brambly, with a hint of stem that takes a while to loosen its grip. The palate is made up of bitter-tinged raspberry flavors and short, choppy tannins. Seems more short on substance than in the past.
From a label owned by former L.A. Laker Sasha Vujacic, this Merlot-dominant wine delivers aromas of bricks, dust, black cherries, dried oregano and cedar, the sense of ripe but serious fruit lingering in the background. The energetic, grippy palate is reminiscent of Vietnamese coffee—creamy yet properly bitter, rich and flavorful—with blueberry and tart blackberry fruit proving lush and welcoming.
The old vine designation, though unregulated, is usually reserved for plantings at least a quarter century old. Though the first sniff suggests a wine that has been over-oaked, such is not the case. It has the concentration and fruit power—layers of citrus and stone fruit flavors—along with the depth and texture that older vines bring, to more than support the generous new oak.
Red berry, green herb and tobacco are the lead aromas on this Cabernet-Syrah blend. Feels grabby but structured, with a big, loud mix of ripe berry, plum, subtle spice and earth. Rounds out and unfolds on the finish.

This variety is a consistent strength for this winery. A warm vintage wine, it offers aromatic notes of freshly cut flowers, peach, creamsicle, pear and tangerine. It's textured in feel with abundant stone fruit and vanilla flavors that lead to a tart, apricot filled finish that lingers. The barrel influences play a big part but it works.
Deliciously crisp, this is a light and lively blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir. With its raspberry and red apple flavors, it exudes fruitiness, with an attractively soft finish.
Oak stars in this Chard—too much oak, in fact. Vanilla, char, wood sap, woody spice and smoke tastes dominate the tropical fruit, peach and citrus flavors.
Hugely spicy this rich wine is described as sweet. In fact, the spice gives it a drier edge, adding pepper and cinnamon as well as a mineral character from the granite soil. The wine could age, so drink from 2016.

Michele Chiarlo's Cerequio is one of the important wines that defines Barolo, past and present. This historic bottle offers consistency and longevity thanks to its aromas of spice, cola, red fruit, cigar box and licorice. In keeping with Nebbiolo tradition, it offers a tight, streamlined feel.
Apple, pear and some mint on the nose stir interest, and the palate delivers more of the same. The orange flavors are tangy, while the finish is simple and direct. Imported by American Wine Distributors.
Tropical fruit and tangy lemon aromas and flavors are nearly buried under dense oak here, but when they peek through they are bright and pleasing. The acids are sharp, but in here they seem to help the fruit cut through the wood veneer. Good, but a lighter hand letting the fruit shine more would be even better.
Potent and alive, kind of rubbery and leathery, with a shot of barnyard thrown in for good measure. Shows solid cherry and berry at the core, but that fruit is offset by hard tannins and overt firmness. Not a lush, modern playboy; more of classic with old-world appeal. Needs time in the glass to unravel.
From a little-known region of Western Australia, this is a restrained, structured example of Chardonnay that may drink well for 5–6 years. Subtle vanilla and bacon shadings upfront add nuance to the melon and pear aromas. Flavors are of soft, fully ripe tree fruit and melon, but held in check by citrusy notes and crisp acids.
Subtle floral aromas and whiffs of tropical fruit lead to a lean palate that offers peach, papaya and mango alongside bright acidity. Pair it with lightly seasoned seafood dishes.
This is a very nice Cabernet that feels rich in the mouth, a wine that will have everybody remarking on its smooth, velvety texture.

The Grand Reserve blend, which is 80% Cabernet Sauvignon and lesser parts Carmenère and Petit Verdot, is clearly Simone's best wine. With the '06 vintage, plum and cassis aromas pick up purity with airing, and the palate shows nice raspberry, cassis and plum flavors. A focused wine that makes its mark.
This delicously crisp wine is light and full of fresh citrus and red fruits. It dances out of the glass, bright with acidity. The name says it all—it's ready to drink this instant.

This proprietary blend of Zinfandel, Syrah and Malbec satisfies, offering a crisp, creamy layering of strawberry and grapefruit atop a medium-sized body and salty, tangy finish.
Rustic, fruity stuff here, with bold fruity-spicy flavors. A galumphing wine that's big and boisterous; nothing shy about it. A bit rough-edged, it needs meat and pasta and similarly uncomplicated foods to tame it.
While there are considerable flavors of wood aging here, this creamy white is more concentrated on ripe plum and apricot fruits, with attractive acidity and forward fruitiness. It has weight and also a stylish feel to it.

Earthy and leafy aromas yield to tomato leaf and weighty plum aromas. The palate is full but sharp, with tart, driving pie cherry and herbal flavors. Stays rather hard on the finish, where more tomato rolls out.
This is an amazing Syrah. Few in the history of California have been this dramatically rich and ripe with flavors of blueberries, blackberries, chocolate, currants, cedar and baking spices. Yet the wine is thoroughly dry, and the alcohol feels balanced with a warm, soft mouthfeel. Delicious now and for the next 4–5 years.
Fruity and juicy, this showcases the accessibility of this estate, while also highlighting some of the tannic structure of its big brother, Léoville-Barton. There is a classic black-currant note that's balanced by the firm tannins of the vintage.
Herbal, peppery and high-toned, with hairspray notes that detract from the ample blackberry and plum flavors. Disappointing.

With both attractive black-currant fruits typical of the vintage and firm tannins with tight structure, drink this wine from 2020.
Delicacy and charm often seem to be the hallmarks of Angludet—positive virtues in a world full of alcoholic, powerful wines. This 2003 has perhaps more tannins than usual from small berries, but it retains the property's elegance. Can be drunk relatively young, but certainly improves over 5–10 years.
This wine's intense berry aromas are followed by equally deep flavors, as its meaty, earthy, spicy nuances develop with each sip. It has complexity, concentration, a very smooth texture and that certain wild element that's attractive in Syrah.
Organically cultivated vines, some over 80-years-old, on the upper terraces above the river Lot are behind this firmly structured, concentrated wine. With solid tannins as well as the potential of black fruits, it is young and certainly needs to age. Drink from 2020.

Aromas of blue flowers, blackberries and cake spices lead the nose on this smooth, structured wine. The palate delivers baked plums, prunes marinated in spirits, cinnamon, white pepper and tobacco alongside soft tannins. It has good length and closes on a chocolate note.
Explosively fruity but refined. Tastes of the quintessence of black cherries, with nuances of anise and mocha. Rich in tannins, but softly drinkable now, and exquisitely detailed. These grapes used to go into Opus One.

This is a full-bodied and rich wine with touches of vanilla and toast from wood aging that are integrated into flavors of ripe apricot, lime and herbs. Drink now, and until 2019.
The bouquet blends tropical aromas with popcorn, and the palate is toasty as well, but not cloying or thick. Flavors of green banana, orange, melon and pineapple are spicy and zesty, and there's pineapple and woodspice to the finish. A natural-yeast Chard with balance and zest to go along with tropical sweetness.
Last year's bottling was elegant and refined. This year, the Merlot-Cabernet Franc blend remains an extremely elegant wine, yet is even richer in chocolate-cherry flavor, drizzled with vanilla and cinnamon, and wickedly soft on the palate. Somehow, all this richness manages to stay dry.
Easy to like for its crisp, mouthwatering acidity and flavors of lemons and limes, figs and vanilla. A nice, everyday wine to drink with roast chicken or as a cocktail sipper.
Here's an affordable Bierzo red that earns big points for its straightforward, no-nonsense accessibility and balance.

There is lots of oak influence evident in this wine, with flavors of raspberry jam slathered on buttered, cinnamon-scented toast. It's also quite tart. Drink now.
This Riesling has extra levels of intensity and energy that set it apart from the crowd. Explosive aromas of fresh limes and honey burst from the glass, followed by peach and citrus flavors that drip with ripeness without getting heavy or ponderous. Long and concentrated on the finish.
This wine's bottle aging allows a confluence of layers to work in harmony. The nose shows dill, black pepper, wet slate, just-ripe black cherry and pencil shavings, while the palate stacks black raspberry and blackberry fruit up against dried sagebrush and graphite. It's rich, but with enough earth and tartness to achieve balance. Drink now.
Big and boisterous, as if you're sniffing a bed of coal, menthol and macerated black fruit. The palate is sun-drenched and juicy, but not what you'd call elevated. And the finish mixes savory flavors with tight tannins. A good red wine that bears little semblance to Old World Syrah.
Firm and with dark tannins, this wine has great potential. Ripe berry fruits and a concentrated structure are already well balanced with acidity cutting through. As it matures, this wine with its dense structure will develop well. Drink from 2017. Enologist Sebastien and vineyard manager Nicolas are the latest Carreau generation managing family estates.

Thin, crisp and short on the palate, this bright expression of Cortese offers a focused bouquet with tones of white flower, crushed stone and citrus. Try it with smoked salmon pâté on toasted bread.

Intense aromas of smoke and struck matches blow off with aeration, allowing pretty grapefruit, lime and lemongrass notes to come through. While a touch racy and light in body, it's a ripe richly fruity wine with subtle accents of earth, pine frond and lime pith.
Basic and a little sweet and confected, but consider the price and you should be smiling. There's some bramble and pepper to the nose, but mostly it's just ripe and full of blackberry and black plum character. Candied and almost cloying, but remains flush and happy. Good in the midlevel category.
Buttered hazelnuts lead the flavor charge, followed by full, rich fruit that's creamy and marked by lees contact rather than primary fruit. The finish picks up dried-spice flavors of cinnamon and clove.

Peach, nectarine and green pear aromas and flavors dominate this ripe-styled Verdejo-Viura blend. Typical of Rueda, it's citrusy and a zesty, but there's enough warmth and heft so that you wouldn't call it steely or stark. Drink now.
This dazzling wine—86% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Cabernet Franc, 3% Malbec, and 1% Petit Verdot aged in 40% new French oak—offers notes of blackberry, black currant, olive and anise. It's rich and flavorful yet understated with a supple feel and bright acidity. Firm tannins provide the core and a long finish. Just a baby now, this wine should offer drinking pleasure through 2030 or longer.

An excellent wine, and one that  will certainly age well. Imported by Henry Wine Group.

A superb wine, fresh and ripe, with a characteristic edge of caramel, opulence and bone-dry acidity. This comes from a great vineyard in a great Loire year, so it's no surprise that, like many great Loire Chenin Blanc, it promises lengthy aging—15–20 years if you can wait. In the meantime, now it has youthful vigor and freshness. Screwcap. Available in the U.S. from January 2008.

Crisp, bright and laden with a patchwork of flavors: ripe apples, pears and stone fruit against a backdrop of earthy minerality. Broad yet only medium bodied, with a moderately long finish.
You can call this wine country-style because it's a simple little Zin, but it has a certain charm. Drink it with a nice pizza or meatball hoagie and enjoy the black raspberry and pepper flavors.
An extraordinarily elegant wine that will satisfy diehard Burgundians as well as fans of sweeter, riper Pinot Noir. It's generous in cherries, raspberries, chocolate and smoky sandalwood, yet shows a mushroomy earthiness that adds rich complexity. It will not be surprising if this delicious wine ages well for at least six years.
The basic aromas of grapefruit, green herbs and stone fruits are generic. This feels young, fresh and fruity, with flavors of lime and grapefruit that end in standard fashion.
Mauro Veglio's estate is a small, family run affair that turns out excellent results year after year. A deep understanding of the Nebbiolo grape results in wines that are distinguished by signature aromas of wild berries, mesquite, white truffle and fragrant cedar. Tight tannins feel polished and dry in the mouth and this Barolo should age nicely for many more years.
Hints of white blossom and lemon are pleasant in this zesty, full-bodied wine, but are accompanied by savory tones of dusty mineral and white button mushroom. The finish is brisk but clean.
A delicious array of aromas leap from this blend of 32% Mourvèdre, 8% Counoise, 20% Grenache and 20% Syrah: black cherry, cola just poured on ice, roasted game, Dr Pepper, black cardamom, roast beef char and sandalwood.

The vineyard sits at nearly a half-mile in elevation, and you'll find true mountain concentration to the blackberry jam, black cherry, raspberry, licorice, pepper and molasses flavors. The alcohol is quite high, but the wine feels rich and balanced.
Sweet cedar and cinnamon aromas and flavors of tart red cherry, vanilla and savory spice give this wine extra kick. It's still soft and integrated though—a dry and spicy but gentle red that has class.
Attems' fresh Pinot Grigio would wash down nicely with fried fish or onion rings. There's a touch of sweet honey and peach in the mouth and the close is crisp, lean and sharp.
This is a gorgeous interpretation of Aglianico in which the tannic grape is softened and rounded out thanks to quality winemaking. Aromas of chocolate fudge, exotic spice, rum cake and loads of black fruit appear on the bouquet. You will, however, feel that characteristic tightness on the long, drying finish.
This red blend shows its 51% Cabernet roots with strong red cherry and ripe plum fruit. Throughout, the notes of vanilla, cinnamon toast, and cream vie for attention over the likeable fruit. The snug, particulate tannins and alcohol heat make for a mouthfilling experience.
The new oak is dialed down a bit to 33% in this memorable red from the producer's estate Quail Hill Vineyard.

A touch of pollen adds earthy funk to pristine white blossom and pear notes on this brisk, invigorating wine. Searing acid swipes through the midpalate, but the delicate hints of sweet yellow-cherry persist through the finish.

A new venture to the Douro by Tejo-based Lagoalva, this is juicy, fruity and soft. While it misses the minerality of many Douro wines, it does have ripe plum fruit flavors, and an open, generous texture. This is a warm full-bodied wine that's ready to drink.

Solid and firm, it has powerful tannins and no sense yet of aging. The concentration is palpable, offering impressive weight while also bringing out ripe berry fruits. It needs until 2017–2018 to soften.
One of the three properties owned by Marie-Laure Lurton, Tour de Bessan's 2010 is a firm, smoky wine, dark and firm in character. It has weight, a solid and rich feel and a juicy black-currant note. The finish shows both aging potential and attractive fruitiness.
Bright but kind of light, with attractive red-fruit aromas. The mouth, however, is a touch stark and zesty, with juicy, jumpy cherry and plum flavors. Not overly stellar nor does it try to reach very far; good for Bonarda.
Green apple is the lead aroma along with yeasty vanilla and a dash of white pepper. There's modest roundness to the palate and nonscouring bright acidity. Slightly candied lime and mango flavors feature controlled bitterness on the finish.
For a five-grape blend priced like this, Don Tiburcio is well worth a go. The nose is rich and jammy, much like berry marmalade. The palate is on the heavy side, with sweet flavors of raisins, prune and chocolate. Rich on the finish, with fig and black plum as well as candied accents and tannic leftovers.
While sylphlike in mouthfeel, this outrageously ripe, rich auslese packs a punch of dried apricot, peach and pineapple flavors. Its sweetness penetrates deeply, punctuated by earthy fennel notes. It's delicious already but should improve through 2040, likely beyond.

Dried apricot, jasmine, flower, herb and peach aromas are followed by medium, sweet fruit flavors that can't quite sustain their intensity but still bring appeal.
Bought in 2006 by François Pinault, also owner of Bordeaux Château Latour, Domaine d'Eugenie (the former Domaine René Engel) is just starting out. Already the style, as in this wine, exhibits power, concentration and structure. But here, also, there is great, vibrant fruit, the red berry flavors rolling around the mouth.
Hints of tart redcurrant have a softenting creamy edge. The palate fizzes with tiny bubbles that disperse the red-fruited, creamy tartness across the palate.

A blend of 60% Nero d'Avola and 40% Frappato, this opens with scents of wild berry, rose and a light spice note. On the savory, easygoing palate, a touch of clove adds interest to crushed strawberry and Morello cherry. Fresh acidity brightens the juicy flavors.
A gorgeous evocation of Pinot Noir. Pours pale in color and translucent, suggesting it's not a heavy fruit bomb, and indeed it is not. Feels as light as a cloud, yet with intense flavors of red stone fruits, bacon and spices, and that feral, wild forest quality you get from the best Sonoma Coast Pinot Noirs. Bone dry, but so sweet in fruit and cedar, with wonderful acidity. Superb now, after decanting, and should develop over the next 6–8 years.

A massive Zinfandel, super-concentrated and intense, although bone dry, that shows potent tannins that may help it develop. Right now it's rather astringent and chewy, with dense flavors of blackberries and slightly bitter, earthier notes of tobacco and coffee. Could mellow beyond 2012.
Ruby in color, and light almost to the point of transparency. Flavors of cherry and toast define the palate, while the finish is a bit raw. Otherwise, it's a pleasing enough wine because of simple oak-driven raspberry flavors.
Very dry, and on the earthy side, this Chard is marked more by controlled elegance than by opulent fruit. There are flavors of lemons and limes and tart green apples, with additional complexities from barrel fermentation and sur lies aging. The finish is fairly acidic.
This is dry and crisp in acidity, with suggestions of oranges and buttered toast that wash out in the finish.

If you're looking for flavor, you'll find it in the extracted blackberry and cassis fruit. The tannins are considerable. If it has a fault, it's softness. Drink within the next few years.
There's lots to like in this blush wine, made from Bordeaux grapes. It shows spicy cherry and sweet anise flavors, and has enough crisp acidity to make it bright and clean.

Aromas of violet, wild strawberry and red raspberry carry through to the palate alongside hints of tea and rosemary. It's balanced and approachable with silky tannins and fresh acidity.
Framed beautifully with scents and flavors of toasted hazelnut (the property was orginally a walnut, hazelnut and plum orchard), this builds its substantial core around deep black cherry fruit. The density and length are impressive, and though delicious already, it will surely gain in complexity with further aging. Drink now through 2025.
Sweet and simple, this orange-colored blush will satisfy most fans of white Zin.
This lightweight Sauvignon is built on the grassy side, with herbal overtones only partially rounded out by modest passion fruit and peach on the midpalate. Despite some citrusy notes, it finishes soft, rather than bracing. Imported by New Zealand Wine Imports.

The herbal notes of fennel seed and licorice almost dominate the bouquet, but lifting aromas of black berry, currant and plum skin fight to flesh things out. The satin-textured mouth with dusty tannins shows stronger and riper fruit flavors of raspberry sauce and fresh fig. Drink now.
Here's a bright, dry and very fruity wine. It has Zinfandel-like flavors of wild red and black berries and stone fruits, with lots of dusty Indian spices and vanilla-caramel flavors from oak. The acidity tastes a bit unnatural given the high alcohol, but it's a good, rich wine.

A lovely bottle of Pinot Noir, dry and silky and considerably lighter in body than most. Despite the lightness of texture, the wine is powerful, with succulent raspberry, cherry, Dr. Pepper cola, anise and white pepper flavors that linger long in the finish.

An absolutely lovely Pinot, the best in Gainey's long career.

Dark and juicy, this wine offers a bit less spice and a little more concentration than the winery's other high-end Corbières offering, Le Pégourier.

Gripping yet well-structured in the mouth; drink Now–2015.
A selection of the best parcels of Alvarinho, this is a wood fermented wine. It is round and soft with as much spice as fruit. The texture is full, lightly tangy as well as hinting at minerality. The aftertaste, with its rich toast, is generous and suggests the wine is ready to drink.

This is essentially DDO's reserve Pinot Noir; it requires some patience at first, because it is quite tight, almost inscrutable. With many hours of breathing it fleshes out and opens up, revealing a wine with interesting nuances of cured meat, mushroom and light earth.

This absolutely must be decanted well in advance.

Here is a full-blown 15% bruiser. Chewy, tannic and rugged, from vines almost 40 years old.

All that stuffing needs some additional bottle time to loosen it up and soften the rough edges.
Here's one of Testarossa's more forward Pinots from the 2011 vintage, but that appeal is deceptive.

This tight, rather austere Syrah shows cool- climate flavors; it's hard and herbal, earthy and tannic, but there is a lot going on. It's not a fruit-driven wine, rather it has the earthy, composty complexity of a Cayuse Syrah, though less concentrated. Definitely a wine worth chasing.
This is nicely sculpted, and keeps just the right accents of green tea and leaf to show the varietal character. The aromas includes cedar and mocha and toast, but the barrel influence does not overwhelm the pleasingly tart berry-infused fruit.
86-88 Barrel sample. Totally dominated by wood, the fruit doesn't have the weight to support all that toast. It's hard to get beyond the spice to find the berry fruits and final fresh acidity.
The Tightrope bottling from Tendril winemaker Tony Rynders has the power and complexity of its companion “White Label” bottling, but it needs more time to pull itself together.

Here's a pleasantly fragrant and buoyant Prosecco with pretty floral notes followed by drying mineral, stone fruit and talc powder. The wine is firm and tonic in the mouth with cleansing acidity at the close.

Based around the 2013 vintage, this wine is young. Perfumed apple and pineapple fruits are tightly laced with lemon and crisp acidity. These contrast with the creamy mousse that adds a softer touch. Age this bottling until 2018.

This textured and toasty wine shows a gentle acidity through its spice and warm apple and apricot flavors. Its mineral edge is tangy, zesty and attractive. Built to age for the medium term, it will be ready drink from 2019.
This wine is dry and rather full bodied, starting with fruity aromas like banana and coconut then seguing to more nutty, oaky, complex flavors and a rich texture. It's a serious dinner wine with heft and substance.
This has a lovely entry that explodes with scents of toasted almond and espresso. The black cherry and sour plum flavors command your attention, with texture and balance throughout. Drink soon.
Linear, silky and long, this has ethereal tones of cola, licorice and dried mint. There's also a pretty mineral component of brimstone and talcum powder that gives the palate a dry feel.
Grassy, compost-like aromas carry a peanut accent and not much vivid fruit. This pinches down on what amounts to a clampy palate, while crisp, mildly green berry flavors finish minty and peppery.
Scratchy and herbal on the nose, this has dry raspberry aromas. It feels fresh, raw and racy, with cherry, red currant, rhubarb and an herb component to the flavor profile. It's vital but edgy feeling on the finish.
This extroverted and very yummy wine is dark and deep in color. It smells like it's drenched in blackberry jam and tastes almost as thick. Gobs of boysenberry and blackberry flavors carry hints of chocolate and cherry. It's not too full bodied, just full flavored.
A blend of 68% Shiraz, 18% Grenache, 10% Cinsault and 4% Tinta Barocca, this is one of the finest reds coming out of South Africa today. It is powerful and concentrated, yet elegant and refined, with notes of lush red cherry, raspberry and plum that are complemented by notes of game, pepper and fynbos. Fine yet gripping tannins and tight fruit flavors lend a solid structure to the rich mouthfeel, while notes of peppered berries and mentholated herbs linger long on the finish. Drink 2020–2025.
The Fess Parker team now serves this and other bubblies at their sparkling-dedicated Bubble Shack in Los Olivos. An all-Chardonnay bottling, Asian pear, lemon pith and wet clay are its primary aromas. The palate is all about minerality, its lime and tangerine flavors tinged with chalk, and crushed gravel.
Thick, like blueberry syrup, this is a soft, layered wine with notions of vanilla, toasted oak and spearmint that confound on the palate. A substantial, concentrated wine, it finishes in mocha chocolate.
Concentrated black and red berries show depth and meet tobacco, vanilla and sweet cake spice on the nose. The medium- to full-bodied palate brings cocoa-dusted dark bramble berries into the mix, with streaks of graphite adding levity. The tannins offer grip but are not completely overpowering, with tart red currant lightly lingering on the finish.
Just off-dry enough to be considered a dessert wine, this pretty Moscato was grown in the Sacramento Delta. It has appealing flavors of oranges and vanilla, balanced with crisp acidity, and the alcohol is a refreshingly low 10%.
Big, sweetened tannins reminiscent of tobacco and leather pouch sit atop cedar, herb and vanilla. The fruit is both red and black, true to the vineyard and this area of the Russian River.
With Sauvignon Gris and Muscadelle as part of the blend, this is an attractively perfumed wine. Apricot, pear and quince flavors are already well integrated. The texture is light, with just a touch of orange zest. Drink now.
Made from Pinot Gris, this pale colored wine has just a blush of rosé. It is so fresh and perfumed, only lightly textured. A fine apéritif style, the wine has juicy red currant flavors, topped with orange zest. Drink now.
On display are the requisite Cayuse flavors of funk, savory herb and composted earth, with moderately ripe black fruits in the background. A whiff of pine needles and plenty of forest floor accents complete the picture.
Campfire smoke appears to be the signature of this producer and the old vines planted in 1920 from which it sources. The wine is thick, ripe and soft. Black plum is the star on the palate, taking on a baked, jammy quality on the finish, accented in vanilla.
Dominated by wood from start to finish, from scents of vanilla, toast and dried spices, to flavors of cinnamon-dusted toast and a dry, cedary finish. There's enough fruit to support the wood, but not to shine through.
This wine is definitely woody, with tough toast over the fruit flavors and mineral texture, yielding a bitter, extracted character that will always feel dry. However, give it until 2016 and the fruit may get a chance to shine.
Red fruit aromas come with green notes of tomato leaf, oregano and sage. It tastes tangy, with flavors of tobacco and red berry. The finish is stalky and herbal tasting.

Well crafted and carefully executed, this off-gold wine delivers a bouquet of candied fruit, butterscotch, caramel and vanilla. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy, and it will appeal to those who appreciate a slightly oxidized style.
There's a very good wine in here, but the winery has released it far too early, which shifts the burden of cellaring to the buyer. Right now it's all primary fruit, acidity and oak. But the fruit is beautifully layered in tiers of roasted blackberries, grilled cherries and cola, and the oak is splendid. This dry, silky wine desperately needs to be held until at least late 2010, and should drink well through 2014.
A perfumed and crisp citrus wine that is light and fruity. It is soft and smooth with a light creamy texture and refreshing acidity. Ready to drink.
Oaky and full bodied, this conveys a strong impression of big berry fruit. Spice and herbal components are underplayed, letting the fruit come forth in all its glory. This is an attractive and ready-to-drink wine.
Attractive green fruit and citrus flavors. It has just a touch of pepper to go with its intensely fresh apple-skin-textured character. Bone dry, with lively acidity.
Firm and stalky, this wine has intense black currant fruitiness. A dry tannic core is balanced by the fresh fruits and acidity. It's almost too fruity at the moment and needs to soften, so wait until 2016.
This Barolo from the Brunate cru shows gorgeous characteristics of mature fruit, spice, natural rubber, asphalt, tar and root beer. The wine's personality is marked by a comforting, almost familiar territory-driven feel that recalls the greatest Nebbiolo-based wines from Piedmont. Save this bottle in your cellar for 10 years or more.
Made predominantly from Cabernet Franc, this includes Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Tempranillo as well. It's close in style to the winery's other reds, from its aggressively dark, roasted aromas to its charred wood and roasted coffee flavors. It delivers a hint of dark chocolate as well, and its tannins are heavy, with a bitter edge.
Faury has crafted a wonderfully quaffable Old World Syrah in '05, with scents of violets, cracked pepper and ripe blackberries, modest tannins and a crisp, clean finish. Drink now-2012. Imported by Kermit Lynch Wine Merchant.
Half Merlot, half Cab (mostly Franc) this “everyday” wine has lighter fruit but still plenty of the toasty, smoky barrel flavors that the winery's higher-priced reds. In other words, it's a perfect barbeque wine.
Dark orange-pink in color, this meaty, substantial wine doesn't skimp on flavor or body. It presents a rewarding and intense celebration of raspberry and cherry that delights on the palate and will do well at the table, indoor or out.
Too much of a good thing is how to characterize this Merlot. It's exceptionally ripe with cherries, red currants and mocha. It's also strong in oak. The result is a soft, syrupy confection.
A stunning range of black sage, fresh bay leaf, hearty mulberry, exotic cinnamon, raw beef and baking spice converge for a rugged yet pretty nose on this bottling from a vineyard planted in 1975. Elderberry and elderflower show on the sip, as do beet juice, dried ginger, crushed rocks, potting soils and a concentrated potpourri of purple flowers.
Shows the dark color, thick tannins and deep, concentrated flavors you expect from Petite Sirah. It's a big gulp of blackberry jam, espresso, dark chocolate and crushed black pepper, and the finish is thoroughly dry. Lacks the acidic vibrancy needed for aging, but a fine wine to drink now.
This is a structured, still young and extracted wine, with dark tannins and spice from the wood aging. In the background, the red-berry fruits are developing and filling out to give a balance to the wine. Drink from 2017.
Black-skinned fruit, cooking spice and balsamic aromas come together in this solid, straightforward Brunello. On the palate, firm, close-grained tannins frame black cherry jam, clove and vanilla flavors. Drink 2018–2022.
Funky and sharp at first, with aromas of a dog fresh out of the rain. The palate is choppy and a bit hot, with sharp, generic cherry flavors along with some carob. Finishes with angular, tart flavors and notes of coffee and mocha.
Released in November, has opened up nicely since. Breathes well in the glass; a hefty, aromatic, plummy wine showing nicely integrated soft cherry and tobacco notes, along with seductive streaks of citrus, clove and graphite. It's smooth but not at all flabby, displaying the hints of minerality that mark Ciel fruit.
This is an oaky, leesy Chardonnay, and quite a good one. Although it's super rich in fruit, it shows a crisply acidic minerality that grounds it and makes it serious. That fruit is wildly forward in pineapple tart, pear butter, Key lime pie and golden apricot.
By nature Albariño doesn't last long, and this is well past its prime. Chunky, mealy, soft aromas announce a fleshy, low-pulse palate with mealy peach flavors and no finish.
This is soft, sweet and syrupy, with a cherry pie flavor.
89—91 Barrel sample. Very rich fruit, very ripe, sweet wine tempered with botrytis dryness. Great full flavors of candied fruits and quince.
Bonacchi makes several expressions of Brunello. Molino del Piano is a ripe and plush wine with some savory aromas of cured meat and leather backed by Indian spice and black currant. Despite the ripeness, firm structure gives the wine austerity.
Bone-dry and austere, this is a wine for people who feel that fruit and sugar have no place in a sparkling wine. The aromas are of sun-baked earth and dust, with a trace of vanilla and white chocolate. All you really experience on the palate is acidity, alcohol and weight, although if you try hard you can imagine a squeeze of lime. It’s very clean.
Grapefruit and grit show on the nose. A narrow palate with a hint of spritz delivers short green melon flavors that turn slightly bitter prior to a peppery-tasting finish.
This single-vineyard Barolo is fragrant, with violet, leather and underbrush aromas. The palate shows bright red-cherry flavors and layers of cinnamon and other spices. Despite the forward nature of the vintage, this actually needs a few more years to open up.
A hint of rose petal breathes exotic perfume into this granite-laced Cabernet Franc. Ripe black cherry and graham cracker notes soften the palate and round out a moderately long, spicy finish. Drink now through 2017.
Bone dry, tough and leathery, with a bitter, raisiny edge to the blackberries and cherries. Drink now.
A fruity, spicy, vibrant Pinot Noir, easy to like for its richness, yet balanced and elegant, if a little direct in its appeal. It shows jammy flavors of raspberries, cherries and blackberries, with hints of cola and anisette liqueur and a sweet coating of sandalwood. Drink it now.
A delicious wine and very much the model for value in Spanish Garnacha. That this has 25% Tempranillo only seems to make it better; the nose is sweet but full and plummy. The palate is pure, flavorful and sweet, with baked cherry, earthiness and a hint of chocolate. A wine to buy in quantity, i.e. by the case.
Huge and dense, it shows immense tannins as well as layers of ripe, juicy fruits. The combination is complex, dark and brooding in this young wine. It is going to develop a rich structure as it ages. Drink from 2016.
Alvarinho is the grape of northern Vinho Verde, giving a style that is rich and complex. The fruit here fits that character, packed with pear, apple and citrus flavors and a light texture of lime zest. Note: this wine is commercialized as Follies Alvarinho outside the U.S.
Bone dry and crisp, but unripe, with minty feline aromas and flavors dominating the citrus fruits.
This prestige cuvée from Jacquart is a blend of grand and premier crus, giving a wine that is rich, round and approaching maturity with a dense, deep series of fruit and creamy toast flavors. It's a beautiful Champagne at this stage, poised between youth and maturity. The aftertaste leaves a crisper, fruitier end.
Black as coal, with a heavy, smoky, meaty nose, this is one of a growing number of excellent biodynamic Syrahs from Oregon. It marries tangy acids to chewy red and blue fruits, with streaks of coffee liqueur and caramel latté. Half was whole-cluster fermented, and it all spent time in 50% new French oak.
Here's an easy, well-valued red blend of Refosco, Raboso and other indigenous grapes from the Verona area with an approachable, no-fuss disposition and aromas of blueberry, forest floor and lingering sweet spice. It has plush berry flavors and a gritty, raw texture.
The richness of this superb wine comes from the concentrated fruit flavors allied to the densely textured acidity and minerality. It's so complex, with both warmth and an icicle crispness. It's ready for aging over at least 5 years.
The wine is rich and packed with superripe blackberry fruits. While there is acidity to keep the wine crisp, it does have a heavy feel to it from the high alcohol that also brings a pepper edge. Drink from 2018.
This is the fourth vintage for this rare Washington version of Petite Sirah, and the best yet. It doesn't have the sheer weight and bulk of California wines, but its firm acids, sweet tannins and ripe black cherry fruit adds a stylish, almost elegant spin to the grape.
Cool, dark-plum aromas are mildly herbal. This feels drawn-in and tough. Disposable berry flavors come with peppery notes, while the finish doesn't offer much new.
A deliciously drinkable Pinot for drinking now with a great steak. Shows the good acidity of Carneros, with a light silky mouthfeel and ripe wild cherry, red currant, rose petal and white pepper flavors, accented with smoky, caramelized oak barrels.
Burgundian technique was used in this wine, and the aromas and tastes of those techniques dominate. The wine is heavy in leesy, yeasty, toasted oak notes, which dominate, rather than subtlely support, the underlying fruit.
Spiced-apple aromas lead to a soft, perfumed wine that has a crisp, fruity edge. The apple and green-plum flavors give attractive acidity. Drink now.

This classic blend of Douro grapes is soft, fruity and fresh. It has a mineral edge to the texture, giving a tangy character as well as a more complex set of flavors to the palate. Drink now, although the wine will be better from 2016.
All stainless-fermented and aged, this deserves to be on your short list of can't-miss choices in a domestic Chardonnay. Year after year it scores well, with fresh, vivid fruit, a crisp and inviting mouthfeel, lively spices and ripe tree fruits. There's a seam of wintergreen running alongside in this new vintage, leaving your mouth feeling scrubbed clean.
The first sniff is yeasty and beery, a nod to the wine's youth. With ample air it brings in light hints of citrus blossom, lemon verbena and mint. Flavors of lemon and pineapple come next, and the small percentage that was barrel fermented helps to round off the acids.
Full barrique aromas work great with the wine's overriding ripe, rubbery black fruit. Aromas of lemon peel, char and pulsing berry lead toward lively raspberry, plum and herb flavors.  Smooth and well rounded. An elevated wine. Imported by Quintessential LLC.
Named for Dr. Harold Olmo, a UC Davis viticulturalist, this red is 42% Cabernet Franc, with Merlot, Cab Sauvignon, Malbec and Petit Verdot making up the balance. With such a makeup, its core of very taut red plum shouldn't come as a surprise. Also has top-to-bottom herbal accents and a tangy-oak finish—all told, a good, but rather tough, unfamiliar style of wine for most.
A rather delicate style, with bits of smoke, dried herbs and spice accenting cherry fruit. Light-bodied, but with pretty aromatics and good flavor intensity. Drink now–2008. Imported by DC Imports LLC.
Rich, ripe and full aromas of baked apple and melon are laced with spicy accents of cinnamon, ginger and vanilla bean. Medium weight but well-balanced in the mouth; bright acidity and minerality tie everything together on the palate. A lime flavor lingers on the long close, followed finally by a touch of spice. Drink now–2015.
Already mature, this medium-bodied wine offers scents of dried fruit and leather, then flavors of caramelized, roasted black cherries and more leather. It's a bit coarsely textured, then falls away on the finish. Drink soon.
This is a blend of 81% Cabernet Sauvignon, 18% Merlot and 1% Cabernet Franc, and all of the fruit came from old vines from two of Washington's most revered vineyards, Champoux and Weinbau. Supple and ripe, it's packed with a brilliant, flavorful mix of berries, cherries and cassis. The tannins are polished, and the barrel-derived notes of toast, cinnamon, coffee and caramel linger through the long, smooth finish.
Made from the little-known Nuragus grape, which is indigenous to the island of Sardinia, this is a terrific seafood wine for a warm summer afternoon. It showcases notes of citrus, peach and white flower.
Erath is on a single-vineyard crusade; the number of different bottlings is downright dizzying. This particular vineyard, just outside of the town of Dundee, produces a relatively soft wine, spicy with pine needles and herbs, and finishing with a distinctly metallic note that flattens out the flavors.
Banana and ripe red-berry flavors are attractive and bright. It has a slight raw edge due to its youthfulness, but it would make for a juicy apéritif if lightly chilled.
From R.H. Phillips, itÕs a shade oakier and more refined than their regular bottling. The peach flavors are more concentrated, and sappier, but it comes at the cost of crispness. The wine sags in the mouth, like a Dali melted watch. But it tastes good.
Just released, this latest non-vintage from Jacquesson is very steely, austere, cool and elegant with apple and citrus acidity. It has freshness and balance. Still young, but very complete.
Cinnamon, vanilla and toasted-oak notes accent the black cherry, raspberry and boysenberry fruit core of this accessible wine. Ripe, mouthfilling black-fruit flavors carry through to the medium-length close. Drink now.

Very fruity but nice and dry, this wine smells like cantaloupe and tastes like honeydew melon. It's well balanced, full bodied, and has a good crisp element propelling it from the palate to the finish.
This is the top Douro wine in the Burmester portfolio. It is appropriately firm, mineral, with tight black fruits and solid, dry tannins. Underneath all this is richness, but it will certainly need several years—3 to 4 at least.
90–92. Barrel sample. Dry, dusty tannins from ripe fruit dominate this concentrated wine. It's solid and chunky, with lush fruit showing through a dark structure.
A blend of 75% Sauvignon Blanc and 25% Sémillon, this definitely reflects the cool 2011 vintage in its steely tension. The clean green-fruit flavors are well defined and highlighted with notes of grassy herbs and saline minerality.
A mighty good Zin that shows again how beautifully Napa Valley can ripen this difficult variety. Made from the winery's St. Helena estate vineyard, this wine has the classic structure of a fine Cabernet, but with Zin's plummy, wild berry and spice flavors.
This reserve-level wine is down to just three barrels in this vintage. It's creamy and yet precisely defined, with generous layers of pineapple, lime, golden apple and lemon tea. A bracing minerality underscores gently oaked, finishing notes of melba toast and almond butter.
There's good funk and bad funk; this is right on the border. Scents of earth and compost, gamy meat and bitter greens run amok on the palate, almost concealing the fruit. The interplay of flavors and the overall complexity and length mark this as a Spofford Station Syrah, but just as it should be knitting together, it falls apart, leaving a trail of black olives in its wake.
Muscular and slightly austere, this wine does offer attractive notes of mint and blueberry. Some meaty nuances creep in, adding welcome complexity. Although firm, it's approachable now, yet should age well through 2025.
A dusty, sunbaked note in the aroma of this full-bodied wine meets robust and ripe fruit, wood smoke and very concentrated clove, black cherry and dark-chocolate flavors. The color is dark and deep, tannins are very firm, and the mouthfeel is somewhat astringent. This wine needs time to reach its peak, and will be best after 2022.
Hard and tough in tannins now, with a dry astringency. It's a good, balanced Cabernet, with very rich blackberry, currant and chocolate flavors, but those gritty tannins are difficult. Give it a few years in the cellar.
Golden hay in color, this clonal exploration imparts light-bodied peach, graham cracker and orange flavors, the latter showing prominently on the nose. Bright acidity keeps it youthfully refreshing, with both body and weight in balance.
Good price for a sparkling wine this delicious and refined. Offers lots of bubbly pleasure, with orange, lime, vanilla, honey and yeasty flavors. Made from Chardonnay and Pinot Blanc.
Aged in 70% new French oak, the wine shows a lot of barrel toast, coffee and chocolate flavors. The tannins are stiff and the fruit lean, with tart flavors of red berry. More bottle age may help to soften the oak flavors.
This is the vineyard that surrounds the winery on Ribbon Ridge, and it seems always to produce the wines with the greatest concentration and density. The black cherry fruit, with aromatic accents of rose petals and highlights of oregano, digs deep into the midpalate, creating an impression of a bulky, tight, compact wine with miles yet to go. Cellar it for drinking from 2020 through 2030.
This one's an odd duck. Ripe, honeyed peach and caramelized pineapple aromas and flavors turn tart and metallic on the finish, resulting in a package that's disjointed and ultimately unsatisfying.
Made in the modern style of oaky softness and jammy ripe fruit. Shows appealing pineapple, pear, buttered toast and vanilla cream flavors, with just enough acidity for balance.
A long oak regime (36 months in barrel) helps cement this Amarone's tones of barbecue sauce, cola, savory spice and dark fruit. The wine shows a ripe, chewy quality with loads of masculine power and intensity.
This Champagne exhibits both the freshness of the vintage and a sense of toasty maturity. Baked apple aromas are touched with notes of almonds and cookies. The palate is substantially weighty with a density of flavors and a rich, full aftertaste. Ready to drink now.
Aromas of sawdust, stewed plum and chocolate unfold in the glass. The forward palate doles out blackberry extract, fleshy cherry, toast, anise and espresso alongside velvety tannins. Drink through 2021.
Ripe and fruity, loaded with soft, plush, blackberry/black cherry fruit. This is a sweet, soft, open and forward style—a rather dramatic shift in style that was sparked, no doubt, by newly-installed, California-trained winemaker Bob Bertheau, who guided this vintage from the start. Though delicious and ripe, it could stand to be tightened up a bit.
Rosé should be dry, delicate and crisp in acidity. This Grenache, Mourvèdre and Syrah blend succeeds on two of those levels, but not dryness. The raspberry fruit has a simple jamminess that's almost dessert-style.
This special cuvée is named after the cellar workers whose job was to watch over casks of the best wines. Like other Henriot wines, this is dry, rich and toasty; it's fresh and citrusy on the finish.
The Solus Merlot is unabashedly ambitious, with upfront vanilla from toasty new oak, a high level of extraction and a dense, black core of ripe fruit. It's full bodied, with steely tannins and a long finish of fig and char. Try with a pan-seared steak.

Dark-skinned berry, scorched earth, clove, worn leather and oak-driven spice scents present themselves to the nose.

This gentle, fruity wine is softly textured and already drinkable. Ripe berry fruits show well, with a juicy acidity that adds to the richness of this open, friendly wine.
A deep, concentrated, impressive wine that works on many levels. There are the blackberry fruits, almost jammy, that are enhanced by the tobacco and new wood flavors. Then there is the strong, underlying dryness that promises considerable aging. And there is the elegance. A smooth wine whose tannins work around the core of structure and style.
Tough and tannic, this is made in a more aggressive style than many of today's Cabernets. There's a rich, intense core of blackberry jam that suggests superbly ripe fruit, and the oak is well integrated. Those tannins make it hard to appreciate at this time. Your best bet is to cellar the wine for a good eight years.
Ribolla Gialla typically delivers unique aromas of caramel, butterscotch and candied fruit. This expression delightfully embodies those characteristics, with extra structure and creaminess on the close.
Gets the job done with its rich tannins, crisp acids and solid blackberry, mocha and orange zest flavors. Easy to drink, and ready now. Production was 1,685 cases.
92-94. Barrel sample. Ripe and sweet tannins combine easily with this wine's juicy fruit and spice notes. All of the elements hang comfortably together.
An impressively full wine, its ripe apricot flavors melding seamlessly into rich wood and concentrated flavors. The lemon acidity enlivens the ripe yellow fruits, leaving a rich final impression.

A very fine Syrah, dry and rich, but also a very young one whose tannins now lock down the mouth with a sandpapery astringency. Yet with its complex array of blackberries and cherries, it should evolve through the next 4–6 years, gradually picking up interest.

The wine is soft, lightly fruity with acidity that is balanced. It's unfocused wine and lacks character.
Toast, moist earth, iris and grilled herb aromas lead the nose. The lean, simple palate offers sour cherry, French oak and clove flavors, while raspy but fleeting tannins leave a drying finish. You'll also find a bitter, green note of powdered sage on the finish.
This is a supple, medium-weight wine filled with the flavors of Chianti: cherries, earth and tobacco. If the tannins are suppler than most and the fruit a shade darker and riper, it's probably because of the heat of this vintage, but the wine retains a crisply acidic bite on the finish.
The hallmark of Angela Soleno's wines is a sweet, spicy and earthy tobacco note, and this blend of 33% Merlot, 33% Petit Verdot and 33% Sangiovese offers it in droves. Combine that with rich black plum, fresh-picked lilac and rose scents, cinnamon and red currant flavors and soft, creamy tannins, and it's a stunning wine.
An immensely ripe Riesling, full of dense white fruit flavors, this wine is still an infant. The structure and the richness of the fruit are there waiting to be aged, up to 10 years or more. A powerful wine, made with skill by Jean-Claude and Christophe Rieflé.
Rusty in color, with rubbery, chemical aromas. Feels tight, tannic and clampy, with hard, compromised flavors and bitterness to the finish. Astringent and just not that appealing.
Relatively light in color, this lower-alcohol wine from a vineyard in the Corralitos area shows dried rose petals, bergamot, lavender, cinnamon and a tiny bit of mushroomy funk on the nose. Once sipped, pomegranate, dark cranberry and orange-peel elements are lifted by pencil lead, rosemary and a strong thyme component.
Lots of ripe, flashy cherry, mocha, licorice, spice and oak flavors in this dry wine, which is marked by the softness a nice Merlot should have. A good companion with almost anything calling for a medium-bodied red.
Acidic and minty, this Pinot has underripe green flavors that interfere with the enjoyment greater richness would provide. The thinness emphasizes the astringent tannins.
The nose is quite shy but the palate is more expressive, offering white peach, mature green apple and candied nectarine zest. A light frothy mousse and fresh acidity brighten the rich flavors.
Dry and austere, with flavors of herbs and cherries sharpened with acidity and gritty tannins. Mainly Carignane.
This is on the lean side, with tomato-leafy—almost ashy—notes that impart a dry, austere quality to the white grapefruit flavors.
Here's a dark and sophisticated Nebbiolo with an informal twist (including a glass cork that locks in freshness). Fruit characteristics include white cherry, forest berry and wild raspberry. Thanks to 10 months of oak aging, you also get structure, softness, spice and tobacco.
Belle-Vue changed its usual blend for 2012 to emphasize the ripe Cabernet Sauvignon. That gives a fresh black currant-flavored wine that is layered with ripe tannins and acidity. Fruity, it will develop quickly, so drink from 2017.
Cedary oak aromas are draped heavily over this smoky, dark, cheesy-smelling Rioja. The mouthfeel is tight, tannic and resiny, but also spunky and properly acidic. Raw oak, coconut and vanilla accent dark-berry core flavors, while the finish is much like the bouquet: toasty and woody.
A blend of Sangiovese and 10% Ciliegiolo, this wine has a fruit and spice aroma of crushed red berries, white pepper and clove with a whiff of coffee. The tightly woven palate delivers black cherry, black raspberry, chocolate, mocha and black pepper alongside assertive, tongue-drying tannins.
This is an exotically rich blend of Syrah and some Bordeaux varieties. It's a bit direct in primary fruit, but could develop some bottle complexity in a year or two. Shows blackberry, cherry, leather, currant, violet, anise, sandalwood and crushed black pepper aromas and flavors, with a chocolaty finish.
Initial impressions are smoky and savory, but the nose opens to reveal aromas of freshly pressed apple, lemon and crushed minerals. The palate is ripe with sunny tangerine and yellow peach flavors, but moderated with piercingly tart lemon-lime acidity. Finishes moderately long on a sumptuous honey-tangerine note.
Too extracted, flat and candied for my tastes, this Pinot has a medicinal cherry flavor, with a thick, sappy texture.
This generous, fruity and lightly sweet wine should please a crowd with its butter and vanilla aromas, rich apple, pear and baking-spice flavors and rounded mouth-filling texture.
A touch of flint, some spritz and the zesty tang of both lemon and grapefruit peel make this racy and sleek . An addictive seam of bright acid puls through to a long, lingering and clean finish.
This crisp, fruity wine has delicious acidity. Gray-pink in color, it is ripe with red berries that also impart attractive freshness. The wine is crisp, tangy and textured at the end.
A shy, floral nose subtly emanates from the glass in this lightly built, elegant expression from the spectacular vineyard in the Petaluma Gap. Anise, sea salt and preserved lemon flavors form its foundation; subtle oak and tense acidity provide support.
Made with Sangiovese and 10% Merlot, this informal wine opens with aromas of violet and red berry. The easy-drinking palate offers black cherry and a hint of white pepper alongside soft, fleeting tannins. It's already extremely accessible so enjoy soon.
A little too soft in acids, and gooey in cassis and oak flavors, but this wine has good, rich tannins and a chocolaty taste on the finish.
A simple, fruity wine that features ample pink grapefruit and gooseberry aromas and flavors, this is a bit of a one-trick pony, but it delivers those bold fruit flavors with authority. Drink up.
The bouquet is mildly intense, with soft pear and delicate apple skin as the only distinguishable elements. More apple and bitter citrus appear in the mouth, with almost a hoppy character developing on the finish. Drink now.
This is the kind of light and informal wine you can pair with pasta with fresh tomato sauce and basil. Made with Nero d'Avola grapes, it offers aromas of cherry, raspberry, almond and roasted pistachio nut.
The cellar of this estate once became a secluded meeting place for lovers, bringing about the name of the wine. This is a mature wine, showing how well Muscadet can develop. Aged for two years on its lees, it has richness as well as plenty of remaining fresh apple fruit. Now at its peak, the wine is ready to drink.
Lifted, floral and fruity, with cassis, raspberry and balsam wood on the bouquet. The palate is both lush and balanced, and therefore it captures the best of what Chile can offer with Cabernet. Flavors of cassis, plum and chocolate are jazzed up by hints of herb and leather, and overall it's right where it should be. Drink now through 2012.
Luxurious on the nose and palate, this has loads of sweet, juicy peach, melon and white blossom. Dry in style, with notes of waxy lemon peel and a brisk oyster-shell minerality, this builds in elegance and complexity on the palate. Drink now.
While this is certainly structured, the wine shows green pepper flavors and very fresh raspberries, a product of the lightness of the vintage. It is attractive, offering some good freshness, but needs to be consumed now.
This blend of 85% Sangiovese and 15% Alicante has aromas of espresso, blue flower, red and black berries. The palate offers toasted oak, coffee, bell pepper, and black cherry accented with black pepper. It closes with astringent wood tannins.
Valpolicella Vigneto Sant'Urbano offers very bright, albeit, one-dimensional aromas of red cherry and blueberry. The mouthfeel is crisp and smooth and the wine promises to pair with light meat or pasta.
Unexpected notes of soy sauce and ginger are awkward at first, but fall comfortably within a greater aromatic context of black fruit, plum, cherry, prune and licorice. There's deep berry succulence in the mouth, with oak tones at the back that glide over polished texture and feel.
Both ripe fruit and tannins come through strongly in this wine. It's dense and richly layered, with black fruit and a firm texture. It shows fine potential now and is likely to age well. Drink from 2020.
Waxy, peachy aromas are less than fresh, and the palate follows that lead via soft, pithy flavors of orange and melon. Shows little grip or structure for Godello and the finish fails to bring it home with kick or pop. Already past its prime. Tasted twice.
An elegant wine from the relatively cool Lavaux St.-Jacques vineyard. Soft tannins surround sweet fruit. The structure is fine, delicate, but certainly present, giving a final solid aftertaste.
$14 is a pretty good price for a Chardonnay that shows such ripe, succulent fruit. It's rich in oranges, pineapples, limes and mangoes, brightened with crisp acidity. Entirely unoaked, the finish is dry, pure and clean.
The name of this wine doesn't lie; if you like mint, then this one's definitely for you! Gorgeous notes of fresh eucalyptus take center stage to the blackberry and boysenberry fruit backbone. The menthol continues on in the mouth, with a gripping and structured finish that tastes like Thin Mint crumbles.
Still kicking almost 20 years later, with good grip and fine tannins on the palate. Flavors are of black plum and earth; could still go another 5–10 years.
Firm and tannic, this has structure that's buttressed by ripe, jammy fruit and intense acidity. Solid and powerful, this is impressive and ageworthy.
This opens with delicate aromas suggesting mocha, black-skinned berry and vanilla. The dense palate delivers black currant jam, clove and tobacco alongside taut tannins. Enjoy through 2020.
Fresh-smelling and generous in flavors, this full-bodied wine tastes like plums and black cherries with hints of dried herbs. A savory, almost meaty quality makes it rather serious and complex in a good way.

Tight, light and layered in freshly baked bread and firm cherry and cranberry, this is a soft, rounded Pinot from an inland Sonoma Coast site that's balanced, food-friendly and ready to enjoy now through 2016.

This wine's light and refreshing nose cuts between orange-blossom ripeness, lime-juice sharpness, chalky minerality and a touch of milk fat. There is good energy on the palate, powered by tart green apple rinds and citrus zest.
This inky and opaque Chianti Classico is made in an international style, offering intense oak and vanilla aromas. The palate shows overripe plum, espresso and green bell pepper flavors. While it starts off plush, it has short length with a drying, tannic finish.
Aromas are redolent of a candy store—cotton candy, watermelon sours and candied apples. The palate is a sharp contrast, dry, austere and a bit thin. A few years in the cellar will help tame the piercing acidity.
86-88 Barrel sample. High spice wood, dark tannins, solid texture,but dense sweetness. The aftertaste is ripe, with freshness.
This offers savory aromas of cured meat, bacon and cigar tobacco that slowly segue to ripe notes of prune and blackberry preserve. It's heavy and thick on the finish.
Spring wild flower and green apple aromas lead the nose. The apple note follows over to the racy palate, joining white peach and citrus peel. Brisk acidity and a vivacious perlage offset the fruity flavors.
With a good depth of flavor, this is a rich wine, showing a touch of toast to go with its grapefruit flavor and apple skin texture. It's a wine that tends towards dry, with a bright acidity and a lively burst of mousse on the finish.
Fresh but creamy notes of ripe Conference pear on the nose mute into a peppery, herbal, yeast-savory palate with verve and freshness of utter typicity. This is textbook Grüner that offers the full and perfect package of spice, freshness and fruit on a light but concentrated body. The finish is both long and clean.
Citrus peel, naked rock and cold mountain streams are the images conjured up by the first whiff of this fine, featherlight Riesling. Sprightly and fresh, wired and zesty, it is a reminder of the bracingly fresh and thrilling 2014 vintage. This will provide supreme refreshment on a hot day but also keep its cool in years ahead. Riesling ahoy!
Viader has a long history of producing great Bordeaux-style blends grown at a high elevation on Howell Mountain. This 2010 is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, with almost the same percentages as the superb 2009 bottling. The wine is rich, dry and complex. It shows a fantastic array of blackberries, dates and dark chocolate, with fascinating notes of lavender and dill. The tannins are gorgeous, the acidity fine, and the application of oak is deft. It's hard to describe just how good this wine feels in the mouth. Drink now, after decanting, or within the next 20 years.
Tropical and creamy, the aromas thick in grapefruit and pineapple, this light, citrus-tinged, refreshing 100% Sauvignon Blanc is well-balanced and easy to enjoy, approachable with some depth.
Exceedingly dark, with chewy herbal tannins and high-toned somewhat volatile aromas, this is a wine that has not knit together. Black cherry, kirsch, fig and balsamic elements are scattered about, but nothing holds the center. Best to drink up soon.
Tart and bright, with an almost-jammy mix of raspberry and strawberry preserves, this concentrated, fruit-powered Merlot overdelivers for the price. Along with the luscious fruit are darker streaks of iron, coffee grounds and char, all in a classy, well-designed, four-vineyard blend.
Waxy aromas suggest haystack and dusty apple. This is on the borderline of heavy and cloying in the mouth, while oak is the main driver of the flavor profile. On the finish, notes of melon and banana are covered by a resiny oak flavor.
This vintage has some Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot in the blend to back the Sangiovese and Merlot, and is more complex and complete. There's cherry, tobacco, leather, spice, black fruit and a touch of cool freshness in the form of leafy greens. It's a sophisticated wine with tight tannins and a long, dusty finish.
This three-grape white blend starts with oily aromas and weight before finding some minerality and white-fruit notes. The palate has citrusy kick and zing to bolster green apple and orange flavors. The finish is wide, a touch clumsy and citrusy in flavor, with tang and lasting freshness.
Delicate aromas of black-skinned berry, raisin and cooking spice lift out of the glass. On the straightforward palate, hints of vanilla and licorice add interest to ripe black cherry while pliant tannins provide easygoing support. Drink through 2020.
At the tender young age of three, this is still tight, angular and bold, laden with crunchy black-cherry fruit that's framed by hints of sandalwood and cedar. The fruit tannins are silky smooth, shored up by woody notes on the finish, but expect those to resolve over the next few years. Drink 2015–2020, possibly longer.
In how many places in the world would you find an innovative blend of Merlot (60%) and Pinot Noir (40%)? This is a soft, supple wine that reflects those structural aspects of the grapes, adding black cherry and plum flavors and a layer of oaky spice.
This is an incredibly young wine with its spice and red-berry fruits right up there and still almost just fruit juice. That means that it has the potential to be an attractive, easy, spicy wine and will need to age. It will be best from 2017.
Mostly Sauvignon Blanc, with 10% Sémillon, this graceful wine opens with some sharp, grassy and grapefruity scents, then softens up a bit, with a textural middle that hints at sage, melon, smoke and herb. Huge improvement over the 2006.

A blend of 90% Picolit, 5% Sauvignon and 5% Friulano, this opens with aromas that recall dried yellow peach, candied ginger and a hint of exotic spice. Made with dried grapes, the rich creamy palate delivers apricot jam, baked pear and hint of acacia honey.
Rusty in color, with initial aromas of smoke, dried leaves, herbs, tobacco and subtle berry. That all indicates that it's not overdone, and thus the tobacco, earth and dried fruit flavors are par for the course. Dry and leafy on the finish, which indicates that now is the time to get at it.
A beautifully supple, delicately silky wine. The flavors are of red cherries and hints of clove, vanilla, toasted coconut and bacon. Dry and crisp, this Pinot drinks well now and should remain harmonious through 2009.
Merlot (43%) and Cabernet Sauvignon (30%) take the lead on this supremely appealing blend that hails from a who's who selection of vineyards. Notes of black raspberries, currant and milk chocolate come with sweet, luscious fruit flavors.
Fruity and simple, with jammy flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants, cocoa and sweet, smoky oak. Made in a soft, modern style to appeal now.
Extremely rich, soft and fruity, like blackberry pie drizzled with melted chocolate. The tannins are lush, complex and gentle. Made in the modern way, it's certainly delicious, but almost too much of a good thing.
A ripe and juicy wine, the wood flavors giving considerable spice character. Acidity and blackberry fruits work into a wine that has an attractive, if rough-at-the-edges, character.
Pretty and fresh, with vibrant, well-defined strawberry fruit on the nose set against a backdrop of white flowers. Turns a bit simple and fleeting in the mouth. Drink up.

87-89 Solid, chunky wine, full of dense tannins, concentrated fruit. There is a powerful feel to it.
Gorgeously nuanced nose, with almond, marzipan, melon, lime and fresia up front, set against a palate of Brazil nut and cinnamon toast. Soft and lush, the long finish picks up a nutmeg accent. Noticeable sweetness suggests this wine will work well as an apéritif. Drink now for its freshness or cellar a few years for more complexity.

This is definitely a drink-now effort, with tart red currant fruit, stiff tannins and assertive acids. There's a strong leafy/herbal streak underlying the fruit.
A firm, licorice-flavored wine, with bitter notes and a peppery character that shows through the fruit. It feels extracted and hot.
Comes off as a slightly skinny Pinot Noir, with herbal overtones to the cherry and strawberry flavors. Still, it's varietally true, and light enough in body to pair effectively with chicken or salmon. Drink now.
Dark garnet in the glass, this wine features aromas of black cherry, candle wax and freshly picked oregano. Soft tannins offer a foundation for flavors of cherry, cassis, mint, espresso bean and Mediterranean herbs. Fruit and savory notes continually make way for one another on the palate, concluding in an herbal and lemon zest finish.
A very structured wine that seems ready for aging. Its tannins are still firmly present, lying over the dark black fruit. Acidity gives the wine a rich, juicy finish.
This was another solid version of the modern Dolcetto, showing dark fruit, spice and a core of plum jam. The tannins need a year or so to become civilized, but overall this is a versatile wine that will be very food friendly.

Released after the 2011 vintage, this elegant wine has great presence. A blend of Touriga Nacional and Touriga Franca, if offers vibrant, structured fruit while still reserving its full glory for several more years. Ripe fruits blend with intense acidity at the end. Drink from 2017.
92-94 Barrel sample. Very sweet new wood, caramel aromas that give the wine an initial softness. Then acidity and sweet blackberry flavors move in, suggesting that this will be a finely balanced wine once it is bottled.
Ripeness of peach, citrus, apple and pear shimmers everywhere. The palate is clean, very fruit-driven and fresh, if a little upfront. Drink this refreshing and dry wine soon.

A nice Cabernet to drink now. It has very ripe, upfront cherry and blackberry pie flavors, with firm tannins and a sweet vanilla note.

Tilled soil, forest floor, mature black-skinned fruit, leather and a truffle note come together in the glass. The firmly structured palate presents juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon, vanilla and an earthy hint of game while assertive, close-grained tannins provide support. Give it a few years for the tannins to relax then enjoy. Drink 2019–2023.
A hulk of a wine with forced oak that results in aromas of mint, char, citrus peel and smoke. The palate is endowed with ample black cherry, raspberry and mocha flavors, while the finish mixes orange peel, chocolate and a lot of leftover wood resin. Interesting but very oaked up and not quite in perfect balance.
Though just two years past fermentation, this is already taking on a mature hue with hints of bricking around the rim. It's soft, smooth and lightly toasty, a blend of rose water and wild raspberry flavors that have the precision and elegance to impress. Though light and low in alcohol, it's a well-made, true-to-variety style.
Here's a sturdy, somewhat country-style red wine with some superior qualities. Although it's a bit rough in texture, it has bright, jammy flavors of black raspberries and cherries, with hints of cola and cocoa.
The poised, clean and lifted wild black-cherry fruit mixed with notions of cocoa forms the aromatic theme. A very elegant wine, with medium body and alluring depth, it's currently tight and held firmly by structured, ripe tannins, while the acidity is bright and refreshing. With its youthful primary fruit, this is charming, but even a year or two will make this more pretty than it is right now.
Oak is the main characteristic in this Malbec. Spicy aromas of clove and mint steer otherwise generic berry scents toward a thick palate with pointed acidity. This is short on complexity and the fruit is mildly sour, while mint, oak and baked notes define the finish.
Shines with elegance and class right from the start of the toasty, yeasty, appley bouquet with vanilla hints. It's a joy to taste, with its full, complex flavors, ripe mouthfeel and long finish. A great example of how far wines designated Kosher have come, and what is possible in this category.
Steer clear of this one if you like your Sauvignons done in stainless. This one is 100% barrel fermented, yielding some toasty, smoky aromas that blend well with the forceful tropical fruit flavors. There's guava and pineapple, smoke and menthol on the long finish.
This is a floral take on Merlot, in both scents and flavors; owing at least in part to the inclusion of 7% Petit Verdot. The wine gathers strength and fleshes out as it warms in the glass, and layers in darker notes with smoke and coffee and tar. A steely style, muscular and tight, it smoothes out nicely with breathing time, and shows excellent aging potential.
Slight tar notes hold the brimming dark berry fruit in check for now. The palate is structured and mouth-filling. Glints of peppery spice appear among the crushed blackberry. This is muscular and toned: Drink now with steak or keep until 2016–2017, when this will be perfect for braised venison and game.
Lovers of the purest mineral Riesling, very steely, will go crazy for this wine. It is tightly woven around a core of green and white fruits and the crispest, knife-edge sharp acidity. It is for aging, to produce a stunning wine in 4–5 years at a minimum.
Stalky, gritty aromas don't stir much optimism. This feels dry, hard and tannic, while salty, herbal, horsey red-berry flavors finish with some moderate heft and a clampy feel.
Light flavors mix citrus and stone fruits, with hints of honey and lemongrass. Just a tad above bone dry, it's finished with 8g/L residual sugar.
Not a successful wine. It's unripe, with asparagus aromas and flavors dominating the cherries.
Plenty of herbal, mushroomy notes in the nose. The wine is light, soft and fruity. The mushroom flavors could be a real asset with the right food. Finishes true to form, with nothing off.
Elegant and fragrant, this opens with aromas of pressed rose, crushed violet, wild berry and a whiff of baking spice. The vibrant, focused palate delivers juicy red cherry, raspberry, white pepper, cinnamon and dried herb. It's well balanced, with supple tannins and bright acidity. Drink through 2018.
Beautiful young bubbly, light and elegant, with Chardonnay flavors of peaches and limes, enriched with leesy dough and smoky spice. The texture is ultrarefined, with a very fine mousse. This is one of the best, most complex Chandon bruts in a long time.
Weighted in tannins and oak, this wine is also perfumed in ripe berry and chocolate, along with dried herb. Bittersweet tobacco marks the finish, complemented in vanilla.
Wood-aged Malbec, and yes, the wood is all there. There is some fruit, red berries and some sweetness, but the wood dominates at this stage. Give it two years. Very provisional as of now.
Named after one of the proponents of Saint-Amour wines, this is appropriately serious and rich, with tight tannins and acidity. Underneath the structure, the red currant fruits promise some freshness.
The Daou brothers have become increasingly known for their rich, unctuous and lavish high-end wines, but this bottling offers a taste of that opulence for just $30. Plump blueberry and soft, cedar-like spice scents show on the nose, while the palate bursts with black cherry, dark chocolate and caramel flavors, powered by ample acidity. It will age gracefully, but is already delicious.
Although 2006 won't go down as a great vintage in the northern Rhône, Chapoutier's selections parcellaires are still top notch. Le Méal gets the nod this year as the most powerful of the group, with massive espresso and black olive elements tinged with meat and underlain by a bed of ripe blueberries. Long and mouthwatering on the finish, look for this wine to approach maturity by 2016; drink well through 2025 or longer.
You'll find solid blackberry, black currant, herb and oak flavors in this Cabernet, but the texture is rough and hot, with weird acidity.
This smells like red roses were muddled with Dr. Pepper and a slice of dark cherry pie. From the start, the palate feels soft and pliable, with mild tannins adding a subtle, dusty texture. A hint of cherry chapstick marks the finish.
The bouquet on this blend of Cabernet, Merlot and Syrah is toasty and elevated, a clear invitation to dig in. In the mouth, the flow is silky smooth and just snappy enough, with finely etched acidity pushing raspberry, plum, herb and cocoa flavors. This is excellent in every way; drink now–2018.
Tight, minerally aromas of charred oak, vanilla, toast, black cherry and cassis carry an herbal note. A fresh, juicy, layered palate shows controlled rawness, with classic Chilean flavors of spice, green herbs, mint and mixed black fruits. A peppery, blackened finish with toasty, herbal blackberry flavors suggests this is built to last. Drink through 2023.
Aromas of white flowers are light yet clean. This feels basic, while the flavors are greener and more pyrazinic than the nose indicates, especially on the finish, which tastes of bell pepper and white fruits.
With a vivid mousse, this ripe wine shows tannic structure as well as bright red berries. It is lively with a touch of spice as well as acidity. The aftertaste is soft and ripe from the relatively high dosage.
This is a hugely structured and concentrated wine, the double plusses marked on barrel selections meant to call out the best of the best. Herbal, it offers complex characteristics of dried herb, cedar and leather, with a big grip of tannin tenacious on the palate and peppery finish.
Angular, slightly sweaty aromas let you know up front that this is Sauvignon Blanc. In the mouth, it's a bit soft and short on acidity. Flavors of mango, banana and brown sugar finish with candied sweetness and a shot of bitterness.
Pretty and floral, this is a field blend of Gewürztraminer, Trousseau Gris, Riesling and other mixed whites, all farmed by organic guru Phil Coturri. Full-figured and lithe, it lingers in fruit sweetness, the right call as an apéritif with spicy nuts, but especially with chips and guacamole or any other piquant fare.
Fresh and floral, this informal wine delivers red berry flavors lightly accented with notes of white pepper. Zesty acidity and supple tannins make it very accessible. Pair it with your favorite pizza or pasta topped with tomato sauce.
Open and seductive, this has upfront notes of oak backed by moderate red apple, pear and faint herb accents. Medium weight, with a flinty streak, the palate is bright and mouthwatering, closing on a toasty, orange rind flavor.
Sweet with brown-sugar aromas, but the nose lacks more than that. Citrus and other sweet aromas are solid but common, while the feel is good and the finish brings back brown sugar and mocha. Standard; not designed for complexity.
Don Lorenzi is making a strong case for growing cool climate-loving Chardonnay in the hot Temecula Valley. This clonal study delivers honeysuckle, marzipan and lemon curd aromas, while the palate offers richer notes of buttered apple and poached pear. Although ripe in style, it's cut by a zesty lemon-like acidity.
Lovely aromas, with the depth and dimension that old vine (30-year-old) Riesling can produce. This is ripe, round and well-defined, and packed with stone and citrus fruits, especially grapefruit. Great natural acidity and balance.
Using fruit sourced from some of the rare chalk soils in Beaujolais, this soft, floral Chardonnay shows yellow and citrus fruits. There is just a hint of mineral, and it's an attractive wine for early drinking.
Though already four years old, this blend of 77% Zinfandel and 23% Petite Sirah shows lots of promise for a long-lasting wine. Complicated aromas of tobacco and ripe boysenberries become sagebrush herbs on the palate, bolstered by blueberry and elderberry fruits. The tannic grip is still strong, so drink 2018–2028.
Oaky, concentrated black-fruit aromas feature notes of graphite and savory earth. This Monastrell is deep, jammy and textured on a full-bodied palate. Spicy oak and black-plum flavors finish toasty, with hints of baking spices and dried herbs. Drink through 2019.
Like its stablemate Pinot Grigio from producer Thorne Clark, this Pinot Gris carries a faint copper-pink cast to its hue, and it also has a fairly broad mouthfeel. The pear and melon flavors are pleasant, making it an easy-drinking medium-bodied white with wide appeal.
As good as the winery's other 2008s are, this wine raises the stakes. It's bone dry, deeply tannic and marked by classic varietal flavors of blackberries, cassis and dark chocolate, with sweet, smoky oak. Almost a food group in itself for its complexity, it's dazzling now for its sheer luxurious deliciousness, yet is guaranteed to develop over at least the next 10 years.
For a Grand Cru from Vosne-Romanée, this is a wine on the light side, its tannins soft and dominated by new-wood flavors. That said, it is still a fine wine, packed with ripe fruit and fresh acidity. The structure floats over the fruit; a few months and it may fatten out.
Sweet spice and dark fruit aromas offer all the telltale signs of a top-notch riserva. The wine is bright with etched acidity and strong tannins. Let it age 10 years or more. Defined, compact mouthfeel.
This wine is soft and rounded with attractive red-cherry fruits, ripe strawberries and touches of wood and tannin. Acidity comes along behind this richness. It is going to develop quickly and will give great pleasure. Drink from 2018.
This is a dry, hot, rustic Zinfandel, with a burn of alcohol. But it's rich in cherry and berry, currant, licorice, smoked meat and pepper spice flavors. Has lots of popular appeal.
Shows an herbal, tobacco and mushroom edge to the sour red cherry and pomegranate fruit, in a lightly delicate, dry mouthfeel. With its coat of furry, peppery tannins, this young Pinot needs time. It's a good example of a less-ripe, but very elegant, style. Best after 2011.
Aromas of cocoa, applesauce, red plum and mild toast travel to the palate. The acidity gives the wine an overall feel of cleanliness and juiciness.
There's a nice weight and intensity to this wine, especially for a grape that is often deemed innocuous and light. Apple and pear skin tones offer tension to the fuzzy-textured palate, with a vein of citrus keeping everything in focus.
Just a splash of Chenin Blanc has been added to the blend, adding some lift to the aromas and suggestions of citrus blossom. The natural herbaceousness of Sauvignon Blanc has been kept in check, but the wine is clean and varietal. The flavors seem just a bit muted, almost thin, but it's a perfectly refreshing, if simple effort.
A step up from the somewhat simple 2002 version of this wine, the 2003 Bullrush Merlot boasts ample weight on the palate and a long finish to go with its expansive black cherry flavors shot through with dried herbs. Imported by Foster's Wine Estates Americas.
Though not indicated on the label, this is sourced from a single vineyard in the Columbia Gorge AVA. Cool-site flavors abound, from the lemony fruit to the snappy acidity. The wine did not go through secondary malolactic fermentation, yet shows a tasty streak of butterscotch running through its core.
A wine that blends fruit from seven vineyards and seven clones, this bears a family resemblance to the more expensive Balistreri Vineyard bottling in its tart, crisp profile, although there's some dark earth and cola notes layered over the pie cherry fruit.
Shows enormous complexity of flavor, a wine that really impresses for its myriad blackberry, cherry, currant, cola, grilled meat, sautéed mushroom, violet and chocolate flavors. If the structure were more firm, it would be a perfect wine. But this is Paso Robles, where the wines will always be soft. A blend of Syrah and Petite Sirah.
Typical in some ways for 2003, this is a soft, cuddly Riesling that boasts modest pear, apple and melon flavors. Plump and easy to drink over the short term. Imported by Slocum & Sons, Inc.
With many Champy reds, the high toast extract is just a hint. Here it dominates. While there is acidity and a bitter cherry flavor, it is hard to discern through the barrier of wood. Maybe two or three years will help, but it is a question.
Made with organically farmed fruit, this opens with aromas of ripe plum, tilled earth, leather and spice. The dense, warm palate delivers crushed blackberry, blueberry extract, oak, black pepper, espresso and cinnamon alongside big, velvety tannins. It's flamboyant but it's shy on freshness and the burn of searing alcohol throws it off balance.
This is an offbeat Spumante Rosato (made from a blend of Montepulciano, Sagrantino, Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon) packaged in a beautifully rimmed keepsake bottle. The contents offers tart flavors of almond, wild berry and cranberry.
Apple and citrus aromas struggle to hold it together. Citrusy acids control the palate, yielding grapefruit, orange and pithy flavors. Feels unruly. Sauvignon, Sémillon, Chenin Blanc and Viognier.
This medium-sweet wine has an attractively honeyed character and fragrant, spicy fruit. There's also a fine lift of acidity, giving some brightness to an otherwise rich wine.
Starts out with distinct candied aromas of milk chocolate-covered raspberry or cherry, which is fine in a drugstore candy sampler but not great in a wine bottle. Things settle and darken up on the palate, where there's racy red berry fruit and minerally notes. Coffee, mocha and sweet oak are most prominent on the finish.
Scads of sweet, fresh raspberries and cherries on this forward, fruity young wine. It's crisp in acidity and dry, with a lush coating of smoky oak. Would benefit from a little more earthiness, as the fruit is so powerful.
Broad and ripe, this comes across heavy on the nose, with fig and chocolate cake aromas. The palate is huge and tannic but also jammy. Fig, baked berry and tobacco flavors finish hot and toasty, like espresso.
This wine has overlapping personalities. One drips richly in vanilla and honey, while the other is lemony tart and electric in acidity. They commingle on the finish, and will clearly decide whether to get along or part over time. Give the wine a good swirl.
A structured, crisp and mineral-driven wine, this merely hints at raspberry flavors but is dedicated to a steely character. That suggests youth, and the wine, with its tense texture, could well age over several more years. For now, this is an impressive wine that demands pairing with food.
Still hard and tannic, this big-boned Cabernet from the Champoux Vineyard is bursting with the vineyard's characteristic black cherry fruit. Hints of herb and dried leaf sneak in, but the tannin and alcohol will need some years of bottle age to smooth out.
Citrus and crushed stone notes start this wine off, followed by lemon sorbet on the palate. It's lightweight, a real summertime refresher, with a short, clean finish.
Berry, cola and chocolate aromas are pretty. In the mouth, this wine is bright and brash, with rough tannins and high acidity. Flavors of plum and wild berry are a touch salty and then comes a hard-pounding finish. Drink through 2026.
Black cherry, blueberry, pepper spice and a touch of toasted pine shows on the nose of this bottling. There is juniper spice and baked cherry on the palate, which is relatively simply yet flavorful.
It is difficult to find a blend this good from the region in Walla Walla known as The Rocks District for less than $30. Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot, Malbec and Syrah are combined resulting in a deeply-flavored wine with blue and black fruits, licorice and a streak of scrumptious caramel. A super value, and just plain delicious.
This bottling, which is already good but shows potential to be great, eschews overly obvious fruit aromas to instead deliver notes of peppercorns, pencil shavings and green bell pepper. The palate is powered by a lively bitterness of underripe raspberries, raw coffee beans and more green peppers, yet will probably age better than most of its vintage counterparts. Drink 2018–2024.
Aromas of charred earth, underbrush and roasted coffee beans lead the nose of this blend of 50% Sangiovese, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot and 10% Petit Verdot. The palate offers dried black cherries, prunes, clove, anise and tobacco set in a framework of tightly woven tannins. Drink 2016–2021.
Vanilla, cherry and violet on the nose lead into flavors of black fruit, spices and pepper in this balanced, crisp red. Complex but refreshing, with a food-friendly character. Pair with lamb, cheeses.
Pleasant and fairly clean for the price, with hazelnut, honey and a dusting of talcum powder on the nose. The palate is on the thin side, and that helps the wine stay fresh and manageable. And along the way the flavors of apple, kiwi and gooseberry are relaxed and easy.
Too oaky for my tastes, this wine brims with spicy, smoky new-woody flavors and woodsap sweetness that overshadow the fruit. Aren't we past the toothpick stage?
Crisp and glossy, this refreshing, stainless-steel Sauvignon Blanc has the appropriate varietal flavors of fresh herb, sweet grass, lime and grapefruit. The flavors of citrus and herb are in perfect balance and complement each other perfectly.
You'll find ripe, sweet pineapple, peach and pear fruit in this wine, as well as crisp Carneros acidity. But the oak has been heavily applied, with overpowering buttered toast and caramel flavors.
Attractive, fruity and round, this offers tangy acidity, fresh apple and citrus fruits and a full texture. It is floral and aromatic—a wine that will be ready to drink in the next year.
Made from all five classic Bordeaux varieties, this wine is overripe. Although it's dry and the tannins are fine, it's dominated by raisiny flavors.
This bottling has been spotty and vintage-driven, but the '06 is a good wine. Soft and oaky, it has pleasant flavors of black and red cherry pie filling, cola, violets and mint, with a touch of smoky oak. Drink now.
With an opaque brick color and notes of toasty French oak, this wine announces its lofty ambitions. The fruit is subsumed by the oak right now but there is enough stuffing here to warrant aging for several years to allow for more integration. Smooth tannins suggest a lighter meat dish such as shepherd's pie.
Very light yellow in the glass, with light floral/fresh meadow aromas to match. White meat and pear fruit is weighty on the front palate, and fades into a bright herbal-steeliness on the finish. Not hugely fat or mouthcoating. It's just the right size, and rather interesting at that.
A pretty, polished and simple wine that shows the buttery creaminess, toast, popcorn and pineapple jam flavors people like. Easy to find, with more than 17,000 cases produced.
Fermented entirely in stainless steel, Ocel is doughy and dark-golden in color, and despite its lack of barrel influence, the nose is ripe. On the palate, it finds its balance, showing off an abundance of apple and pear along with juicy acidity.
White spring flower, citrus and a whiff of tomato leaf lead the nose. Bright and linear, the palate offers juicy white grapefruit, pineapple and a hint of mineral alongside tangy acidity.
This Zin just needed a bit more spice to shake things up, but the dark concentrated fruit aromas and flavors are definitely there by way of rich berry preserves and black plum guts. Accents of foliage add interest to the bouquet, and fine tannins coupled with a mouthwatering finish make it very easy to drink.
No visible vintage date on the bottle, but the winery says it's a 2001. Tart and lemony, with crisp acids, it tends toward bland, with simple, green apple fruit.
A fuller-bodied wine with round, cidery aromas and a whack of wood resin. The palate is spherical and honeyed, with apple, pineapple and nectarine flavors. For Argentinean Chardonnay it's well made and respectable, but at $20 it's not going to turn many heads.
This is a pretty Pinot Grigio with a slight amber tint to its color and fresh notes of citrus, stone fruit, melon and honey. The wine delivers medium structure and persistency and would pair well with white meat or pasta.
The Chardonnay in this blend dominates, giving a rich, generous feel to the wine, full of ripe plum and peach flavors. The Arinto provides fresh acidity that is behind the warm fruits. Full and generous, it is a wine that needs to age; drink from the end of 2016.
Rich, dense and concentrated, with juicy currant, cherry, mocha and sweet fresh herb flavors. Well-oaked, this wine is impeccably made and generous in the mouth, and maintains a firm structure.
Soft, ripe and fruity, this is an immediately attractive wine. Melon, pear and apricots come together in a fruit cocktail of a lively, crisp texture. Drink now.
This bottling by Josh Jensen shows sharp aromas of black plum and blackberry, with hints of lilacs. The palate combines a strong earthy quality with gravelly minerality, rose petals, lavender and dark cranberry fruit. Tannins are a bit rigid this early in this wine's life, so wait for the mellowing. Drink 2018–2034.
High-toned aromas of potpourri, herb and white pepper lead to plump pleasing fruit flavors. It brings a slightly tacky feel, with the finish coming up a bit short.
The nose isn't very expressive but eventually reveals subdued aromas of dried rose, raisin, leather, truffle and a whiff of dark spice. Showing the heat of the vintage, the palate is somewhat evolved, offering dried wild cherry, espresso, vanilla anise and toasted oak alongside drying tannins that leave an astringent finish. Drink through 2021.
Light on both flavors and aromas, this is just the style of wine you'll want as an apéritif or with seafood. Light citrus aromas are followed up by firm white stone fruit flavors and a crisp, lean mouthfeel. Plumps up a bit on the finish.
Firm and structured, this is a textured wine, its tannins currently showing strongly. The blueberry fruit flavors offer a juicy, friendly contrast, resulting in a balanced wine that will benefit from a year or two of aging.
Shows the dry tannins and herbal quality that so often mark Dry Creek Cabs, but that also distinguish it as unique. You'll find black currant and cherry flavors awash in sage, tobacco, black pepper and even Chinese five-spice notes. The tannins are firm, but smooth, suggesting moderate ageability.
Ripe berry aromas arrive accented with baking spices, toasted notes and espresso. The soft, round palate delivers mature black plum, black cherry and vanilla alongside bracing tannins. Superior Wines, Quintessential Wines.
I haven't been a fan of the winery's Pinot Noirs, and this release doesn't change my mind. It's simple and slightly sweet-tasting, with baked cherry pie and coffee flavors and a heavy overlay of toast.
A good Pinot Noir for everyday drinking. It's very dry and crisp and silky in the mouth, with complex flavors of cherries, cola, licorice and beef jerky. The acidity suggests rich, oily fare, like lamb or salmon.
The Selezione Vigna La Casa is equally sweet and ripe as the estate's base Brunello from the same vintage. What distinguishes this wine, however, is the firmness of its structure and the grainy texture of its tannins.
Aromas of dried black-skinned fruit, cedar, charred earth and ground pepper lead the nose. The palate offers dried black cherry, ripe blackberry, clove, allspice and tobacco alongside fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2018.
A racy, rich and vital Pinot Noir, whose tart acidity and delicate structure testify to its cool coastal origin. The grapes were grown in a small vineyard close to the Pacific. You can taste the fog and wind that wind through the raspberry, cherry and cola flavors. Drink now-2015.
89-91 Barrel sample. A ripe, soft wine, showing the caramel flavors of new wood as well big, blackberry fruits. It is certainly a ripe wine, which shows through well in the fresh juicy aftertaste.
A blend of roughly equal parts Mourvèdre and Syrah, this does not offer much in the way of fruit; there's an emptiness to the midpalate. It's a difficult wine to get a handle on, even after breathing time. Perhaps more bottle age will open it up.
Shows plenty of Petite Sirah character in the dry, hard tannins and flavors of blackberries and pepper, while oak barrel aging adds a richer touch. Could be crisper and more complex, but a sound wine for drinking with barbecue.
In color, this wine is virtually black, with a deep-red rim, while aromas are concentrated and dense. Flavors recall blackberry syrup, yet are nicely dry. Despite its full body and thick coating of tannins, the wine's texture feels polished and all the elements are in balance.
This light, pleasant quaffer has apple, green melon and hint of pineapple in the mix. The barrel fermentation adds a dusting of toast as a welcome accent. This is not a particularly complex or powerful wine, but will quench your thirst admirably when you're up for something not too heavy.
This wine is rich and dense, with dusty tannins suspended in the powerful texture. Firm at the core, this is a black-plum driven wine that has fine acidity and a juicy aftertaste. It is concentrated and likely to remain so with its dark, brooding finish. Drink from 2017.
Very tannic and gritty now. Shuts the fruit down with a dry, sandpapery astringency. But what great fruit. It's rich in blackberries, black cherries, currants, licorice and mocha, and is bone dry. Could and should age, but there's a certain sharpness that makes you wonder.
Easy to like for its fruity, flowery flavors and crisp acidity, this wine has extra layers of complexity. It feels as rich as honey in the mouth, yet is fundamentally dry. Nice with poultry, veal or fish with a fruity salsa topping.
This aromatic and fruity wine is ripe and full of peach and pear flavor. The wine balances nicely between crisp fruitiness and a more rounded, full-bodied texture. Clean, fresh, soft and ready to drink. Glass stopper.
There are pruny, raisiny notes in the aroma, faintly Port-like, and this impression of super-maturity is confirmed in the mouth. It's a big, hot, dense wine with Porty flavors, but is dry.  Not for everyone, but fans out of this style will cheer.
A round and spicy Merlot. Dark plum and blackberry flourish while fleeting nuances of tobacco glimmer on the medium-length finish. The silky texture and soft tannins are sure to please those with a gentler palate.
Always one of Napa's best Fumé (Sauvignon) Blancs, Mondavi's basic bottling is so good, it tastes like it has some grapes from the famed Tokalon Vineyard. It's a rich, pure wine, brimming with gooseberry, fig, green melon and white pepper flavors, accented with zesty acidity. Great food wine, and a bargain at this price.
Ripe blackberry, smoked pork and black sage aromas show on the nose of this blend of 51% Grenache, 45% Syrah and 4% Mourvèdre. There is lots of energy on the sip, with lighter olallieberry flavors mixing with savory teriyaki, black peppercorn and Sichuan pepper spice.
A totally refreshing blend of citrus, apple, peach and pear flavors, all couched in bright textured acidity. The wine makes a fine aperitif as well as a mealtime beverage. Off dry, but hardly sweet, it's crisp and fresh to the end.
Tough and gritty, this is an everyday Cabernet. It's full-bodied and dry, with some green flavors.
A blend of 55% Petit Verdot, 25% Cabernet Franc and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon, this opens with raspberry, black plum, orange zest and cocoa aromas that follow through to the full-bodied palate. Polished tannins lend a smooth, creamy texture. Enjoy through 2021.
For a Listrac, this is soft and open, a generous wine that has weight while showing ripe Merlot character. Full black plum skin flavors go with spice, licorice and touches of wood. It's ready to drink now.
Softly floral and brightly spicy, this wine rocks in red cherry and tangy citrus, sure to please a broad range of palates in its approachable elegance and restraint. Toasted vanilla oak rounds out the finish.
Butterscotch, butter, honey and roasted-peanut aromas lead to similar boisterous flavors in this extremely rich and full-bodied wine from Rhône-style winemaker Bill Easton. It's so ripe and luxurious that it almost tastes sweet. Aged cheese should make a great pairing.
Smoky, herbal aromas, a tannic mouthfeel and austere flavors like unsweetened cranberries characterize this deliberately taut wine. It might soften with time, but it's tough to discern if the fruit character can sustain long-term aging.
This wine is rich and gently textured with acidity under the red-berry fruits. Hints of fruit tannins balance the essentially juicy character of the wine. Drink from the end of 2015. Most of the Les Merrains grapes come from the Ferraud family estate in Vaux en Beaujolais.
Rusty in color and earthy on the nose, with capped aromas of cedar and herbs, this mature Catalonian Cabernet is compact on the palate and fused by firm tannins. Flavors of dried berry, stone fruits and toffee finish long. This ranks as a fun challenge for Spanish wine geeks.
Even better than the ‘98, an elegant, harmonious wine, long in rich, sweet cherry fruit. Great balance and style. Feels supple and smooth, with great acidity. Char and vanilla stand out on the finish. Dazzling now, and should improve and hold for a decade.
An elegant, rich wine that shows off its red fruit and light tannins well against a backdrop of red apple acidity. The wine is well balanced, its fruit lying well with some toast and yeast, leaving a bone-dry freshness.
A smoky narcissus note is upfront and almost obtrusive, with brooding notes of spiced black fruit and char lurking in the background. The tannins are drying—with the consistency of finely ground sand—and they constrict the flavors a bit. A food wine for sure, it needs to be paired with a slab of rare meat.
Delicate morello cherry and tart red plums perfume this bright, lifted Pinot Noir. The palate is anchored by a crush of cranberry acidity and a rippling core of granite. It's a refined, exceptionally balanced wine edged by feather-soft tannins. Drink now through 2020.
A floral, ripe and full of sweet yellow-fruit flavors, this is round, with its softness balanced by some acidity. Flavors of green plum skins and apples add tang.
This rosé comes with a peachy, stone-fruited scent. The palate is taut and fresh, with a little spritz that further accentuates its lemony freshness. The peachy character makes another appearance on the fresh, dry finish.
Black-plum and apple-skin aromas are fruity and a bit raw. In the mouth, this blend of Cabernet Franc, Syrah, Carmenère and Petit Verdot is full, properly tannic and loamy in feel. Dark-leaning flavors of licorice, peppery spice, chocolate and herbs finish with classic Chilean notes of black olive and tobacco. Drink through 2019.
Aromas of citrus and rose petal lead to flavors of lemon-lime sorbet, pear and Turkish delight. Very soft tannins brush across the side palate, followed by a bright and refreshing close. Mevushal.
Aromas of white fruit and citrus lead, followed by semi-sweet tropical fruit and citrus flavors with a touch of acidity. Fresh-tasting and friendly, this makes for a great summer sip. Serve with Asian cuisine, grilled foods.
Erath's Leland Pinot Noir is among the lightest of the 2007 designates, a clear and pale wine with an elegance that is almost rosé-like. Soft scents of crushed roses and hints of mocha lead into a mouthful of nougat wafer and almond paste flavors, wrapped around sweet cherry fruit.
Watery and thin, a citrusy wine whose mouthfeel is mainly alcohol and peppery heat. The flavors veer toward grapefruits and lemons, and the finish is dry and watery.
This 90th anniversary edition boasts enticing aromas of baked plum, crushed violet, new leather, French oak and a whiff of pipe tobacco. The firm concentrated palate presents layers of dried blackberry, black cherry extract, licorice and cake spice framed in assertive fine-grained tannins. Give it a few more years to fully develop. Drink through 2018–2026.
Crisp, natural and lightly salinic on the nose, with medium weight, good freshness and solid peach and citrus flavors. This is a standard but nicely done Rioja rosé with a pithy finish and just the right edge to it. Drink liberally with appetizers and you shouldn't go wrong.
Coming from the series of single-varietal wines produced by this estate, this wine adds a southern warmth to the crispness and elegant green-fruit flavors of the Alvarinho. It is tangy, hinting at minerality and with a zesty aftertaste. Drink now.
This wine comes in with a low, unheard-of (in Washington) 12.2% alcohol. The aromas offer reticent and unusual notes of wheat, lemongrass, tobacco, vanilla and herbs while the flavors are tart and supple. It doesn't seem outright underripe but comes off as faint.
Coconut is the lead aroma, but there's graphite, cool earth, cola, blackberry and raw oak on the bouquet. Feels structured and lush, with tight tannins and robust flavors of clove, coconut, blackberry and tobacco. Quite oaky late, with barrel-driven flavors driving the finish.
This is a dark, dry and tannic wine, even at the age of five-plus years. It even shows some austerity, with a cloak of astringency. Nearly all Syrah, it has a massive core of blackberry jam, licorice, bacon and sandalwood, with a pleasantly funky note of what seems like brettanomyces. A drop of Viognier lends crisp acidity to this wonderfully rich wine. Now–2013.
A powerful Zin that shows the effusively brawny, muscular character of the variety, but keeps its poise all the way. Call it rustic-chic. Fully dry and very high in alcohol, it explodes with red and black currants, mocha, blackstrap molasses, black pepper and Asian spices.
Extraordinarily high alcohol is the defining reality of this wine. It gives it a burn in the mouth, like cognac, only without the richness. The currant and spice flavors are nicely dry, but that high alcohol accentuates the tannins.
While the wine is rich, it does show a more austere side, with tight acidity balancing superripe fruit tones. Big berry flavors are contrasted by ripe tannins and a chalky, firm texture. This wine might need to age, so drink after 2015.
Intensely perfumed, this wine has soft tannins and a smooth, red-fruit-dominated texture. From a 3.5-acre premier-cru vineyard, it is ripe while light in character, suggesting it will age smoothly and quickly. The wine is almost ready now, although it will be best from 2018.
This is a confounding wine in many ways, one that could have easily scored higher, or scored lower. It starts with an almost alarming taste of vanilla and cherry coke and a slight bite of alcohol, but over time, got much more interesting. Finally, it turned earthy with pleasant hits of olive and caramel competing for dominance.
A pleasantly crisp, fruity Sauvignon Blanc for drinking now as a cocktail or with simple fare. It's sweet in jammy pineapples, oranges and limes.
With a good dry tang, this is a delicious Vinho Verde full of citrus and green apple flavors, as bright and breezy as the climate of Portugal's northern Minho region. Screwcap.
La Casa dell'Orco offers an interesting interpretation of Fiano that is slightly bigger and fatter than most. This golden wine opens with aromas of mature fruit, melon, apricot and a spicy touch of freshly cut grass at the very end. It moves smoothly over the mouth and shows medium intensity.
This opens with ripe, almost jammy, notes of strawberry and black cherry followed by sweet almond and spice scents. There's a touch of sweetness on the close that's backed by a plush, succulent mouthfeel.
The Amador Zin specialist is offering its first ever Grenache here, a tremendous debut, super light in color and texture, lightly rendered to show off its layers of delicate violet and raspberry amid a meatier backbone of lurking anise and herbs. With 9% Mourvedre and 5% Syrah, this is a light red worth seeking out.
Celery and watermelon flavors give this pale pink, medium-bodied wine an herbal character. With a good balance between crispness and smoothness, it tastes refeshing and leaves a lingering finish.
Hard and spiky on the nose, and not a whole lot better in the mouth. The flavors are tart and juicy, while the lean finish is ultratangy and sharp.
This is rough and gritty smelling, with burnt, stalky berry aromas. It feels straightforward, with rubbery-tasting berry flavors that lead to a sweet, warm finish.
This is a lightly textured wine that has red berry flavors, spice and lively acidity. It is sweet, rich and generous in character, with red fruit, black currant and fine, well-integreated acidity.
A disappointing effort, showing a weedy, hay-like profile and fruit that is drying out on the finish. Barely acceptable.
Here's a round Sauvignon with subdued aromas of ripe tropical fruit, peach and cut grass. The mellow palate delivers papaya and pineapple accented with a note of paprika alongside fresh acidity.
Cherry and spice aromas are fairly oaky and resiny. The palate is also resiny, with drying wood tannins along with clove and generic berry and cherry flavors. Tastes peppery and also like a clove-infused barrel on the finish.
This has a solidly built, almost chunky style, with generous fruit flavors of melon and pear. A light wash of toast comes from aging in 20% new French oak.
Filled with bouncy aromas of melon, pear and tropical fruit, this lightweight charmer even blends in notes of butter and anise on the finish. It's a fun wine with the accent on fruit. Best Buy.
Provenance released their regular ‘04 Merlot a few months ago, and this is a riper, more expensive wine, but it can't quite overcome a certain rusticity. It's a little sweet and cherry cough mediciney, with sticky tannins.
Balanced and fruity, this is a crisp wine that has soft tannins. With its bright black-currant fruit, acidity, and touch of spice, it is ready to drink.
Funky and odd smelling, with exotic aromas that are unfamiliar and not that inviting. Feels thick and soupy, with black fruit flavors, cumin, candy and some bitterness on the finish.
Not as intense as other Tolaini wines, this Sangiovese (with 15% Merlot) doles out measured portions of prune, plum, black cherry, leather, resin and tobacco. In the mouth, it has cherry flavors, dense tannins and a long finish.
Peach and powdered sugar aromas are first up, followed by a round palate with oily weight but also zesty acidity. Racy citrus and nectarine flavors finish full and chunky, with a pithy note.
This producer's vines are in the Sézanne region, south of Epernay. With a high proportion of Pinot Meunier in the vineyard, it has produced a ripe, oak fermented wine that has obtained its color from the grape skins (rather than the usual Champagne practice of adding red wine). It is a dark colored rosé, one that is dry, with crisp red currant fruits and plenty of acidity. Drink now.
Whereas once Ochoa produced some of Navarra's best rosés, lately the wines have been marginal. This is awkward, with aromas of chemicals and rubber gloves. The palate is wan in flavor and feel, while the finish tastes burnt and medicinal.
This is a super-fresh, fruity wine meant to dazzle in sheer deliciousness now, not something to age. It's almost candied, with raspberry, cherry, blackberry and mocha flavors that are exuberant and easy to understand.
Bright cherry, pepper and spice aromas lead on this flavorful red. Fruity flavors of cherry and plum are laced with pepper. Vibrant and fun—and food friendly. Think duck or a meat lasagna.
From the famous maker of Cristal comes a truly lovely, ripe bottle of bubbly, bursting with buttered, roasted nuts and lemony fruit. The Brut Premier spends a little extra time in bottle before being released. It makes for a forward, lush and just plain delicious style of Champagne rather than one that is especially complex or elegant. If anything, this bottle will put you in a boisterous mood and keep any party hardy.
The '07 release of this wine, a blend of four considerable vineyards, was great. This 2008 is less so, although it's still a fine wine. Packed with cherry, cola and spice flavors, it's a little raw in the mouth. Decant for a few hours before drinking.
A dark colored red that is firmly tannic as well as ripe and fruity. The wine is spicy and earthy, redolent of dried fruits, like figs and red berries. With its solid texture, it can age; drink from 2015.
Saffron and orange rind lend spicy zest to honey and floral tones on this gorgeously rich auslese. It's luscious, with sweet yellow peach and caramel flavors, but struck with a clean line of tangerine acidity. Bold and powerful in concentration, it finishes with just a hint of tea-leaf astringency.
This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon is distinct in herb and peppercorn, the red fruit warm and juicy. Layered and soft, it's approachable and ready to enjoy now.
Very light in color, this wine brings appealing aromas of white pepper, smoked meat, orange peel, herb, earth and sauvage. The palate is ethereally light and delicate, showing pleasing nuances, with plenty of floral flavors on the finish.
As with all Ayoub wines, the immaculate fruit and impeccable structure impress the most. Deep flavors of strawberry and raspberry are set in a toasty frame, with underlying minerality. The finish is drying and extends for well over a minute.
Initially you get nothing but herbs, spice and tomato off this Bordeaux blend. The nose deals bell pepper, red pepper flake and tomato such that it smells more like chimichurri than wine. But with airing it improves to reveal dry strawberry, cherry and herbal spice flavors. More saucy, green and savory than fruity, and probably past its prime; but still it's offering some mature class and style.
Once again, Clos Apalta distinguishes itself as one of Chile's best wines. The bouquet is dark and slightly minty, with licorice, shoe polish and ripe, herb-tinged black fruit. Saturated and deep in the mouth, with cola, cassis, black cherry and blackberry flavors. Chewy wine; still has some oak to resolve. Best from 2011.
Ripe, juicy pear scents make for an inviting nose. The wine's concentrated palate presents ample citrus with those pear notes, as well as spicy grapefruit zestiness. This is lovely, dry, refreshing and focused.
Tea, spice, tomato and dried-fruit aromas feed into a lightweight palate with slightly raw acidity. Snappy flavors of red currant and plum are clean, fresh and light. In a nutshell, that's what this Tupungato Pinot is about: freshness, femininity and dried red fruits. Drink through 2019.
Black cherry pie, milk chocolate and lilacs combine for a very accessible and rather lavish nose on this blend of 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Cabernet Franc and 10% Merlot. It's easy to like on the sip, with candied purple fruit and licorice spice flavors, proving very fruity, lush and quaffable.
89-91 Barrel sample. A big wine, with intense dark tannins and great concentration. This is a wine of power, somewhat rough around the edges. To finish, great juiciness.
Wet slate, cinnamon and allspice notes meet with red cherry, baked black cherry and bramble on the nose of this bottling from a popular single-vineyard source. Clay and chalky earth notes show on the palate, which is very full and rich with tart cherry, black plum and pencil-lead flavors.
Made using organically-farmed Primitivo grapes, this features aromas of licorice, crushed granite and candied fruit. The acidity is bright and lively.
Blackberry, cassis and floral aromas are the lead actors on a musky nose. This ripe Malbec feels thick and syrupy, while rich flavors of blackberry, cassis, chocolate and mocha finish smooth but shy. For such a big wine, this is light on tannic bite. Drink through 2021.
Just 38 cases produced. The fruit is sourced from the Seven Hills vineyards, and the blend is a “super-Walla-Wallan” with 60% Sangiovese, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Cab Franc. Light and somewhat unfocused, it has some characteristic high tones, a suggestion of anise and a bit of toasty oak in the finish.
Grapes are sourced from both Stagecoach and Hyde vineyards in this wine that takes its time in the glass coming around. Funky brine and a tropical flourish open on the nose with a severity of oak that mellows slowly. Made in an opulent, full-bodied style, it'll pair well with buttery fare.
This blend of 75% Barbera and 25% Merlot smells and tastes of strawberries in dirt, a strange sensation for a wine.
Maison Bouachon is an old négociant house based in Gigondas. It's now owned by the Skalli family who is trying to raise the level of the wines. This Côtes-du-Rhône cuvée is a promising effort, boasting plenty of black cherry fruit to go with hints of leather and game. The fruit shows a hint of sur-maturité, yet remains fresh, while the mouthfeel is round yet not unstructured. Drink now–2010, possibly longer.
One sniff and you will be able to peg this as cool-climate SB. The nose is full of nettle and gooseberry aromas, while the palate feels trim and citrusy. Flavors of gooseberry, nettle and green bean leave a tropical note on the finish. This shows fine acidity but narrow, raw flavors.
With a typical cream and spice flavor, this rich Pinot Blanc is soft and flavored with ripe mirabelle and pear flavors. It is ready to drink, warm and accessible.
Timid but clean as a whistle on the nose, with apple and vanilla aromas along with a sprinkling of talcum powder. The palate is lively and fresh, with flavors of pineapple, lemon and other tropical hints. Entirely pedestrian as cava goes, but 100% clean and refreshing.
This ambitious, impressively structured wine will appeal to those who run from wines made in the fruit-bomb style. The subdued nose has earthy notes, while the palate is all about minerals and green pepper. A year or two in the cellar will allow the grippy tannins to integrate.
Fresh and light aromas of lemongrass, Pink Lady apples, guava soda and a hint of pineapple make for a slightly tropical but clean approach to this bottling. It's fresh on the sip with spritzy acidity and more tropical flavors of guava, mango, pineapple and tuberose.
There's an orchard of fruit in this dry, smooth wine. The flavors range from blackberries and plums to cherries, with slightly bitter coffee notes. The tannins and acids stick out a bit now. Try holding until mid-2006.
Pithy citrus and nectarine aromas announce a palate that's citrusy all the way. Flavors of orange, lemon and grapefruit keep a persistent citric character through the finish, which is basic but refreshing.
A touch of wood helps the wine's light fruit to deepen and become richer. The wine is well balanced, with fresh acidity giving a good lift.
A robust blend of 38% Zinfandel, 23% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Petite Sirah, 11% Barbera and 11% Syrah, all grown in Lake County, this rightly named Non Typical red is rich in strawberry and raspberry flavors with dusty overtones. Structured, but soft in the mouth, with a caramel finish.
With its perfumed aromas, this is a wine that has richness and sweetness, with soft velvet power. It has an intense wood element that needs to blend into the rest of the wine, but the sweet black currant and freshness provide a good balance. This is a seductive wine, with a fine solid character.
Situated at the mouth of the Pinhão River in the heart of the Douro vineyards, the steep slopes of this quinta are a prominent landmark. The wine is dark and dense, made to age with its firm tannins and concentrated black fruit flavors. Structured and still very firm, it will age well. Drink from 2018.
It's all about simple, jammy cherry and blackberry, brown sugar and sweet oak flavors for this Zin. But it has a wonderful tannin-acid structure, making it a sophisticated barbecue wine.
Floral berry, olive and spice aromas make for a rustic nose with polish. This wine feels lively and a bit jumpy, with woody plum and berry flavors that are braced and framed by crisp Patagonian acidity. A lightly herbal, salty finish is powerful but steady. Drink through 2020.
Nice and fruity in cherries, plums and blackberries, and with drier, more complex notes of roasted coffeebean and Asian spices. Overall, this is a dry, layered wine, with a fair amount of gritty tannins.
Elegant, food-friendly and poised, this Chardonnay from Stellenbosch exhibits a combination of fresh Chardonnay fruit, lime and dancing minerality. The nose is light, floral and elegant, and the palate refreshing with bursts of lime and melon. Pair with seafood, pork or fruit.
Made from Zinfandel and Petite Sirah grown in the winery's estate vineyard, this is a fabulous wine. It's high in alcohol and a little hot, but superbly ripe, offering rich waves of raspberry and cherry pie filling, red currant, licorice and mocha, with a sweet-smoke oak flavor. It's delicious and heady on its own, but try it with short ribs, pizza or duck breast with a cherry sauce.
This shows cranberry and herb aromas, along with a floral top note. The palate comes off as sweet and liquorous, with lightly grainy tannins providing support.
It takes only a few moments before you appreciate the enormity, intensity and overall beauty of this landmark wine. Cerretalto is always a high scoring expression of Brunello, but the ideal conditions of the 2007 vintage elevate it to earthly perfection. Dark and fleshy, the wine delivers ever-evolving aromas of dark fruit, chocolate, spice and tobacco. The acidity is carefully balanced against the wine's thickness and rich texture. The finish is long, luscious and elegant. Keep this bottle in your cellar 10 years or more.
From the legendary 1996 vintage, this is a bottling that only received its dosage in 2012. It is very dry, intensely crisp and packed with acidity and minerality. Still young and fruity, it's an impressive wine that will certainly improve with age. Drink through 2022.
This is a wine that has lightness and freshness as dominant characters. Yes, there is fine green fruit, with a backbone structure of white currants, but the acidity, well supported by wood, is what gives the wine shape and a vivid, fresh aftertaste.
This blend of native grapes boasts an aromatic nose of fragrant white flower and yellow stone fruit. The crisp palate offers apricot, lemon zest and hint of nut alongside bright acidity.
The scent is pure Bordeaux, potent and loaded with black cherry, cedar and coffee. The wine hits the palate very soft and quite dry, with a smooth, seamless mouthfeel. It's very tasty, never overbearing, and surprisingly rich in this price range.
Blended with 17% Cabernet Sauvignon and aged for 28 months in French oak, this broad-shouldered red is powerfully concentrated and tightly wound. Raisin cake, cigar box and baked plum play nicely together within an intense texture of leathery spice.

Not a fruity wine, this Kentucky red shows vegetal humus and earth aromas that turn a bit stewed in the mouth. Nonetheless, there's good concentration here and an attractive, vanilla-flavored finish. Drink up.
Aged only in stainless steel, this brilliantly maintains its fresh fruit characteristics. Tree-ripened peach and Golden Delicious apple notes give this wine natural sweetness that isn't overboard or too heavy.
Lemon, butter and marshmallow flavors follow rich butterscotch aromas as this medium-bodied, soft-textured wine spreads its unctuous, candied flavors across the palate. It's very tasty in an extreme, buttery style.
Robert Brittan oversees this project. This first release is a cuvée assembled from a selection of barrels he had vinted at the Carlton Winemakers Studio. Silky and dappled with details of underbrush, bramble, black cherry, cassis, smoke and clean earth, this is a lovely blend with elegance to spare. The low alcohol in no way means this is a thin or shallow wine.
Here's a Pinot to put into your cellar. That's if you can keep from opening it now and savoring the deep, spicy flavors that are so captivating. Offers up layers of cherries, cola, pomegranates, mushrooms, Indian spices and minerals, not to mention a deft touch of sweet, smoky oak. Wonderful tannins and brisk acidity provide balancing structure to the richness. The finish is long. Drink anytime from now through 2017.
This is a zippy little number, with scents of white cherries and citrus that float over a bed of petroleum and fresia. The crisp, off-dry finish winds down to a lingering grapefruit note. Drink now with cod in a miso sauce or stash away for a few years.
A very good wine from a not-so-good vintage. The bouquet hits firmly with black cherry, almond paste, leather and even a touch of refined horseradish. It's as precise and tight as the palate, which offers tannic but rewarding cherry and plum. A lively, racy, real wine that's playing at the highest level. Holding it to high standards, we find it just short of excellent.
The Dion is a new entry in the long list of Erath single-vineyard wines. It doesn't show much in this difficult vintage. Short and intensely herbal, it has strong scents and flavors of tomato leaf, which override any hint of ripe fruit flavor.
Made in the modern style of superripe fruit and lots of oak, this Chardonnay is massive in the long hangtime tropical fruit, pear and peach flavors that the vineyard so easily achieves. It's not complex, but it sure is delicious, oozing with honey and spices. Drink now–2013.
This straightforward red offers aromas and flavors of white rose, red cherry, raspberry and a note of black pepper. Round, smooth tannins and fresh acidity provide the easy drinking framework. Enjoy now.
This focused Rosso di Montefalco (Sangiovese, Merlot and Sagrantino) offers loads of sweet Christmas spice with black fruit, raspberry, tobacco and leather. Lungarotti purchased their Montefalco estate in 2003 and this wine represents the second year of production.
Pretty severe, an acidic, raspingly dry wine and even a tannic one. Shows an astringency rare in Chardonnay, even though there are some good pineapple and buttered toast flavors. Not an ager.
Rooty aromas of licorice, leather and blackberry improve with airing. This shows hard tannins and a grabby palate along with rooty, herbal flavors of blackberry and dark plum that finish with blackened spice notes, licorice root flavors and lively acidity.
Plum, caramel, tobacco and glove-leather aromas show fine depth. Creamy and elegant, the mouthfeel supports the black-plum fruit and toasty, earthy overtones nicely. Finishes with refined tannins and very dark flavors. In its prime now, this is a perfect restaurant wine through 2004. The bank-note label is fun.
Tropical aromas of pineapple and banana are as good as it gets. The palate is lean, acidic and sour, with a distinct briney character. Surprisingly sour and pithy; acceptable but worse than the winery's basic Saurus Chardonnay.
A luscious nose of rich red berry, pepper and black currant is followed by velvety, mouthfilling flavors of tobacco, anise and red berries. Fruity but balanced by good acidity. Pair with lasagna, pizza or ribs. Ready to drink now.
Mar de Palha (seaweed) is a reminder of the closeness of the ocean to the Chocapalha estate. This is a rich, wood-aged wine, full of dark plum and berry fruits with almost-sweet tannins. It's ready to drink in a rich, young fruit way, although it will be even better from 2016.
Stalky, burnt aromas are hardly the welcome mat one is looking for. In the mouth, this is sweet and soft, with a syrupy mouthfeel and candied flavors of berry fruits that come across fake in nature. This is 100% manipulated in style.
This blend of 27% Mourvèdre, 23% Cinsault, 18% Counoise, 17% Grenache and 15% Syrah by the Fess Parker family shows cherry cola and concentrated plum on the nose. Blackberry and other purple fruits power the palate, with aromatic elderflower elements adding complexity.

Fresh and fruity, it shows crispness as well as white fruits, orange zest and a lively lemon aftertaste. Drink now.
A sweet, blueberry-like element to the nose denotes a simple and fruity red wine that is high in drinkability and appeal. Executed in a light, easy style with a luminous color and lean texture, this Nero d'Avola would pair well with roasted chicken or pork.
This is a Rhône-style blend of mostly Grenache and Syrah, with smaller amounts of Viognier and Cinsault. The wine opens with appealing spices, but turns tart and stemmy in the mouth. The spiced plum fruit flavors compete somewhat unsuccessfully with bitter tannins. More bottle age should help.
Master vintner Dick Arrowood has crafted a sensational wine from a sensational vintage. A blend from throughout the county, it shows his discernment in the overall balance, harmony and charm. Black currants, chocolate, green olives, sweet sage and vanilla-scented oak flavors come together in a lush, smooth, intricately structured wine that will probably hold for 10 years, but is best in its flamboyant, exuberant youth.
Young, sharp, oaky and wound up tightly, this is a focused wine of medium concentration. Green and yellow apples hold down the core of fruit, and trail out with a hint of butter on the tongue.

Earthy, floral and berry aromas lead into a palate that offers up creamy cherry, white pepper, licorice and tobacco along with supple tannins. This is already enjoyable so drink soon.

Sugary-sweet and simple, with candied cherry, cola and spice flavors.
Why not? Because the wine smells like soap, and tastes chemically. Something went south with this Zin-based blend.

A very pretty, balanced nose of fresh fruit and flowers, and a flavor profile of good, balanced strawberry fruit and acidity make this wine suitable for everyday drinking and pairing with salads, poultry and fresh fruit. Not terribly complex but tasty for this price. Imported by Cape Wine Ventures, LLC.
An enormous Cabernet, but it's not simply the power of its fruit that's so impressive. Shows massive blackberry, blueberry, crème de cassis and oak flavors packed into profoundly beautiful tannins. The fruit is so sweet that it's surprising how dry the finish is. The winemaker, Ted Henry, also is at the helm of Jarvis. This young Cabernet should develop over the next dozen years, at least, in a good cellar.
The problem with this Zin is high alcohol. In this case, the berry fruit and overall structure just aren't sturdy enough. That lets the alcohol star, making the wine hot and unbalanced.
Cloudy and reddish-brown, this is a funky, spritzy wine with a taste of red cherry that falls somewhat flat on the finish.
A very fresh, crisp wild flavored wine. Deep pink in color, it has considerable acidity to come out of the ripe grapes, very fruity and ready to drink. Screwcap.
Founded in 1936 in the Treviso area of northern Italy, Marsuret offers a clean Prosecco Extra Dry with hints of sweet peach and honey. The sparkling wine is soft and creamy, but offers enough crispness to keep the palate refreshed.
The Blanc de Noir name would suggest it's a sparkling wine; it is not. The label also reads Estate White Wine. It is not. Rather, it is a rosé of Pinot Noir, lightly orange in color. Flavors recall a Pop Tart sort of pastry, simple and slightly sweet.
Substantial and smooth, this full-bodied wine starts slowly with mild fruit and butter aromas, then turns up the volume on the palate with ripe pear, vanilla and nutmeg. It conveys a feeling of oak-aged richness although it was tank-fermented.
Has a pretty color, a nice, ruby translucency, and polished aromas and flavors ranging from ripe cherries and cola to deeper notes of pomegranates and spice. The mouthfeel is delicate and lilting, but the high alcohol, 15.2%, is a little hot on the finish.
Made from a blend of Friulano, Chardonnay and Sauvignon, this rich wine opens with aromas of dried hay, stone fruit and a hint of pastry cream. The creamy palate delivers apricot, yellow peach and lemon drop alongside crisp acidity. It closes on a note  of white almond.
Ripe, soft and rounded, this light, fresh wine has delicious apple and grapefruit flavors, which are rounded out by a generous, creamy texture. It wants for some tautness and minerality.

From a 2,500-foot elevation site, this Cab Franc is intriguingly peppery, light in oak and resplendent in raspberry liqueur aromas and a trace of pine forest. Moderate in tannins and silky in texture it's ready to be enjoyed now with cheese and charcuterie.
Has sweet white fruit aromas, like peaches that have been sitting in the sun too long. Citrusy in the mouth, with a medium body but a flat feel. Finishes with a hint of spice.

A very pretty, polished Pinot Noir, sourced from the cooler, foggier southern part of the valley, near River Road. Shows considerable acidity that stings the palate, but the raspberry, cherry and cola flavors, enhanced with sweet oak, are very rich. Now–2013.
Fresh herb and lime notes brighten this smoky, intensely mineral Riesling. While dry and quite sprightly in style, it has a lush, silky mouthfeel that adds a perception of weight and expansiveness. Drink now through 2018.
This is a new entry from Chile, which blends three-quarters Cab with Merlot to fine results. There's a veneer of toasty oak on the solid nose, which features black cherry at the base. The fruit is bright and berry-driven, while chocolate and refreshing acids work the finish. A step up from the so-called “value blend.” Imported by Cellar Door by Pacific Wine Partners.
The price on this perennial bargain brand from Valentin Bianchi has crept up in recent years, and thus its value potential has stalled somewhat. But it's still a fruity number that once it opens and settles delivers jammy aromas and solid red-berry flavors. We like that it's neither candied nor weedy. 60,000 cases proves that good wine can be made in quantity.
A dull, soft, sugary sweet wine, with candied raspberry and vanilla flavors.
Blossoms and yellow cherries lend a sweet floral flair on the nose of this dry Riesling. It's straightforward in style, but quaffable and refreshing, with flavors of fresh apple and pear that finish crisp and clean.
With 95% Cabernet Franc and only 5% Merlot, there's plenty of floral and leafy, tobacco-like complexities and a certain austerity to the plummy, meaty flavors. Drink over the next few years with grilled or roasted meats.
An elegant Rioja made in a more traditional style. The nose is a little baked and raisiny, with additional aromas of caramel and leather. The palate is where this wine shines: the feel is elegant and smooth, while the cherry and raspberry flavors are subtle and a little bit tangy. Mature and sexy stuff; more classic than modern, but not 100% old-school.
This smooth and fruit-driven wine was blended from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Tempranillo and Petite Sirah, a combo unlikely to appear elsewhere on the globe. The vivid fruit flavors and light tannins lend a nice impression of sweetness.
94-96 Barrel sample. Solid wine, it hides its richness beneath a smooth surface. The tannins feel powerful, but are hard to detect. The wine offers final power.
Lemberger is a soft, rustic, grapey red wine that has long been a favorite of Washington winemakers. It's prolific, undemanding and reliable, and can make for a fine, juicy bottle that's just perfect for picnicking. This is one such wine; the bright fruit has enough acid to keep it from feeling flabby, and if you chill it and pack it on your next picnic, you'll be happy. Best Buy.
Here's a simple and correct Valpolicella that opens with vibrant tones of cherry and ripe raspberry. There's not much depth here, but that's not the point of this wine. Employ it as an easy-drinking red to pair with home cooked pasta.
Ripe, fruity, full flavored wine. It shows its wood aging in the toasty character that lies over the herbaceous fruit. Rounded, smooth with a burst of citrus. Drink next year, but also age.
A solidly tannic wine, the dusty tannins suspended in the chunky fruits. Black currants are prominent, but so is a rich character that is developing well, aided by the sweet wood that balances the wine's initial dryness.
A finely balanced wine with toast and ginger flavors peeking through the ripe peach and apricot fruits. It is striated with minerality giving an intense ageworthy texture. The acidity shows through strongly at the end.

Aged for seven years before disgorging, this deliciously mature wine is full of Pinot Noir richness. It has a warm character that seems to be the style of this producer in the Côte de Sézanne.

This is a rather tense, tightly wound wine, offering tart cranberry and raspberry fruit. Tangy, juicy acidity keeps flavors fresh and forward, with a mineral underpinning.

No it's not a mistake—this is Columbia Valley Washington Pinot Noir. A rare beast, but one that delivers an interesting bottle at this modest price point. Earthy, tannic, even a bit rough, but showing genuine varietal character and enough tart red fruit to provide a counterpoint.
Good value from this dependable nègociant. It shows typical Edna Valley acidity, like the fresh juice from a ripe lime. The flavors veer toward limes, clover honey and vanilla, although the finish is dry and clean.
A single vineyard, 100% varietal Cabernet Sauvignon, this is deep, dark, dense, chewy and tannic. Yet it still captures some delicate floral aromas as well as smoke and rock and black fruits. You go from flower to fruit to earth and black olive in a rush of full-bodied flavor.
It’s tart and earthy, with heavy fruit flavors and some spice in the finish. Nothing elegant here, but it’s a good mouthful of fruit with concentration and a crisp, appley flavor extending through the satisfying finish.
Blueberry, spice, sandalwood and foresty aromas are the good elements; funky, foxy additions not so much. The palate sports a raw, scratchy feel with hard tannins that go with strawberry, plum and vanilla flavors. Tastes and feels lactic on the finish, with a snappy offset. Good Malbec but it struggles to achieve harmony and total balance.
Made with organically grown grapes, this silky and elegant expression of Nebbiolo offers a youthful interpretation of the grape with bright berry notes of cassis, currant and wild raspberry backed by austere aromas of tar, licorice and leather.
Aromas recall fennel, grilled herb, leather, mocha and a whiff of balsam. Reflecting the heat of the vintage, the palate is already evolved but still shows dried black cherry and black pepper. Drink through 2017.

A new offering (and label) from Oregon's King Estate, this sports a label meant to resemble a folded-up piece of note paper with random jottings. On the back label is a sort of freeform poem; in the bottle is a fresh, dry, rather light Riesling. Flavors of lemon and lemon rind, with a papery finish.
From a vineyard just behind Brix restaurant, this is a soft-textured, full-bodied Cab with dark plum and earth flavors. Picks up hints of tobacco and chocolate on the finish.
91—93 Barrel sample. Right in the heart of the city of Libourne, the small L'Enclos vineyard has had considerable investment and produces an impressive, smooth, modern style of wine, very ripe, full of lively acidity.
Powerful tannins dominate this serious wine. It has a complex, dense structure, full of wood and fruit tannins, along with blackberry fruits and a touch of spiced bitter cherry. This is Beaujolais for aging. Give it at least 3–5 years.
Almost like liquid cherry pie—but not sweet—this medium-bodied wine smells like the red fruit and baking spices, and tastes fresh and juicy with both red and sour cherries. It has good heft on the palate due to firm but light tannins and supportive acidity for balance.
This fine wine shows how well the variety grows in Napa Valley. The tannins are lovely and refined, acidity is perfect, the finish is dry, the alcohol isn't too high, and the fruit flavors are ripe and accessible. That resolves most of the problems that plague Petite Sirah. Should develop bottle complexities over the next several years.
This is a no-fussy, watery wine from the Forlì area of Italy (located on the Adriatic flank of the peninsula) that does a good job of washing down informal foods and keeping your palate refreshed. Its measured aromas include dried hay, soft yellow fruit with some nutty tones in the background for additional dimension. The mouthfeel is quick and lean.
A strange orange-pink color for a wine that is somewhere between fruity and sweet and acid and bitter. This one hasn't found a balance.
Blueberry, blackberry, smoke and white pepper unite to create a mysterious, almost brooding impression. This is still tightly coiled, but the flowing, silky-smooth palate with its slender poise and core of freshness suggest that with a little bottle age, this will emerge as a supremely elegant, subtly fruited wine. The finish turns away from darker fruit and ends on ripe, red cherry.
Aromas of char and toast are quite up front, though they smooth out over time and give way to lemon meringue. The tropical fruit, butter and spice flavors are broad and well balanced, with a creamy feel and a lingering finish. The oak gets out front, but there are good things going on.
All six Bordeaux grapes—yes, including Carmenère—are in this fruity blend, aged for 21 months in 80% new French oak and 20% once-used French oak. Plums and cherries, a distinctive whiff of cola, and highlights of cinnamon spice all come together. Tannins are round, almost silky, and the wine fades in a graceful finish.
This tastes a bit over-cropped; the varietal character is there, but it's a pale rendition. Lightly peppery and grassy, with hints of citrus and very green apple fruit. Straightforward and simple.
Apple, melon and a touch of vanilla give a tasty spectrum of aromas and flavors to this medium-bodied wine. It's light enough to sip easily but has a bit of depth to the flavors that makes it interesting.
Deep red plum, dried rose, lavender and oak smoke show on the nose of this bottling from Rick Longoria's estate vineyard, while it also offers a sanguine, feral quality. The palate continues the intrigue, its dried seaweed and wild sagebrush notes giving nuance to the tart strawberry and cranberry fruit.
Jumbled and jumpy on the nose, which struggles to find itself. Time gives this wine a chance to strut, and while it doesn't ever find a great groove it does offer youthful plum and berry flavors followed by resiny tannins. A little too scattered and pocked to rate better.
Black cherry, licorice, loamy soil and a touch of roasted beef show on the nose of this bottling from a beautiful estate in the eastern Santa Ynez Valley. Black cherry, dried dill and fennel, coffee bean and slightly bitter dark chocolate come across on the palate that is still quite young with sticky tannins, though very easy to sip already.
At first, this wine tastes overworked, with very ripe pineapple, lime and mango flavors elaborated with sweet new oak. But then acidity washes in, drying it out, and letting a minerality hit that grounds the wine. If it finished drier, the score would soar.
Still in its shell, this wine has aromas of cocoa, vanilla, spice and dark cherries, showing a mixture of fruit and barrel. The flavors are dense, concentrated and opulent, revealing multiple layers and a hedonistic styling.
With fruit sourced from some of Barolo's best vineyard crus, this beautiful wine offers fullness, character and longevity. Textbook Nebbiolo aromas include wild berry, blue flower, white pepper, cola and tar. The mouthfeel is spicy, fresh and well structured. Pair this wine with steak au poivre (in 5–10 years or so).
A very simple Chardonnay with sour apple flavor.
Smooth and polished, this bears cola, earth, blackberry and floral aromas. It shows power and precision, with silky tannins, integrated acidity and deep flavors of berry, leather and herb. This is slightly minty, smoky and spicy on the back end, where fine oak takes charge. Drink now–2015.
The vineyard is in the coolest part of the Green Valley of the Russian River Valley. The wine, which is totally dry, is marked by brilliant acidity and long hangtime flavors of oranges, Meyer lemons and kiwi fruit, enriched by barrel fermentation and aging.
Citrus aromas and ripe melon flavors give a clean, fruity personality to this medium-bodied wine. Honeydew, mild peach and lemon nuances ride a crisp texture.
This hits the sweet spot between fruit and wood-aging flavors. The red fruit tones have just begun to raisin, touches of wood-aging notes and integrated acidity. Not too sweet, it finishes with a fresh, rich aftertaste.
This lightly aromatic wine offers notes of herbs and kiwi. The flavors and acid seem dilute.
This coral-pink-colored wine brings light aromas of cherry and spice. It drinks a hair off dry, with a rounded, fleshy feel and a mouthwatering finish.
Honey and pear aromas might tease you into thinking this is going to be a fruity wine, but the flavors say otherwise, offering strong heating-oil notes and finishing with mouthwatering balance and stony notes. The stunning minerality of the Doctor vineyard really comes through.
The blend is mostly Merlot, with Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon filling it out. Plenty of stuffing here, with the tannic structure of a pricier wine. Black cherry fruit, some well-modulated bark and herb, and even a bonus lick of licorice in the finish.
Disconnected in its youth, with separate oak and fruit elements that need time to find each other and marry. The oak shows up as caramel and butterscotch, while the fruit stands aloof, in blackberry and black currant superiority. Seems to have the inherent balance for aging. Try after 2013.
This Cabernet Sauvignon-dominant blend boasts leather, tobacco leaf and black pepper flavors, giving it muscle and a rustic edge, the tannins and fruit mellowed with age.
Chard doesn't get any riper, unless it's late harvest. Floods the mouth with peach custard, pineapple, guava, nectarine and apple flavors, with a rich, creamy, oaky finish. It's a bit one-dimensional, but what a tasty dimension.
Big, bold and fruity, this wine shows richness, opulence and swathes of black plum fruit that cushions the structure. Powerful and fruity now, with long aging potential shown by the ample tannins and acid.
Too soft, with unripe cherry and mint flavors that finish with a drily tannic astringency.

From an estate vineyard, this wine combines 60% Cabernet Sauvignon with 20% Malbec and 20% Petit Verdot. Brick tar, blackberry and smoked meat show first, followed by leather and black pepper.

A very good wine, soft and mellow, with a dry finish despite plenty of sweetly ripe fruit. With raspberry, cherry, red licorice and toasty oak flavors, it's delicious. Drink soon alongside a steak, possibly topped with a plum-and-berry salsa.
