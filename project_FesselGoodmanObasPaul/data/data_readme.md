The wine review data that we downloaded from Kaggle is contained in the zip file wine_reviews_split.zip. The total data set was split 80-10-10 percent into training, validation, and test folder. Data details and analysis are in the submitted report.

The files human.txt (real generated wine reviews), and markov.txt (generated wine reviews using the Markov chain model) are combined into a format suitable for Amazon's Mechanical Turk platform. This combined data is the file input.csv.

THe pie chart files are simply summary stats from the MTurk HIT.
