              " \"Mulchy on the nose, with compost, leather and purple fruit notes. There's decent body to the wine but the flavors are stalky and green, with burnt, stemmy leftovers on the finish. A blend of 60% Malbec and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon.\",\n",
              " \"One of Portugal's most popular brands, this is rich, soft, solidly textured. It's a fine blend of five grapes including Syrah and Cabernet, giving a warm, enveloping feel. Acidity offers a balance, leaving a ripe, full flavored wine that needs a few months but is ready now.\",\n",
              " 'A traditional Riesling in the dry style, this wine is crisp and clean to the point of austerity, with the main components reduced to green apple, lime and chalky minerality. Long and tart on the finish. Drink now for its briskness, or try extended aging to see if honeyed complexity emerges in a decade or more.',\n",
              " \"Aliso opens with ripe fruit aromas of blackberry jam and cinnamon bread. It's a simple, plush red wine that would pair well with pasta, meatloaf or roast beef.\",\n",
              " 'With all the freshness given by the Négrette, this is a red fruit dominated wine, its acidity ripe, touched by candy and strawberries. This is a wine to drink now, with all the crispness of 2004 still in place.',\n",
              " 'Plenty of ripe, polished texture.',\n",
              " 'This intriguing blend of Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc works well, displaying richness as well as an intense herbaceousness. This is a lively wine, with its apple and pear flavors, topped with grapefruit acidity.',\n",
              " 'Bright acidity livens it up.',\n",
              " 'This is a lightly aromatic wine, with faint aromas of melon, lemon-lime and yellow flowers. The palate is soft and thin, with similarly delicate flavors as the nose. Drink now.',\n",
              " \"It's fully flavored with black slate flavors, with a nice balance of tannin, it's youthful vitality.\",\n",
              " 'Notable for the cigar lover in your mouth, while white pepper dance on the finish.',\n",
              " \"There's a highly stemmy quality to this interesting wine from one of the appellation's multi-generation families. The nose shows funky herbs, papilla chile and raspberry extract, leading into a very spicy, savory palate of marjoram, Indian spices and green olive laid across pungent cranberry fruits. It's a winner for fans of stem inclusion.\",\n",
              " 'It is light but sweetly ripe orange, peach and citrus.',\n",
              " 'Spicy, sharp and tight, this is packed with compact herbs, spicy fruit, smoke and black tar. Tannins remain sharp-edged and a bit unforgiving for now. Very young, herbal and aggressive, this is a wine that has the structure and power to develop complex, unique flavors in the bottle. Definitely needs more time.',\n",
              " 'Fragrant red and black currant aromas pervade on the nose of this blend of Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. A lively palate of tart berries and worn leather is supported by chalky tannins and vibrant acidity.',\n",
              " 'This 100% varietal wine is a blend of fruit from Grand Ciel (42%), Upchurch (31%), Ciel du Cheval (19%) and Klipsun vineyards. Wound-up aromas of black cherry and barrel spice are followed by pitch-black-fruit flavors, with the tannins combed to a fine sheen. It flat out impresses.',\n",
              " 'This will certainly develop and it moves nicely through the finish.',\n",
              " 'After eight years of experience result in a medium- to full-bodied wine.',\n",
              " 'Rather oily and hard on the nose, with dried cheese, brett, mint and black fruit. The palate is rich and extremely forward, and the flavors are sweet but not that substantive or complex. Chocolate and mocha on the finish are about as much carry-through as you get.',\n",
              " \"There is some green bean and ashtray aromas on the nose, but also some maple-like wood. The palate is also slightly green at its center, but surrounding that is a fair amount of plum and cranberry. The finish is smooth, properly textured and tannic enough to create a dry, cheek-gripping feel. There's definitely some character here.\",\n",
              " \"This is a perfectly good, honest Chilean SB with snappy, pungent aromas of gooseberry, grapefruit and lime. The mouth is racy as it should be, with textbook lime, grapefruit, nettle and pithy flavors. If there's any drawback, it's on the finish, which ends with bitterness.\",\n",
              " 'Deep ruby to the generous mouthfeel and a polished feel in the mouth over a lean texture and lots of fare, from Indian Wells, this is a fine swathe of richness on the palate.',\n",
              " 'This medium-weight, fleshy Sauvignon offers aromas of ripe gooseberries and stone fruits, then backs that up with nectarine and citrus, just tinged with herbal character. Good length on the finish for such an inexpensive wine, a tribute to winemaking consultant Alan McCorkindale. Imported by Precept Brands.',\n",
              " \"There's a tiny bit of effervescence in this twist-top bottling, which shows light cola, red cherry and pencil shaving notes on the nose. The entry to the palate is soft, bringing tart cranberry and thyme flavors, with a light vanilla note on the finish.\",\n",
              " \"This is a fruity, juicy wine that Heifara Swartvagher made to be drunk young. With black currant freshness over firm, dry tannins, it's ripe, packed with attractive fruitiness and ready to drink.\",\n",
              " 'From three vineyards, including Roberts Road, this wine impresses in floral honeycomb and a freshness that belies its medium-bodied weight and pithy texture, finishing in vanilla that never gets sweet.',\n",
              " 'A nose of this full-bodied, complex sipper, with a smoky character that lies lightly on lifted aromatics, and a touch of grace.',\n",
              " 'The finest Jester Cabernet I can remember, this full-bodied yet supple wine features aromas of cassis, cedar and vanilla in fine balance. Cassis and chocolate flavors continue in the same vein, followed by a silky, long finish. Drink now–2028.',\n",
              " \"Where Beaulieu's Private Reserve has been rescued from being cloying.\",\n",
              " 'Rich and soft, this Castelão-based rosé seems to miss out on freshness and acidity. Instead, it is broad, full in the mouth and heavy. It could work with food.',\n",
              " \"Fronton's Négrette grape is found in few other places. Made 100% from the single variety, this wine displays the grape's juicy character as well as the spice and violet aromas and damson flavors. The wine is made to be drunk young.\",\n",

              " 'Pure Syrah from the Boushey Vineyard, this was barrel aged in a mix of half new Russian and French oak. Citrusy acids brighten up this wine, where the tight-wound, tangy red fruit flavors suggest wild, just-picked raspberries. With excellent concentration and focus, this is a wine to cellar for up to a decade.',\n",
              " 'The oak is in its sweet, juicy fruit flavors.']"
