Drink through 2017.","Classic Carmenère aromas of coconut, vanilla, blackberry and cherry, completely enveloped in mellow tannins.","This is a great example of a lower alcohol, somewhat underripe Pinot Noir that shows solid depth and lovable freshness. Lively aromas of black-raspberry sorbet and dark strawberry show on the nose, while the palate picks up a tart cranberry character. White pepper, thyme and juniper enliven the fruity flavors.","An enticing smell of roasted coffee notes and ample acidity.","With rich, fine tannins and a grilled meat edge to the blackberry, currant and black pepper flavors, this bone-dry Syrah offers lots of pleasure. If it were more concentrated, the score would soar, but still, it's a pretty elegant wine.","That gives wines with true global appeal.","From a number of old-vine parcels, designated in the past as L-O and only produced in the best years, this wine is beautifully ripe with great layers of rich apple and pear fruits. They are cut with zesty acidity and a more mineral aspect. The wine still needs to age further, so drink from 2019.","true","false","false","false","true","false","false","true","false","false","true","false","false","true","false","false","true","false","false","false","true","false","false","true","true","false","false","false","true","false"
